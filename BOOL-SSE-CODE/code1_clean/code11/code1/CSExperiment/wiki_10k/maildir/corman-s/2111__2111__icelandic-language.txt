It is a Germanic languages. It comes from the Old Norse language, the language spoken by the Vikings. Because Iceland is far away from other countries, the language has not changed much. Icelandic people can still read words from hundreds of years ago. Icelandic uses four Letters that are not used in English language: þ (thorn), (like 'th' in thin), ð (edh), (like 'th' in this), æ (pronounced like I) and ö (pronounced like the French U). It can also be said that ð is a "softer" version of þ. Some linguists say there are only two Nordic languages, Eastern-Nordic and Western-Nordic, which includes Icelandic and Faroese because of their similarity. Icelandic is also one of the most difficult languages to learn. ==References== Category:North Germanic languages Category:Languages of Europe Category:Icelandic culture
