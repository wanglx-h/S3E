They started in East Sussex. They are known for using pianos and their little use of guitars in their music. Tim Rice-Oxley and Dominic Scott composed the songs that the band played from 1997 to 2001. When Dom left in 2001, Tim composed all the future songs. ==History== ===Beginning (1995 - 2003)=== Pianist Tim Rice-Oxley and singer Tom Chaplin were friends since they were kids. Rice-Oxley's brother was born on the same day and hospital in 1979. They studied at Vinehall School and later at Tonbridge School. There, they met the other member of the band, Richard Hughes. Tim made the band in 1995 with his friend Dominic Scott. They named the band "The Lotus Eaters". They changed their name to "Cherry Keane" in 1997, when Chaplin entered the band. Cherry Keane was a woman who served tea at Tim and Tom's school. The name changed again to "Keane". In an interview on 2006, Rice-Oxley said that the band was called Coldplay, but he gave this name to a friend (Chris Martin, of Coldplay). Keane began playing songs by other artists, but soon they wanted to play their own songs. Their first live performance (gig) was in 1998, at the "Hope & Anchor" pub (Bar (business)) in England. They made 2 CDs and sold at the pubs where they played. Scott left the band in 2001. Tim wrote "Everybody's Changing" for this. In December 2002, Simon Williams of Fierce Panda went to a Keane gig in and he offered to make the band's next and first commercial single (song), "Everybody's Changing". The single was released on 2003. ===Hopes and Fears (2003 - 2006)=== After another single, in 2004, Island Records invited Keane to make a Single (music) with them. "Everybody's Changing" was made after "Somewhere Only We Know". An album was released in May and called "Hopes And Fears". The album was very successful and it was the second best-seller album of the year. The album sold five million (5,000,000) copies. In 2006, they competed for a Grammy but they lost. ===Under the Iron Sea (2005 - 2006)=== Keane began recording their second album, "Under the Iron Sea", in 2005, with producer Andy Green. The first two singles from the album were "Atlantic (single)" and "Is It Any Wonder?". Now, the album has sold one million (2,000,000) copies in the world. ===Perfect Symmetry (2008)=== Their third album is called ''Perfect Symmetry'' produced with Island Records. It was released 13 October 2008 to favourable reviews. According to international Island Records manager, Jon Turner, "the general international feel is of excitement and 'Spiralling' is a favourite track of the US company.". The album included the singles "Spiralling", "The Lovers Are Losing", "Perfect Symmetry" and "Better Than This". ===Strangeland (2011-2012)=== The band's fourth album was released in May 2012 through Island Records. It went straight to No.1 in the UK Albums Chart. It included the singles "Silenced By The Night", "Disconnected", "Sovereign Light Cafe" and "Black Rain". The album cover is photographed in Bexhill-On-Sea in East Sussex, which is where the Sovereign Light Cafe is located and where the video for "Sovereign Light Cafe" was filmed. === Cause & Effect (2018-2019) === The band's fifth album after a five-year hiatus released on September 20th 2019. The band got together in 2018 and started to work on a new album after Rice-Oxley had been through a divorce and Chaplin had been through therapy for addiction. It included the singles "The Way I Feel", "Love Too Much" and "Stupid Things". It reached number 2 in the charts. ==Equipment list== This is a list of Keane's equipment. * Piano: ** Yamaha CP70B Electric piano ** Yamaha CP70M Electric piano * Synthesizers: ** Rhodes Suitcase Piano ** Nord Lead 3 ** Yamaha CP60M * Bass guitar: ** Fender Precision Bass ** Fender Jazz ** Yamaha CP35 Bass synthesizer ** Yamaha DX-7 synthesizer * Organ (music): ** Hammond XK2 * Drums: ** Yamaha Maple Custom "Absolute Nouveau" * Microphones: ** Sennheiser e602s/e604s/e935s/421 ** Shure Beta 57/91 * Other: ** Apple Computer PowerBook G4 Titanium ** Apple PowerMac G5 ==Members== * Tim Rice-Oxley - piano, Bass (instrument), keyboards, backing singer * Tom Chaplin - singer, live keyboards, Organ (instrument) * Richard Hughes - drums * Dominic Scott - guitar, Keyboard instrument (left in 2001) ==Discography== Keane releases: ===Singles (songs)=== * "Call Me What You Like" (1996) * "Wolf At The Door" (1997) * "Everybody's Changing" (1999) * "This Is The Last Time" (1999) * "Somewhere Only We Know" (2000) * "Everybody's Changing" (2000) (made again) * "Bedshaped" (2000) * "This Is the Last Time" (2000) (made again) * "Bend and Break" (2001) * "Atlantic (Song)" (2002) * "Is It Any Wonder?"
