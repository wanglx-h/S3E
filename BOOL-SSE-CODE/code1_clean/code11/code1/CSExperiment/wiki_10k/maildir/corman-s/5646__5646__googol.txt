The number of the same name is also known as ten thousand sexdecillion. A 9-year-old Milton Sirotta, nephew of U.S. mathematician Edward Kasner, first used the word "googol". Sirotta made this word in 1937, for the number represented by the numeral 1 followed by 100 zeros.He may have been inspired by the comic strip character Barney Google. The company Google was named after the number "googol". Its creators originally called it BackRub because it used backlinks to tell how important each page was. Someone suggested "googolplex". They shortened it to "googol" and then spelled the word wrong when looking for a domain name that was not yet taken. ==Related pages== * Graham's number * Googolplex, which is 10googol ==References== Category:Numbers ==Note (Please don't delete this.)== Google Search was meant to be named Googol but they misspelled it and they just kept it.
