File:HiroshimaGroundZeroMarker6952.jpg '''Ground zero''' is the name for the exact place where an explosion occurs. It is the place where the most :wikt:damage happens. The farther away from ground zero, the less damage there is. Sometimes, people say "ground zero" about a famous explosion, like the atomic bomb in Hiroshima or the September 11 attacks. These places can have special markers at ground zero. Category:Physics
