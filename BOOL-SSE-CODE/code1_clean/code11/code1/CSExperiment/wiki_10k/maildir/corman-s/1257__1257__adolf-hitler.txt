He rose to power as the leader of the Nazi Party, becoming the chancellor in 1933 and then taking the title of ''Führer und Reichskanzler'' (Führer and Chancellor of the Reich) in 1934. His invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939 marked the start of the Second World War. He was closely involved in military operations throughout the war and was central to the perpetration of the Holocaust: the genocide of about six million Jews and millions of other victims. Hitler was born in Braunau am Inn in Austria-Hungary and was raised near Linz. He lived in Vienna in the first decade of the 1900s before moving to Germany in 1913. He was decorated during his service in the German Army in World War I, receiving the Iron Cross. In 1919, he joined the German Workers' Party (DAP), the precursor of the Nazi Party. Hitler became the leader of the Nazi Party in 1921. In 1923, he attempted to seize governmental power in a Beer Hall Putsch in Munich and was imprisoned with a sentence of five years. In jail, he dictated the first volume of his autobiography and political manifesto ''Mein Kampf'' ("My Struggle"). He led them to become the most powerful political party in Germany after the 1932 elections. He began running the government when he became the Chancellor of Germany in 1933. The Nazis banned all other political parties and turned Germany into a dictatorship (meaning that the government was ruled by one person). Hitler's dictatorship is known as Nazi Germany, also known as the "Third Reich" (meaning "Third Empire" or "Third Realm"). Hitler called himself the ''Führer'' (meaning "leader") after the year 1934. Hitler ordered the takeover of Poland in 1939, and this started World War II in Europe. Hitler made all the important decisions during the war. At first, Nazi Germany did well in the war, but by 1945 they were losing. On 29 April 1945, Hitler married his longtime lover, Eva Braun, in the ''Führerbunker'' in Berlin. Less than two days later, Hitler and Braun Death of Adolf Hitler as the Soviet Army got to Berlin, because they did not want to be captured alive by the Soviet Union. Because of the Nazi government, at least 50 million people died. About 28.7 million soldiers and people died in the fighting. The war also killed 19.3 million civilians and prisoners of war. Nazi forces committed many war crimes and atrocities during the war.This applies mainly to the SS: the Schutzstaffel, which was the Nazi security and military organisation. The regular army, known as the Wehrmacht, was a separate organisation. They killed their enemies sometimes with Einsatzgruppen or put them in concentration camps and Extermination camp. Hitler and his men Persecution and killed Jews and other ethnic Group, religion, and politics minority. In what is called the Holocaust, the Nazis killed six million Jews, Roma people, Homosexuality, Slavs, and Holocaust victims. == Family background == Hitler's family was born in Waldviertel, in Lower Austria. At the time, the name ''Hitler'' changed in this region several times between ''Hüttler'', ''Hiedler'', ''Hittler'' and ''Hitler''. The name was commonly in the German language-speaking area of Europe in the 19th century. The literature says that this name is descended from the Czech language name ''Hidlar'' or ''Hidlarcek''. == Childhood and early adulthood == File:Volksbücherei Braunau 03.jpg Adolf Hitler was born on 20 April 1889, as the fourth child of six in Braunau am Inn. This is a small town near Linz in the province of Upper Austria, close to the border with Germany. At the time, the town was in Austria-Hungary. His parents were Klara Pölzl and Alois Hitler. Because of his father's job, Hitler moved from Braunau to Passau, later to Lambach and finally to Leonding. He attended several Volksschule's. Hitler's mother, Klara Pölzl, was his father's third wife and also his cousin. Hitler's father died in 1903. Hitler was born with only one testicle. Hitler failed high school exams in Linz twice. In 1905, he left school. He became interested in the Anti-Semitism (anti-Jewish), Pan-German movement teachings of Professor Leopold Poetsch. In September 1907, he went to Vienna and took an entrance examination. On 1 and 2 October, he failed the second examination. Hitler went back to Linz at the end of October. In December 1907, Hitler's mother died and, because of that, he was Major depressive disorder. Hitler's mother was Catholicism, but Hitler is not known to have been personally interested in Christianity.Alan Bullock; Hitler: a Study in Tyranny; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p218 In 1909, Hitler again went to Vienna to study art. He tried to become a student at the Academy of Arts, but failed the first entrance examination. He made many paintings and sold them at low prices. Hitler said he first became an anti-Semite in Vienna. This city had a large Jewish community. In 1913, Hitler was 24 years old. At that time, all young Austrian men had to join the army. Hitler did not like the Austrian army and the Austro-Hungarian Empire because of its many ethnic groups, so he left Austria for Germany. He lived in the German city of Munich. == World War I == File:Hitler WWI.jpg On 16 August 1914, Hitler joined the Bavarian army. He fought for the German Empire in World War I. Hitler served in Belgium and France in the 16th Bavarian Reserve Regiment. He spent nearly the whole time on the Western Front. He was a runner, one of the most dangerous jobs on the Front. That means he ran from one position to another, carrying messages. On 1 November 1914, Hitler became a Gefreiter (which was like being a private first class in the United States Army, or a lance corporal in the British Army). The government awarded him the Iron Cross Second Class on 2 December 1914. On 5 October 1916, Hitler was hurt by a Shell (weapons). Between 9 October and 1 December, he was in the military hospital ''Belitz''. In March 1917, he went back to the front. There, he fought in a battle and was awarded with the Military Merit Cross (Austria–Hungary). In March 1918, Hitler participated in the Spring Offensive. On 4 August 1918, Hitler was awarded the Iron Cross First Class by the Jewish Hugo Gutmann. After Armistice with Germany (Compiègne), Hitler was shocked, because the German army still held enemy area in November 1918. == Entry into politics == File:Hitler's DAP membership card.png After World War I, Hitler stayed in the army and returned to Munich. There he attended the funeral march of the Bavarian prime minister Kurt Eisner, who had been killed. In 1919, he participated in a training programme for propaganda speakers from 5 to 12 June and 26 June to 5 July. Later that year, Hitler joined a small political party called the German Workers Party. He became member number 555. He soon won the support of the party's members. Two years later, he became the party's leader. He renamed the party the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei. It became known as the Nazi Party. == During the Weimar Republic == File:Bundesarchiv Bild 119-0289, München, Hitler bei Einweihung "Braunes Haus".jpg In 1923, Hitler got together several hundred other members of the Nazi Party and tried to take over the Weimar Republic government (1918–34) in the Beer Hall Putsch. The coup failed. The government killed 13 of his men (the 13 dead men were later declared saints in Nazi ideology). They also put Hitler in the Landsberg Prison. They said that he would stay in prison for five years, but they let him leave after nine months. ==''Mein Kampf''== File:Erstausgabe von Mein Kampf.jpg While Hitler was in prison, he wrote a book with the help of his close friend Rudolf Hess. At first, Hitler wanted to call the book ''Four and a Half Years of Struggle against Lies, Stupidity and Cowardice''. In the end, he called the book "''Mein Kampf''" ("My Struggle"). ''Mein Kampf'' brought together some of Hitler's different ideas and explains where they came from:Laurence Rees; ''The Dark Charisma of Adolf Hitler''; Ebury Press 2012; pp. 61–62 * His idea that the "Aryan race" was better than everybody else: This came from Arthur de Gobineau's book called ''The Inequality of the Human Races''. * His plans for an Empire in the East: These plans came from the way Germany had captured farming land in the First World War. * His idea that democracy (rule by governments vote in elections) should be replaced by dictatorship (rule by one man) * The idea that Judaism and communism were connected: He got this idea from the Nazi writer Alfred Rosenberg. * His anger against the Jews. He suggests that they should be killed, though he is not clear about how this should be done.Kershaw, 2008, pages, 148-50 Hitler may also have been influenced by Martin Luther's ''On the Jews and their Lies''. In ''Mein Kampf'', Hitler says Martin Luther was "a great warrior, a true statesman and a great reformer." == Rise to power == File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1972-026-11, Machtübernahme Hitlers.jpg In January 1933, Hitler was Election into the German government and became a dictator in the next months. He ended freedom of speech, freedom of the press and put his enemies in prisons and concentration camps or killed them. He banned every other political party except the Nazi Party by the summer of 1933 and Germany became a one-party state. Hitler and his propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels, spread extreme nationalism within Germany. All Mass media came under the control of the Nazi Party and they had to praise Hitler and the Nazis. Also, more people were born because Hitler wanted more people of the "master race" (those he called "Aryans"). After the death of Paul von Hindenburg in 1934, Hitler declared the office of President vacant and made himself ''Führer'' (both Head of State and Head of Government) and became a full dictator with no checks and balances. He made Germany a totalitarianism fascist dictatorship. Hitler was also responsible for the Beer Hall Putsch. In the Night of the Long Knives he had Ernst Röhm the head of the Sturmabteilung killed by Heinrich Himmler, Reinhard Heydrich and the SS. They were also involved in the Kristallnacht (1938). == World War II == File:Flag of Germany (1935–1945).svg was the emblem and flag of Germany from 1935 to 1945 used by Hitler.]] Hitler is credited with starting World War II on September 1, 1939 by Invasion of Poland (1939). His army Military occupation western Poland, and later most of Europe, including France and a large part of the Soviet Union. == The Holocaust == File:Selection on the ramp at Auschwitz-Birkenau, 1944 (Auschwitz Album) 1a.jpg During the war, Hitler ordered the Nazis to kill many people, including women and children. The Nazis killed around six million Jews in the Holocaust. Holocaust victims were Roma people (Gypsies), homosexuals, Slavs such as Russians and Poland, and his political opponents.Hitler spared his Jewish teacher also. Finally, Allies of World War II worked together to defeat Germany. Hitler lost all of the lands that he had taken. Millions of Germans were killed in the war. At the end of World War II, Hitler gave all people in the ''Führerbunker'' permission to leave it. Many people did and moved to the region of Berchtesgaden. They used Fixed-wing aircraft and truck convoys. Hitler, the Göbbels family, Martin Bormann, Eva Braun and some other wikt:staff remained in the bunker. Hitler married Eva Braun on 29 April 1945. ==Death== File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-V04744, Berlin, Garten der zerstörte Reichskanzlei.jpg, where Hitler spent the last months of his life]] File:Stars & Stripes & Hitler Dead2.jpg Forty hours after Hitler and Eva Braun got married in Berlin, Germany, both of them committed suicide: Eva Braun, by poisoning with cyanide; Hitler also gave some to his German Shepard. Then, Hitler committed suicide by shooting himself in the head with his gun. Before this, Hitler ordered that their body be burned after they were dead. This prevented him from being captured alive by soldiers of the Red Army, who were closing in on him. Despite this, there are Conspiracy theory that Hitler did not die in 1945, but that he instead escaped to Argentina. These theories are very unpopular, with most historians dismissing them. ==Hitler in history== Ian Kershaw, a historian who wrote a biography (life story) of Hitler, describes him as a modern symbol of evil. "Never in history has such ruination ... been [linked] with the name of one man."Kershaw, 2000, pages xvii and 841 However, Kershaw and some other historians believe that it is more important to look at the wider problems in Germany at the time, rather than at Hitler himself, to explain why the war and the Holocaust happened.Kershaw, 2008, xxxv–xxxvi == Related pages == * Nazism * Nazi Party * Fascism * Racism * World War II * ''Mein Kampf'' * Anti-Romani sentiment == References == ==Other websites== * * * == More reading == * * * * * * * Category:1889 births Category:1945 deaths Category:Adolf Hitler Category:Hitler family Category:Nazi leaders Category:Former dictators Category:Austrian painters Category:Austrian politicians Category:German war criminals Category:Former good articles Category:Former Roman Catholics Category:Holocaust perpetrators Category:Austrian war criminals Category:Antisemitism in Europe Category:Time People of the Year Category:Antisemitism in Germany Category:People from Upper Austria Category:Presidents of Nazi Germany Category:Nazis who committed suicide Category:Chancellors of Nazi Germany Category:20th-century German painters Category:Ministers-President of Prussia Category:Suicides by firearm in Germany Category:Politicians who committed suicide Category:Members of the Reichstag (Nazi Germany) Category:German military personnel of World War I Category:German military personnel of World War II Category:Members of the Reichstag (Weimar Republic) Category:People with borderline personality disorder Category:20th-century rulers Category:20th-century presidents of Germany
