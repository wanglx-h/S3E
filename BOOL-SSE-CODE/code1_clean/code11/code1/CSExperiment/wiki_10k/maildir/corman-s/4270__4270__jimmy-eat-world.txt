They formed in Mesa, Arizona in 1994. To date, they have released nine studio albums. They have released many singles, including ''Sweetness (song)'', ''The Middle'', ''Bleed American'', ''Rockstar'', and ''Let It Happen''. They used to be part of the emo scene and many would still call them that. However, the band has never liked that term and do not even understand that. While their albums do have considerable emo influences, the album ''Futures'' brought on a change of sound and a different fanbase. ==Albums== ===Studio albums=== * ''Jimmy Eat World'' - 1994 * ''Static Prevails'' - 1996 * ''Clarity'' - 1999 * ''Bleed American'' - 2001 * ''Futures'' - 2004 * ''Chase This Light'' - 2007 * ''Invented (album)'' - 2010 * ''Damage'' (2013) * ''Integrity Blues (2016) * ''Surviving'' (2019) ===EPS=== *One Two Three - 1994 *Jimmy Eat World (EP) - 1998 *Firestarter - 2000 *Good To Go - 2002 *Stay On My Side Tonight - 2005 ==References== ==Other websites== * [http://www.jimmyeatworld.com/invented/ Jimmy Eat World's Official website] Category:American rock bands Category:American punk bands Category:Emo bands Category:Musical groups from Arizona Category:1990s American music groups Category:2000s American music groups Category:People from Mesa, Arizona Category:Musical groups established in 1993 Category:1993 establishments in the United States Category:1990s establishments in Arizona
