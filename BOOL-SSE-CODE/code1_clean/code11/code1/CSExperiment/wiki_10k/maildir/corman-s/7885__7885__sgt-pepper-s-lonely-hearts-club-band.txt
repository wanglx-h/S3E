}} '''''Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band''''' is an album released by the Beatles. It was the eighth Beatles album released in the United Kingdom. It was released on 1 June 1967. It was at the top of music charts in the UK for twenty-seven weeks. It has many well-known songs, such as "When I'm Sixty-Four" and "A Day in the Life", which John Lennon and Paul McCartney worked on together. For a while before this album came out, The Beatles had been trying new things when they made records, but this album made a much bigger change in the way they sounded. The album title was used later for a 1978 Universal Pictures movie. Peter Frampton and the Bee Gees played Sgt. Pepper's band, while Billy Preston was the Sergeant. George Burns played Mr. Kite (the mayor), Steve Martin (in his first film) played Maxwell Edison, and Aerosmith was the Future Villain Band. It consistently holds the top spot on critics' lists of the greatest albums of all time. ==Songs on the album== ==Sources== Category:The Beatles albums Category:1967 albums Category:Concept albums Category:Rock albums Category:Grammy Award-winning albums
