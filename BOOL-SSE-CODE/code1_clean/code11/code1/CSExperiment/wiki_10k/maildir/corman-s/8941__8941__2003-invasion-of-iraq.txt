The main reason that the invasion started was said to be because the British and American Governments believed that Iraq had dangerous weapons of mass destruction (such as chemical weapon or nuclear weapons) that could be used against other countries. This turned out after the invasion to not be true. Another reason for the start of the invasion was that many people thought that Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, one of the leaders of al-Qaeda, was hiding in Iraq after the September 11, 2001 attacks. Though Saddam Hussein was not involved in the planning of the September 11 attacks, many people accused him of giving al-Qaeda a safe place to hide from the United States. The invasion was extremely controversial. Many British and American people blamed British Prime Minister Tony Blair and the American President, George W. Bush. American and British paratroopers landed in the far north of Iraq and a few soldiers attacked from the sea, but most invaded from Kuwait in the south. The combined forces proceeded to advance and capture Baghdad. 4,734 NATO soldiers were killed in Iraq war including 4,600 U.S. servicemen, 179 UK servicemen and 139 Other NATO soldiers with a total of 4900 casualties. 31,882 U.S. servicemen and over 3,600 UK servicemen were wounded in Iraq. More than 180,000 Iraqi civilians who were not soldiers were also killed. ==Aftermath== The United Nations Secretary-General said that "[F]rom our point of view and from the Charter point of view [the war] was illegal." == Related pages == * Saddam Hussein * Execution of Saddam Hussein * Uday Hussein * Qusay Hussein ==References== == Other websites == * [https://www.britannica.com/event/Iraq-War Encyclopedia Britannica's Article on 2003 War] * [http://www.comw.org/warreport/ War Report.] More than 5,000 articles, documents and analyses of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, updated four times a week—Project on Defense Alternatives. * [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7634313/ CIA’s final report] * [http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/project.jsp?project=us_occupation_of_iraq Occupation of Iraq] Timeline at the History Commons * [http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/11/12/baghdad.morgue.ap/index.html Morgues so full, bodies turned away] * [http://www.warincontext.org The War In Context] News aggregator * [http://www.usiraqprocon.org/ ProCon's examination of Iraq Invasion] * [http://www.turkishweekly.net/editorial.php?id=7 by Professor Dr. Sedat Laciner, "Ten Impasses of the Resistance in Iraq"] * [http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/engMDE140082001?OpenDocument&of=COUNTRIESIRAQ?OpenDocument&of=COUNTRIESIRAQ Amnesty International Report on Iraq] Category:2003 in Asia Category:Iraq War Category:Arab–Israeli conflict Category:George W.
