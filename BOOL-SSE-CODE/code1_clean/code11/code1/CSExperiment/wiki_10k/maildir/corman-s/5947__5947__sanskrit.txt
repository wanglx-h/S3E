Many languages in the Indian subcontinent today are derived from Sanskrit. Today, only about 14,000 people use it as their daily language. Sanskrit is a standardized dialect of Indo-Aryan languages#Old Indo-Aryan and has a linguistic ancestry that can be traced back to Proto-Indo-European. The Indo-European Aryan migration theory proposes that the Indo-Europeans migrated from the Central Asian steppes into the Indian subcontinent during the early 2nd millennium BC and brought the Indo-European language Sanskrit with them.Witzel, Michael 2005. Indocentrism. In Bryant, Edwin & Patton, Laurie L. ''The Indo-Aryan controversy: evidence and inference in Indian history''. London: Routledge. The main script used to write Sanskrit today is Devanagari. Historically, it was also written in the Kharoshti and Brahmic scripts. William Jones, working as a judge in India in the 18th century, studied Sanskrit and recognised its similarities to Latin, Greek language and other European languages. That led to the Indo-European languages being recognised as a group of related languages stretching from Europe to India. It is also one of the 22 officially recognised languages of India. ==Literature== Sanskrit literature includes poetry and drama and has also scientific, technical, Hindu philosophy and dharma texts. Sanskrit continues to be widely used as a sacred language in Hinduism religious rituals, and also some Buddhism and Jainism practice in the form of hymns and mantras. ==Grammar== Sanskrit has a very complex grammar, with eight case (grammar), three Grammatical gender, and three grammatical number. Words are also described based on their qualities.
