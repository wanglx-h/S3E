It is a about ethics. The word "utilitarianism" comes from the word "utility", which means "usefulness". In most forms of utilitarianism, things that increase human wikt:well-being or happiness are called useful. This is not limited to the happiness caused by a single action but also includes the happiness of all people involved and all future consequentialism. In general, the theory of utilitarianism is that whatever brings the most happiness to the greatest number of people is the right thing to do. == History == The theory was made popular by 18th century and 19th century England philosopher like Francis Hutcheson, Jeremy Bentham, and John Stuart Mill, but the idea goes all the way back to Ancient history times. Bentham wrote about this idea with the words "The greatest good for the greatest number," but did not use the word ''utilitarianism''. It was Mill, a follower of Bentham's ideas, who named the idea. == Utilitarianism in Practice == Many philosophers argue that utilitarianism has important practical implications for how we should live ethically. For instance, according to utilitarianism we should help Poverty, prevent animal suffering, and ensure that future generations have good lives. == Related pages == *Hedonism *Happiness pump == References == Category:Philosophical movements and positions Category:Ethics
