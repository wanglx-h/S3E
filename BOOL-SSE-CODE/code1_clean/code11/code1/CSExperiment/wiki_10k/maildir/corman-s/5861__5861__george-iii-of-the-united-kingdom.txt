'''George III''' (born George William Frederick, 4 June 1738 - 29 January 1820) was Monarchy of the United Kingdom and Monarchy of Ireland from 25 October 1760 until 1 January 1801. He was then King of the United Kingdom until his death. During George III's reign, his home country lost many of its colony in North America (they became the United States), and his two kingdoms Kingdom of Great Britain and Kingdom of Ireland were merged into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Also during his reign Great Britain and its successor the United Kingdom were at war with republican and Napoleonic France and won the war against it. Also during George III's reign his land in Hanover, Germany became a kingdom. He suffered from periodic bouts of insanity. One of these caused a regency crisis in 1788 during which the kingdom of Ireland attempted unsuccessfully to nominate his son George IV as regent. He quickly recovered preventing this.''Ireland and the British Empire'' ed.
