Subject: Holocaust denial
'''Holocaust denial''', or '''Holocaust distortion''', refers to the false belief that the Holocaust did not happen, or was not as bad as it was. ==Background== File:Auschwitz I Barracks.jpg.]]File:Auschwitz Memorial to Last Prisoners Killed.jpgFile:Holocaust Denial Laws.svg with Law against Holocaust denial.]] Various groups and organisations use different definitions of what Holocaust denial is. One of these is the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance. A trend of Holocaust denial, some state-sponsored, is seen in other List of European countries, including Austria, Croatia, * * * * * Czechia, Hungary, * * * Germany, Italy and Poland. * Robert Rozett, “Competitive Victimhood and Holocaust Distortion,” ''The Israel Journal of Foreign Affairs'', XVI (2022); “Distorting the Holocaust and Whitewashing History: Toward a Typology,” XIII: 1 (2019); Yehuda Bauer, “Creating a “Usable” Past: On Holocaust Denial and Distortion,” XIV: 2 (2022); and Jan Grabowski (historian), “The Holocaust and Poland's 'History Policy'” X: 3 (2016). * Joanna Beata Michlic, “The Politics of the Memorialisation of the Holocaust in Poland: Reflections on the Current Misuses of the History of Rescue,” ''Jewish Historical Studies—Transactions of the Jewish Historical Society of England'', LIII: 1 (2022); Piotr Forecki, ''Po Jedwabnem: Anatomia pamięci funkcjonalnej'' (Kraków, 2018); Jan Gross, ''Neighbors: The Destruction of the Jewish Community in Jedwabne'' (Princeton, 2001). * Piotr Forecki, “Domestic ‘Assassins of Memory’: Various Faces of Holocaust Revisionism in Contemporary Poland,” presentation at a symposium in honor of Professor Antony Polonsky called “The Holocaust in Eastern Europe: sources, memory, politics,” March 16, 2021, UCL, London. * * Antony Polonsky and Joanna Beata Michlic (eds.), ''The Neighbors Respond: The Controversy over the Jedwabne Massacre in Poland'' (Princeton, 2009) and Laurence Weinbaum, “Amnesia and Antisemitism in the ‘Second Jagiellonian Age,’” ''Anti-Judaism, Antisemitism, and Delegitimizing Israel'', Robert Wistrich (ed.)

Some described the phenomenon with the concept ''mnemonic politics'', where nationalist governments distorted the Holocaust by painting their ethnic majority as the victims rather than the Jews or Roma people.Kónczal, Kornelia, and Moses, A.

Type !! Rhetoric |- ! Common | * They say the Nazis "did not use Extermination camp or Gas chamber to kill Jews". * Holocaust deniers say the Nazi regime was "only trying to Deportation Jews, not to kill all of them". They say there was "no official Nazi policy to kill Jews", and that "no Nazi leader ever gave an order to kill all of the Jews".Mathis, Andrew E. ''Holocaust Denial, a Definition'', The Holocaust History Project, July 2, 2004, Retrieved 6 March 2013 * History experts agree that the Nazis killed at least 6,000,000 Jews during the Holocaust.Mathis, Andrew E. [http://www.holocaust-history.org/denial/abc-clio/ ''Holocaust Denial, a definition''] , The Holocaust History Project, July 2, 2004, Retrieved 6 March 2013 Holocaust deniers say that far fewer Jews actually died. They also claim that many of these victims died of Disease, like typhus, instead of being Murder by the Nazis.Michael Shermer & Alex Grobman. ''Denying History: : who says the Holocaust never happened and why do they say it?'', University of California Press, 2000, , p. 106 * They say that evidence about the Holocaust is fake. * They say there are errors and differences in stories told by Holocaust survivors and so the stories cannot be believed. |- ! Other | * They say the allies treated enemy prisoner of war just as badly as the Nazis treated the Jews. * They say that after being taken prisoner, many Nazis gave confessions about having committed War crime. Holocaust deniers say these people said things that were not true because they were Torture. * They say that during World War II, "the Allies of World War II made up fake stories about the Holocaust to make Germans look evil" * Jews and the Allies "spread these fake stories as part of a bigger plan" to create a Jewish homeland in Palestine * Jews continue to spread these stories to get sympathy and to get support for the state of Israel. |- |} ==Tactics== ==Just Asking Questions== Just Asking Questions (JAQ) is a pseudoskeptical tactic often employed by Holocaust deniers to promote lies about the Holocaust by phrasing them as questions. ===Sealioning=== As a similar concept to JAQ, sealioning refers to the act of repeating the same questions that have already been answered while faking ignorance and politeness. * * * It is also a common tactic among Holocaust deniers on Internet forum and Social network service. * * * * * ===Doubting Holocaust uniqueness=== Some well-educated antisemites are more skillful at promoting Holocaust denial. * * * * * They do not deny that the Holocaust happened, but they cast doubt on the Holocaust's nature, ignore the historical context leading up to the Holocaust, and abusively compare the Holocaust to other historical events. They do this to whitewash the Holocaust and Dehumanization Holocaust victims so as to Whitewashing Nazi antisemitism and justify the mass murder of Jews. Such behavior is rejected by mainstream historians, including Emil Fackenheim, Yehuda Bauer, Deborah Lipstadt and Daniel Goldhagen. Some of them also accuse Jews of "owning the Holocaust" or "extorting compensation from European governments", and rewrite the Holocaust's history to Exaggeration Jewish collaboration with Nazi Germans so as to blame Jews for their own suffering. * * * These false claims are common on social media, especially Reddit#Controversies. ==Rebuttal== File:Jewish prisoners forced to work for a Sonderkommando 1005 unit pose next to a bone crushing machine in the Janowska concentration camp.jpg destroy other Holocaust victims' Carcass.]] Historians agree that the Holocaust happened and that Holocaust deniers use bad research, get things wrong, and sometimes make facts up to support their claims. Many things together prove that the Holocaust did happen: {| ! Type !! Details |- | '''Written documents''' | Like Legislation, newspaper articles, speeches made by Nazi leaders, and Confession from Nazi Prisoner of war. The Nazis kept careful records, and many of them still exist. Even during World War II, many Germans knew about the Holocaust, and some tried to help save Holocaust victims. |- | '''Eyewitness testimony''' | From those who witnessed Nazi war crimes. That includes Holocaust survivors, like people who survived the Nazi concentration camp. There is specific testimony about the gas chambers from Jewish ''Sonderkommando'' (concentration camp inmates who helped load bodies from the Gas chamber to the Crematorium because this gave them a chance to survive). It also includes the word of Nazi leaders, Nazi concentration camp guards, and Allied Powers soldiers who discovered the camps. |- | '''Camps''' | Pieces of Nazi concentration camps, Extermination camp, and Forced labor still exist. |- | '''Other evidence''' | Including population statistics. |- |} ==Holocaust deniers== Holocaust deniers usually call themselves ''Holocaust revisionists'' to make themselves look good.Lipstadt, Deborah, ''Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory'', Penguin, 1993, , p. 25 Their usual claim is that the Holocaust is "a hoax made up by Jewish people Conspiracy."Mathis, Andrew E.

''Denying History: : who says the Holocaust never happened and why do they say it?'', University of California Press, 2000, , p. 106 It is a crime to deny the Holocaust in Israel and in many Europe countries, especially in Germany.
