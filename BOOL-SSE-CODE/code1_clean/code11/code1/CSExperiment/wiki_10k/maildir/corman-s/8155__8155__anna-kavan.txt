Kavan wrote stories before using the name Anna Kavan. During this time, she wrote six novels. They are very different from her other novels. When she changed her pen name, she started writing Experimental design novels. This change focused on dreams and addiction.Anaïs Nin, The Novel of the Future published by Mcmillan, 1968. ''I Am Lazarus'' is a collection of short stories. The stories are about mental illness and war-related Post-traumatic stress disorder. Kavan travelled a lot during the World War II. She was in New Zealand for 22 months. Because New Zealand is close to Antarctica, she was inspired to write ''Ice''.David Callard, The Case of Anna Kavan, biography published by Peter Owen, 1992. == References == Category:1901 births Category:1968 deaths Category:English novelists
