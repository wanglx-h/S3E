Subject: Region
'''Region''' is a Geography term used in many ways in the different types of geography. In general, a region is a medium-scale area of land or water. It is smaller than the whole area of something (which could be, for example, the earth, a nation, a mountain range, and so on). A climate zone is one kind of region. A region is larger than a specific wikt:location. It may be seen as a wikt:collect of smaller things (as in "the New England U.S. state") or as one part of a larger whole (as in "the New England region of the United States"). In some countries a region is a unit of local government. Category:Regions
