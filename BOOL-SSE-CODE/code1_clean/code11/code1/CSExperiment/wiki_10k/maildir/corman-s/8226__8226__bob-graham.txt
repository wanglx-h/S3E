His career started with being a state representative (Representative 1966-1969, and Senator 1971-1979). == Career == === Early career === In 1978 he was elected Governor of Florida. His Lt. Governor was Wayne Mixson. Graham was reelected in 1982, when he won 65% over a United States Republican Party candidate, Skip Bafalis. He was a popular Governor.
