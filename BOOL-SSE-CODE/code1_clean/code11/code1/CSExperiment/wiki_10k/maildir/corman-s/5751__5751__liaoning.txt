'''Liaoning''' is a northeastern province of the People's Republic of China. The capital city of Liaoning province is Shenyang. From 1931 to 1945 Japan ruled Liaoning as part of Manchukuo. It is the southernmost province of Manchuria (the three northeastern most provinces of China), which together, along with the "Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region", form the entire northeastern part of China. Liaoning is bordered on the northeast by Jilin province, and has a coastline along the Yellow Sea to the southeast. Hebei province and Beijing lie to the southwest. The Yalu River marks the border with North Korea. Dalian is a major port city at the southern tip of the Liaodong Peninsula which juts about 100km south into the Yellow Sea. ==Other websites== *[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/transcoded/e/e8/Zh-Liaoning.ogg/Zh-Liaoning.ogg.mp3 How to (say or) pronounce, Liaoning].
