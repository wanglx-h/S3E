Subject: Symptom
'''Symptoms''' are used in diagnosis. The term is used in medicine, and in other fields such as fault-finding in engineering. In medicine, it refers to things the patient feels or notices. It contrasts with signs, which are changes which a doctor sees in a patient. What a patient feels is wikt:subjective, whereas what a doctor sees is wikt:objective. In diagnosis, all symptoms and signs are brought together to make a hypothesis as to what is going wrong. This might suggest further investigation or treatment. A complete investigation ends with a diagnosis that summarizes all this. * Pain is a symptom, and red color is a sign, of a skin burn. * Feeling sick is a symptom, and vomiting and diarrhea are signs, of food poisoning, cholera and other causes. * Pain in the chest is a symptom, and cyanosis (blue color of skin) is a sign, of heart disease. * Headaches, aching muscles, and nausea are symptoms of influenza. == Similar terms == *'''Symptomatic''': having or showing symptoms. *'''Asymptomatic''': not showing symptoms. **'''Asymptomatic carrier''' has the disease but shows no symptoms.
