[http://www.paulbogdanor.com/left/cambodia/locard.pdf] The Khmer Rouge regime [was] the ultimate 20th century [example] of the totalitarian state. Using sheer violence and terror, a small clique [took] power. [It saw itself as] messiah [with a] mission to bring happiness and prosperity faster than any of its Revolution model and competitors. It came to control every aspect of social and private life. No one was allowed to [hold or] express any form of opposition.File:Khmer_rouge_clothing.jpgOn 17 April 1975, the Khmer Rouge captured Cambodia's capital city, Phnom Penh, and took control of the country.

Most members were Teenager peasant boys. The Khmer Rouge believed the people in Cambodia's cities had been poisoned and wikt:corruption by the ideas of Western world capitalism. They wanted to return Cambodia to "Year Zero," a time when everybody in the country was a Rural area farmer. They thought this would create an Agrarianism Socialism utopia - a perfect, farm-based society without Social class, where people would share everything. They objected to the existence of money, Free market or educated professions (e.g. medicine, engineering, law and teaching). To the Khmer Rouge, being a poor farm worker was the only acceptable lifestyle. They viewed educated people as a fundamental threat to communism. ==Victims== Historians cannot say exactly how many people were killed in the Cambodian genocide.
