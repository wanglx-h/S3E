It is Poland's 6th largest city (population of 500 000 people) and the largest and most important sea port. It has existed since the 10th century and many times played a very important role in Poland's history. In the 19th century it was part of Prussia. This is where Solidarity, the movement which helped end Communist rule in Central Europe and Eastern Europe, came to life. Gdansk has a humid continental climate (''Dfb'' in the Köppen climate classification). == Wikimania == The sixth Wikimania was hosted in this city in 2010. == Related pages == * Golden Gate in Gdańsk == References == == Other websites == Category:Gdańsk Category:Port cities and towns of the Baltic Sea Category:10th-century establishments in Europe
