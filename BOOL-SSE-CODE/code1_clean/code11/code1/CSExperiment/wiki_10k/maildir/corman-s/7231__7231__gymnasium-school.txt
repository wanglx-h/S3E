A '''gymnasium''' is a form of higher education in some European countries, especially Germany. It has the same status as a grammar school. Gymnasiums are also common in Hungary and Austria. Graduating from a gymnasium is considered an accomplishment . Upon completion of the 12th or 13th grade, students undergo examinations called the Abitur. Successful completion of these exams results in graduation from secondary school with a certificate of advanced secondary education. This certification enables students to pursue higher education at a university or a university of applied sciences. Alternatively, they have the option to opt for vocational training and enter the workforce directly. == References == Category:Schools in Germany
