He is the son of Nyx and the twin brother of Hypnos, the god of sleep. Sigmund Freud, a famous psychology, used the word in one of his theory. THANATOS was the god or personified spirit (''daimon'') of non-violent death. His touch was gentle, likened to that of his twin brother Hypnos(Sleep). Violent death was the domain of Thanatos' blood-craving sisters, the Keres, spirits of slaughter and disease. He is often confused with Hades, who is the god of the dead and underworld, not death itself. Once when he was sent to fetch Alkestis (Alcestis) to the underworld, he was driven off by Herakles in a fight. Another time he was captured by the criminal Sisyphos (Sisyphus) who trapped him in a sack so as to avoid death. Thanatos is also a reference to Thanos in the Marvel movie "End Game".
