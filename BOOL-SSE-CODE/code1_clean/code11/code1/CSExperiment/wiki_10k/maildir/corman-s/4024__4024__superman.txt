He was created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster in 1932, while they were still in high school. He first appeared in ''Action Comics'' issue #1 in 1938. Later, he appeared in movies, television programme, cartoons, advertisement, Video game, and radio shows. Superman is one of the most popular superheroes and he also appears in American comic books published by DC Comics. His name is '''Clark Kent''' in the comics. As a superhero he does not want to kill anyone. But he was forced to kill his nemesis General Zod as he was about to kill people. Several actors have played Superman in motion pictures and TV series including Bud Collyer, Kirk Alyn, George Reeves, Christopher Reeve, Dean Cain, Tim Daly, Tom Welling, Brandon Routh, Henry Cavill, Tyler Hoechlin and David Corenswet. == Superman's real life origins == Mr. Siegel imagined an evil villain who read minds and dreamed of conquering the world. He went by the name of the Superman. In the 1930s, Hitler, the infamous nazi villain from real life, was talking about getting rid of the Jews and communists. This was because he believed that Germans he called Aryans were supermen. Mr. Siegel, who was Jewish, found this disgusting. But one night, Mr. Siegel tossed and turned in his bed, and had a horrible time getting to sleep. When he awoke, Superman became the superman we know today, and the evil version disappeared. ==Story== Superman was born on a planet called Krypton (comics). His name was '''Kal-El'''. When his father, Jor-El, found out that their planet was going to explosion, Jor-El sent his baby son to Earth in a spacecraft to save him. Kal-El was found and adoption by Jonathan and Martha Kent. They named him '''Clark Kent'''. The Kents raised him as their own son in a town called Smallville (comics) in the United States. (There is a television series called ''Smallville'' about his time growing up there) As he grows up, Clark finds out that he has special powers. He is almost Invincibility (most things cannot hurt him). He is strong enough to lift almost anything and he can fly. Superman can also run and move faster than a bullet. He has X-ray vision (he can see through walls, he is not able to see through lead), and heat vision (shooting heat from his eyes). He can freeze things with his frost breath and his super-breath (which allows him to blow super hard). He decides to use his special powers to fight crime and save people in danger. He wears a blue and red costume and cape to keep his alter ego (his real name) a secret. He saves the entire world many times. Superman moves to a city called Metropolis (comics), and becomes a journalist for the Daily Planet, a newspaper. He falls in love with another reporter, Lois Lane. His weaknesses are radioactivity Rock (geology) from his home planet that are called "kryptonite"; and magic. Sometimes his enemies use it to hurt him. Diffferent Kryptoinites have different effects on him, Blue Kryptonite makes people able to control him using hypnosis, green weakens his powers and slowly kills him, black makes him evil, and red has many different effects on him (each piece of red kryptonite affects him differently). There is also gold, white, and jewel kryptonite. Some of Superman's enemies use magic to hurt him. ==Affiliations== ===Enemies=== His most well known arch enemy is a bald (hairless), evil genius named Lex Luthor. He has other deadly enemies too. Bizarro (DC Comics) is a failed duplicate of Superman. Darkseid is a very powerful enemy, and the ruler of the planet Apokolips. Doomsday (comics) is regarded as the first villain to kill Superman in physical combat, but he is later revived. Another enemy includes General Zod who comes from the same planet as Superman. ===Teams=== Superman also founded the Justice League of America alongside Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Green Lantern, The Flash, Hawkgirl, Hawkman, and Martian Manhunter. ==TV series== ===Live-action=== Several live-action television shows have focused on Superman: *George Reeves played Superman in ''Adventures of Superman'', which ran from 1952 to 1958.
