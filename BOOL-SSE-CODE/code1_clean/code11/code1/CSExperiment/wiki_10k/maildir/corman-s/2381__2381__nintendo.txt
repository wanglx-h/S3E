The Famicom, Nintendo's second console, was first only released in Japan. It was later released in some other areas, such as North America and Europe. When they released it in there, its name was changed to the Nintendo Entertainment System, or NES for short. They also released some popular stand-alone video games, with names like the arcade game ''Donkey Kong'', and NES games ''Super Mario Bros.'', ''Duck Hunt'', and ''The Legend of Zelda''. Later, the company made hand-held game consoles such as the Game Boy, the Nintendo DS, and the ''Nintendo 3DS'', while continuing to make more home consoles such as the Nintendo 64, Nintendo GameCube, Wii, Wii U, and Nintendo Switch.
