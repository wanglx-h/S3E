This is believed to help people be more healthy though it causes stress on the body by overheating. Today many country and groups of people have different ways of heating and using a sauna. The temperature is often 80°Celsius in Finland saunas. The heat can be more than 100°C. Finnish and Swedish saunas have lower humidity (the air is less wet) to make this high heat comfortable. The Turkey hammam has a high humidity (the air is more wet) and a lower temperature. Today saunas can often be found at hotels and places for sports and exercise.
