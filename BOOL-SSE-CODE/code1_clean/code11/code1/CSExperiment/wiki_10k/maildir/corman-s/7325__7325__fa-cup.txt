It is played between teams in the England league system. It is organized by the Football Association. The winner of the FA Cup qualifies for the next season's UEFA Europa League. If the winner of the FA Cup has already qualified for a European competition, then the Europa League place goes to 6th or 7th place, depending on who won the Football League Cup. The FA Cup semi-finals and final is held at Wembley Stadium. The FA Cup is the oldest football competition in the world and first took place in 1871. The current holders are Manchester United F.C. It is United's 13th FA Cup, one behind Arsenal's record of 14. ==Winners and finalists== ===Results by team=== Since its establishment, the FA Cup has been won by 43 different teams.
