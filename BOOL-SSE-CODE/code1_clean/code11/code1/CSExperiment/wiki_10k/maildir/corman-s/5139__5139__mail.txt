The postal system is a wikt:system where writing wikt:documents and small to medium packages are sent (delivered) to places around the earth. Anything sent through the postal system is called mail or '''post'''. A postal wikt:service can be private or public. Governments often make rules about private postal delivery systems. Since the early 19th century, most national postal systems have been controlled entirely by governments. The governments make people pay a fee to send something. This fee is usually in the form of stamps. Some governments only let private postal services deliver parcel (non-mail) packages. Postal systems often do things other than sending letters. In some country, the postal system is also in charge of telephone and telegraph systems. The postal systems in other countries can help people apply for government papers such as passports and driver's licenses. Many places the post offices also work like banks. This is so that people can take out money or pay bills at a nearby post office, instead of travelling to a big bank in the nearest town. People drop letters in a post box to be collected and delivered by the post office. == Related pages == * * Clapper Post * Electronic mail * Envelope * Letter (paper) * Letter box * Postcard * Telegram Category:Postal services
