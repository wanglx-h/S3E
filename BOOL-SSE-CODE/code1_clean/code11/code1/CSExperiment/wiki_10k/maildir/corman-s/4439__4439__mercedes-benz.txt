The company was once known as '''Daimler-Benz''' and is still sometimes called just "Mercedes." Mercedes-Benz is one of the world's oldest car maker and the cars they make are expensive. The symbol of Mercedes-Benz is very famous. It is a three-pointed star inside of a circle and was designed by one of the men who started the company, Gottlieb Daimler. The three points of the star stand for land, air and sea because Daimler's engines were used not only in cars and trucks but in airplanes and boats. The symbol was first used in 1909.
