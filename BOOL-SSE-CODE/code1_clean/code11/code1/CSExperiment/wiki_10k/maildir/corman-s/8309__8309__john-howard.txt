John Howard is the second longest serving prime minister of Australia after Robert Menzies. John Howard is a member of the Liberal Party (Australia). John Howard was a lawyer before he became a politician. He was in parliament from 1974 until 2007. From 1977 to 1983 he was the Treasurer in Malcolm Fraser's government. Malcolm Fraser lost the 1987 election to Bob Hawke. On 24 November 2007, John Howard lost to Kevin Rudd and his parliamentary seat to Maxine McKew. He became the second prime minister to lose a parliamentary seat after Stanley Bruce in 1929. ==Early life== File:John Howard boy.jpg John Howard is the fourth son of Mona (''nee'' Kell) and Lyall Howard. His parents were married in 1925. His eldest brother Stanley was born in 1926, followed by Walter in 1929, and Robert (Bob) in 1936. Lyall Howard was an admirer of Winston Churchill, and a sympathiser with the New Guard. Howard's ancestors were English, Scottish and Irish.Peter Van Onselen, Wayne Errington, John Winston Howard: The Definitive Biography, p. 2-4 Howard was born and raised in the Sydney suburb of Earlwood, New South Wales, in a Methodist family. His mother had been an office worker until her marriage. His father and his paternal grandfather, Walter Howard, were both veterans of the First Australian Imperial Force in World War I. They also ran two Dulwich Hill, New South Wales petrol stations. Howard worked there as a boy. Howard suffered from a hearing impairment in his youth. It ruled out the chances of him becoming a barrister as a likely career from his mind. To this day, John wears a hearing aid. ==Prime Minister (1996-2007)== ===First term=== File:HowardCohen97.jpg William Cohen in 1997.]] One of Howard's first initiatives was to unite the state governments of Australia to place restrictions on gun ownership in Australia. This move came after the Port Arthur massacre in Tasmania in 1996, where 35 people were killed and a further 23 injured at the hands of a gunman. In 1998, Howard and his Treasurer, Peter Costello took a big tax reform (the Goods and Services Tax (Australia)) to the election and won. ===Second term=== In 1999 John Howard's government held a referendum on whether Australia should become a republic and have a President instead of a Queen. However, John Howard did not support the referendum and urged people to vote no. The Australian Labor Party opposition led by Kim Beazley criticised John Howard's handling of the 1998 Australian Waterfront Dispute. In 1999, Howard led a United Nations force into East Timor (International Force for East Timor), to help them set up an independent democracy. ===Third term=== File:Howard-Powell 2003.jpg After the September 11 attacks, John Howard was involved in world issues. He was close with George W. Bush who was the leader of the United States. George Bush called John Howard a "key ally". John Howard sent SAS troops to Afghanistan and Iraq to support the United States, and signed a free trade agreement with the United States. Despite this alliance, Australia remained fairly neutral on Israel and Palestine. Like before Howard, Australian trade with Asia got bigger while John Howard was leader. He invited the Chinese leader Hu Jintao to speak to the Australian Parliament for the first time. After the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, John Howard called the President of Indonesia and offered a billion dollars to help. John Howard increased immigration a lot and people came to Australia from all over the world, but he tried to stop boats of people coming without asking for visas first. ===Fourth term=== File:Vladimir Putin with John Howard-1.jpg at the 2007 APEC sumit]] In 2005, he made it easier for bosses to get rid of workers by introducing the controversial WorkChoices industrial legislation introduced by his Workplace Relations Minister Kevin Andrews (Australian politician). This upset people and the Labor Party became more popular. On 24 November 2007, Kevin Rudd won an election and John Howard stopped being Prime Minister. John Howard also lost his seat in the Parliament to the Labor Party candidate Maxine McKew, a former Australian Broadcasting Corporation TV journalist. ==References== Category:1939 births Category:Living people Category:Australian Anglicans Category:Australian lawyers Category:Commonwealth Chairpersons-in-Office Category:Leaders of the Opposition (Australia) Category:Liberal Party of Australia politicians Category:Monarchists Category:Politicians from Sydney Category:Prime ministers of Australia Category:Treasurers of Australia Category:University of Sydney alumni
