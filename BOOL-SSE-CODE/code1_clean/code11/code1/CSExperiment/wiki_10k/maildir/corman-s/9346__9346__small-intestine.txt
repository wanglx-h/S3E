File:Illu small intestine.jpg The '''small intestine''' is between the stomach and the large intestine, and is where most of the digestion and absorption happen.The main function of the small intestine is the absorption of nutrients and minerals from food. [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/275485/human-body] In humans over five years old, the small intestine is about 7.5 meters long. However, while it is long in length, it is short in diameter which is why it is dubbed the 'small intestine'. The small intestine has three regions: the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum. *The duodenum: receives bile and juice from the pancreas, and is where most digestion in the small intestine takes place. Secretion limit, or Base (chemistry), the stomach acidity, and enzymes help to digest the food. *The jejunum: the products of digestion (Sugar, amino acids, and fatty acids) are Absorption into the Circulatory system here. *The ileum: absorbs vitamin B12, bile salts, and any other products of digestion that were not absorbed by the jejunum. ==References== Category:Anatomy of the digestive system
