Fifty million years ago, there were no horses as we know them now. Of the earliest fossil horse, the North American one is called ''Eohippus'', and the Eurasian one is called ''Hyracotherium''. Both were small animals: ''Eohippus'' was the larger of the two at twice the size of a terrier dog. Many changes occurred between those little animals and today's horses. These changes are best explained as adaptations. To its changing ecological niche, from a small forest-dweller eating nuts and fruit to a more significant forest browser eating leaves and small branches. Finally, the modern horse is a grazer on open grassland, with different teeth, legs for running, and a much larger size. Significant changes happened in the mid-Miocene when the climate cooled and grassland replaced forests. This change continued, and several groups of mammals changed from browsers to grazers. == Horses and humans == File:Farmer plowing.jpg Horses have been domesticated for at least 5000 years. Humans have used them in many different ways for travel, work, food, pleasure and show. Cavalry horses were used in war until the mid-20th century. They are used for riding and transport.

Other female equines are also sometimes called mares. Before the mare's third birthday, the mare is called a filly. When a mare wants to mate, the mare is called ''in heat''.
