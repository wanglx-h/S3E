'''Bernie Little''' (''born'' in McComb, Ohio on circa 1926 - ''died'' April 25, 2003) was the most successful owner in Unlimited Hydroplane racing history. His ''Miss Budweiser'' team won 134 of the 354 hydroplane races they entered. They won the high points championship 22 years in 40 years of competition, and the Gold Cup 14 times. == Racing career == Little's team is also known for making an enclosed driver's seat to improve driver safety, after driver Dean Chenoweth was killed in a crash during a race in 1982. His team employed some of the biggest names in their field, including designer Ron Jones, and driver Chip Hanauer who won more Gold Cup races than any other driver. He is second only to Bill Muncey in total races won. == Awards and recognition == Little has been inducted into the Unlimited Hydroplane Hall of Fame, the Florida Sports Hall of Fame, and the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America. Chenoweth, Hanauer, and another driver for Little, Tom D'Eath, are also in the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America. == References == *[http://www.abrahydroplanes.com/index.cfm?page=BERNIE-LITTLE-REMEMBERED Bernie Little obituary] - from the American Boat Racing Association website *[http://www.lesliefield.com/other_history/bernie_little__king_of_boats.htm Bernie Little - King of Boats] - by Fred Farley - APBA Unlimited Historian Category:1926 births Category:2003 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Ohio
