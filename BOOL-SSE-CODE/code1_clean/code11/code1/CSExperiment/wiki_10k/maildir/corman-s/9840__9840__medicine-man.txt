Subject: Medicine man
A '''medicine man''' is a traditional Native American healer. Healing was only part of their function. Another part of their role was as guardian of their belief system, and their rituals. A very similar role was played in many other mesolithic and neolithic Society, such as pre-modern Africa and New Guinea.Huet, Michel & Savary, Claude 1995. ''Africa dances''.

A term such as shaman or witch doctor reflects the supernatural element in such roles. == References == Category:Native Americans Category:Religious people Category:Healthcare
