''Rumble in the Bronx'', which was his ultimate breakthrough United States movie. He subjected his already aging body to several leaps and falls. He had a broken ankle. His two worst injuries occurred during the making of ''Armour of God'' and ''Police Story''. Footage was shown over the credits with a subdued and bloodied Chan in a vertebral column injury stretcher. A tree branch in which he was to swing off had snapped just when he jumped upon and over it. Chan fell 10 meters onto the rocky ground. In ''Police Story'', Chan was doing a stunt where he fell about 5 to 6 Storey through a series of window canopy. Instead of landing on his feet, Chan fell in a head-down position. His arms became caught in the material of the last canopy. He landed on his head first and his head was then forced on to the side as he could not break his fall with his arms. While the ''Police Story'' fall looked worse, Chan said that the ''Armour of God'' fall was the closest he has come to death while filming. == Personal life == Chan stands at a height of 167 cm.
