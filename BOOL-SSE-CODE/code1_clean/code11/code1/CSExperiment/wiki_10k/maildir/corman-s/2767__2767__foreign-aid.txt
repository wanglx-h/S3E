Some aid is for supporting economic development and help those in need, especially in places where wealthy countries and companies often shape trade, rules, and spread of money to their own benefit. Sometimes foreign aid is given to protect the donor country’s own interests by influencing politics or supporting their own Business abroad. Experts say that helping people meet their basic needs through aid can reduce the chances of them joining dangerous groups or being forced to flee their homes. This aid not only comes from a country's government, but sometimes a country's ordinary people also donate.
