File:Albert Coady Wedemeyer.gif General '''Albert Coady Wedemeyer''' (18971989) was an United States Army officer during World War II. Wedemeyer was born in Omaha, Nebraska on July 9, 1897. He studied at the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York and graduated in 1919. After the start of World War II, he was made a temporary Lieutenant Colonel in 1941. Between 1941 and 1943, he served as a staff officer in the war-plans division of the U.S. War Department. He was the chief author of the 1941 Victory Program which advocated the defeat of the Nazi Germany armies in Europe. When the U.S. entered the war this plan was adopted and expanded. He helped plan the Normandy invasion. In 1943, Wedemeyer was made Chief of Staff to House of Windsor, the supreme Allies of World War II commander of the South East Asia Command (SEAC) in the South-East Asian Theatre of World War II. Between 1944 and 1946, he was Chief of staff to General Chiang Kai-shek and commander of U.S. forces in China under the command SEAC. The China Burma India Theater of World War II assigned to Joseph Stilwell was split in two with command of the BurmaIndia theatre going to General Daniel Isom Sultan. Wedemeyer had been commander of the China Burma India Theater of World War II (USFCT) in 19441945. He had an intimate knowledge of the Allied airlift from India over the Himalayas into China. This airlift was both to supply the Nationalist Chinese Army and the U.S. Twentieth Air Force engaged on Operation Matterhorn. In 1948, as the Army Chief of Plans and Operations, Wedemeyer supported Lucius D. Clay's intention to create an airbridge during the Berlin Crisis. His expertise in this area was considerable as he had been U.S. Army theater commander in China during World War II and had been supplied by air over the mountains from India by army transport planes. This earlier operation had been commanded by Lieutenant General William H. Tunner, who was later named to head the Berlin Airlift operation. Wedemeyer retired in 1951. He was promoted to general in 1954. He died December 17, 1989 in Fort Belvoir, Virginia. His son Albert Dunbar Wedemeyer was a captain in the U.S. army and a Central Intelligence Agency operative. == Other websites == * [http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/acwede.htm Arlington Cemetery biography] * [http://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/BERLIN_A/BAPI_127.HTM Photo] * [http://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/BERLIN_A/PAGE_11.HTM Berlin Airlift] * [http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article?eu=407779 Britannica biography] * [http://usinfo.org/sino/fact_findaing_China.pdf Fact Finding Mission to China: Report by Wedemeyer] (September 19, 1947) Category:American people of World War II Category:People from Omaha, Nebraska Category:1897 births Category:1989 deaths Category:Military people from Nebraska
