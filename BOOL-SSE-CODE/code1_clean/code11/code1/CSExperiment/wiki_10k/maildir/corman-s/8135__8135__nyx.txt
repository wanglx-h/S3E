File:BnF MS Gr139 folio 435 verso - detail - Nyx.jpg (a manuscript from the 10th century)]] '''Nyx''' was the goddess of the wikt:night in Greek mythology. She came out of Chaos (mythology). Her Roman mythology equivalent was '''Nox'''. == Hesiod's Theogony == In his theogony (How the gods came to be), Hesiod tells: ''Night is born of Chaos (mythology); her offspring are many, and telling. With Erebus, Night gives birth to the following deities:'' * Aether (mythology) ("atmosphere") and Hemera ("day"). Later, on her own, Night gives birth to * Momus "blame" * Ponos "toil" * Moros "fate" * Thanatos "death" * Hypnos "sleep", * the Oneiroi "the tribe of dreams" * the Hesperides * the Keres (mythology) and Fates * Nemesis (mythology) "retribution" * Apate "deception" * Philotes (mythology) "friendship" * Geras "age", * and Eris "strife". In his description of Tartarus, Hesiod says further that Hemera "day", who is now Night's sister rather than daughter, left Tartarus just as Nyx entered it; when Hemera returned, Nyx left. This mirrors the portrayal of Ratri "night" in the Rig-Veda, where she works in close cooperation but also tension with her sister Ushas "dawn".File:William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1825-1905) - La Nuit (1883).jpg]] == Children == * Only hers: **Hypnos, the god of sleep. ** Thanatos, the god of death. ** Apate, the god of deception. ** Eris, the god of strife. ** Geras, the god of Ageing. ** Momus, the god of blame. ** Moros, the god of fate. ** Philotes, the god of friendship. ** Ponus, the god of toil. ** [https://www.jagexp.com/forum/the-e-type-xk-e-forum.4/reopus-sng-barrett-ignition-upgrade-72-s3.13634/ Reopus], the god of negativity ==Related pages== * Nox - Etruscan mythology version of Nyx. == References == Category:Greek gods and goddesses Category:Gods and goddesses of the underworld
