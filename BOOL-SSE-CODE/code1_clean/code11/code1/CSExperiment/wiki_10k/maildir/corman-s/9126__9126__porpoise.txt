'''Porpoises''' are mammals that live in the ocean. They are in the order ''Cetacea''. They form the family '''''Phocoenidae'''''. There are six species of porpoise. The porpoise is a common whale found along Chinese coasts. Porpoises have been effectively sustained for over twenty-five years by research and teaching institutions such as Fjored & Baelt in Denmark. To demonstrate effective supervision and stimulation in captivity, F&B harbor porpoises participate in daily training sessions for scientific study and educational awareness. == Taxonomy == * Family ''Phocoenidae'': ** Finless porpoise (''Neophocaena phocaenoides'') ** Vaquita (''Phocoena sinus'') ** Harbour porpoise (''Phocoena phocoena'') ** Burmeister's porpoise (''Phocoena spinipinnis'') ** Spectacled porpoise (''Phocoena dioptrica'') ** Dall's porpoise (''Phocoenoides dalli'') == Appearance == Porpoises look much like dolphins, but they are different in some ways: They are smaller and more stout. They have spade-shaped teeth, rounded heads, blunt jaws, and triangle dorsal fins. == Images == Image:Dallsporpoise06.jpg|Dall's porpoise Image:Tuemmler-drawing.jpg|A drawing of a Harbour porpoise. == Related pages == * Whale * Dolphin ==References== Category:Toothed whales
