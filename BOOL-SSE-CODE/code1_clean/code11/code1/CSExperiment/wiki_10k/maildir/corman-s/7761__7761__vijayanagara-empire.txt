From 1336 and afterwards, it was in the Deccan, in the peninsula and in South India. It was founded by Harihara (Hakka) and his brother Bukka. The empire is named after its capital city Vijayanagara, now Hampi in modern Karnataka, India. It began in 1336 and ended in 1660, though in its last century it began losing its power. Stories of the empire's creation and history are not certain, though tales of the empire's wealth and power were described by European travellers such as the Portuguese travelers Domingo Paes and Nuniz, and the Venetian traveler Niccolò Da Conti. == Dynasties and kings == The Empire was ruled by four different dynasties from 1336 CE to 1646 CE and maintained control over most of South India during most of its history. === Sangama dynasty (1336–1485) === {| style="width:100%;" class="wikitable" ! style="background:#f0dc88; width:5%;"|Serial no. ! style="background:#f0dc88; width:17%;"| Regnal names ! style="background:#f0dc88; width:17%;"| Reign |- |1 |Harihara I (Founder) |18 April 1336 20 November 1356 |- |2 |Bukka Raya I |1356–1377 |- |3 |Harihara II |21 June 1377 1404 |- |4 |Virupaksha Raya |1404–1405 |- |5 |Bukka Raya II |27 July 1404 August/November 1406 |- |6 |Deva Raya |5 November 1406 25 February 1423 |- |7 |Ramachandra Raya |4 April 1423 1423 |- |8 |Vira Vijaya Bukka Raya |1422–1424 |- |9 |Deva Raya II |10 February 1423 May 1446 |- |10 |Mallikarjuna Raya |1446 14 July 1465 |- |11 |Virupaksha Raya II |1465–1485 |- |12 |Praudha Raya |1485 |- |} === Saluva dynasty (1485–1505) === {| style="width:100%;" class="wikitable" ! style="background:#f0dc88; width:5%;"|Serial no. ! style="background:#f0dc88; width:17%;"| Regnal names ! style="background:#f0dc88; width:17%;"| Reign |- |13 |Saluva Narasimha Deva Raya |1485–1491 |- |14 |Thimma Bhupala |1491 |- |15 |Narasimha Raya II |1491–1505 |- |} === Tuluva dynasty (1491–1570) === {| style="width:100%;" class="wikitable" ! style="background:#f0dc88; width:5%;"|Serial no. ! style="background:#f0dc88; width:17%;"| Regnal names ! style="background:#f0dc88; width:17%;"| Reign |- |16 |Tuluva Narasa Nayaka |1491–1503 |- |17 |Viranarasimha Raya |1503 26 July 1509 |- |18 |Krishnadevaraya |26 July 1509 17 October 1529 |- |19 |Achyuta Deva Raya |30 November 1529 1542 |- |20 |Venkata I |1542 |- |21 |Sadasiva Raya |1542–1570 |- |} === Aravidu dynasty (1542–1646) === {| style="width:100%;" class="wikitable" ! style="background:#f0dc88; width:5%;"|Serial no. ! style="background:#f0dc88; width:17%;"| Regnal names ! style="background:#f0dc88; width:17%;"| Reign |- |22 |Aliya Rama Raya |1542 23 January 1565 |- |23 |Tirumala Deva Raya |1565–1572 |- |24 |Sriranga Deva Raya |1572–1586 |- |25 |Venkatapati Deva Raya |1586–1614 |- |26 |Sriranga II |1614 |- |27 |Rama Deva Raya |1617–1632 |- |28 |Peda Venkata Raya |1632–1642 |- |29 |Sriranga III (Last Emperor) |1642–1646/1678 |- |} == References == ==Other websites== * [http://www.ourkarnataka.com/history.htm History of Karnataka - Mr. Arthikaje] * [http://inscriptions.whatisindia.com Indian Inscriptions - Archeological Survery Of India] * [http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/gutbook/lookup?num=3310 A Forgotten Empire: Vijayanagar: A Contribution to the History of India] * http://freeindia.org/biographies/greatlkings/hakkabukka/index.htm(Biography of Hakka and Bukka.) * [http://www.kamat.com/kalranga/andhra/vnagar.htm Vijayanagar Empire, Dr. Jyotsna Kamat] * [http://www.hampionline.com/ Hampi - History and Tourism] Category:History of India Category:Former empires Category:1330s establishments Category:1660s disestablishments Category:14th-century establishments in India Category:Disestablishments in India Category:Former countries in South Asia
