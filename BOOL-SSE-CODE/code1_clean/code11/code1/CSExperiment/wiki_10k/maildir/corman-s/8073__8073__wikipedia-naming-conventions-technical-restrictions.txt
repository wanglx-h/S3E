Subject: Wikipedia:Naming conventions (technical restrictions)
Some page titles cannot be named correctly due to things the MediaWiki software can't do. For example, a character in the name can't be used in page titles. The following characters cannot be used in page titles: # [ ] { } |. Where you want to draw readers' :wikt:attention to this, add something like this before the first paragraph of the article: '''''' Which will produce the text: : For a list of articles that are marked with this template, see Special:Whatlinkshere/Template:Wrongtitle. ==Lowercase== To make the first letter lowercase (small), put this before the first paragraph: :'''''' Which will fix the title, like in iTunes. For a list of articles that are marked with this template, see Special:Whatlinkshere/Template:Lowercase.
