Subject: Bow (weapon)
:''This article is about the weapon. For other meanings, see '''Bow (disambiguation)'''.'' File:Equipement.archer.2.png A '''bow''' is a weapon used to shoot arrows. It is used in hunting, sport, and a long time ago, war. Using a bow is called archery. A person who uses a bow is an '''archer''' and a person who makes bows is a '''bowyer'''. A bow is a long curved stick and a string which is tied to both ends. Ancient bows were made of natural materials like wood or bone and sinew, but today they are often made of plastic and similar materials. To shoot a bow, the arrow is put on the bow, with one end to the string, which is pulled back. When the string is let loose, it throws the arrow forwards. There are many different types of bows, for example the longbow or the automatic crossbow and the compound bow. There are many different ways that people protect themselves from arrow attacks. The Roman Army, for instance, had the testudo formate, or tortoise formation. They first made the shields lock into a somewhat tortoise like formation, which provide a shell that was make out of shields. The arrows would eventually run out, and the Romans would charge. ==Reading== * Category:Archery Category:Weapons
