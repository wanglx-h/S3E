:''Sometimes '''Sacrament''' can stand for Eucharist'' In Christianity, a '''sacrament''' is a special rite. It is a visible token of the reality of Holy Trinity. ==Sacraments in the Catholic Church== File:The seven Sacrament.jpg The Roman Catholicism knows seven such sacraments. These are *Baptism - usually given shortly after birth, it is meant to forgive original sin. *Confirmation (Christianity) - done when reaching maturity *Eucharist - The body and blood of Jesus Christ is eaten to remember the Last Supper. *Sacrament of marriage *consecrations - the deacon, the priest and bishop. *Penance and remission of sins *Anointing of the Sick - used to be known as Last Rites, given shortly before death ==Protestant views== Following Martin Luther's tradition, many Protestant churches see only Baptism and Lord's Supper as Sacraments. They also have most of the other rites, but do not consider them to be sacraments. ==Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox views== Eastern Orthodox Church and Oriental Orthodox Churches basically have the same views as the Roman Catholic Church. They say however, that many things the church does (as church), can be seen as sacraments, in some way. Category:Sacraments
