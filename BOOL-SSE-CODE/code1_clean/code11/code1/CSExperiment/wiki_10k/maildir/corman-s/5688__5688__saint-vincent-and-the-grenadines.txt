The Caribs inhabited Saint Vincent before the Europeans arrived, and it is possible still to find Carib Artifact (archaeology)s in the island. Christopher Columbus explored in 1498 the main island on Saint Vincent's Day. The Caribs did not allowed Europeans to settle in Saint Vincent until 1719 when some French people came from Martinique and began to grow coffee, tobacco, indigo, cotton and sugar cane with the help of African slaves. In 1763 by the Treaty of Paris (1763), France gave control of Saint Vincent to Britain; France took the island again in 1779, but the British then regained Saint Vincent under the Treaty of Paris (1783). In 1834 slavery was abolished and people from the Portugal island of Madeira and from India came to work as Agriculture workers. In 1871 the group of islands became part of the Windward Islands Colony and in 1956 a member of the Federation of the Windward Islands. In 1958 Saint Vincent joined the Federation of the West Indies and in 1969 it got full internal self-government.
