Bigger than the Lesser Goldfinch, and smaller than the American Goldfinch, with less yellow markings than either. It lives from central California and its southern coast in the United States, to Baja California Peninsula in Mexico. Females have less yellow and do not have the black cap and chin of the males. This bird is named after the American ''ornithologist'' (bird expert), George Newbold Lawrence. ==References== Category:Finches Category:Birds of North America
