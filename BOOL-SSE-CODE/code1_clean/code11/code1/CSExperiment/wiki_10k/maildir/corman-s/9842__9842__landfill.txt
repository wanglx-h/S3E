File:Wysypisko.jpg]] File:WasteFinalDeposited.jpg A '''landfill''' is a place where waste is kept. Waste is usually burial in landfills, but it may first be sorted to remove any Recycling materials. Landfills have a bad odor and look bad, therefore are usually located far away from where people live. Once the waste is crushed into very small pieces, it is buried, but without oxygen, a dangerous gas called methane is created. This process is called anaerobic digestion. In some countries, the methane from landfills is used to generate energy. == Large landfills in the United States == Roosevelt Regional Landfill, Roosevelt, Washington (state).
