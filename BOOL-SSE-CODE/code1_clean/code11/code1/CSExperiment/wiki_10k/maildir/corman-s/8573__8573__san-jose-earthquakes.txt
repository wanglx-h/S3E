In December 2005, they moved to Houston, Texas to become the Houston Dynamo. Failure to secure funding for a new stadium caused the team to move. In July 2007, they were granted an expansion team, which would bring them back in 2008. From 1994 to 1999 they were known as the '''San Jose Clash'''. By agreement between MLS, the Dynamo, and the Earthquakes, the history of the original San Jose franchise belongs to the current Earthquakes. == Name == * 1994-1999 '''San Jose Clash''' * 1999-present '''San Jose Earthquakes''' == League title == * Major League Soccer : 2 ** Major League Soccer 2001, Major League Soccer 2003 == League position == {| class="wikitable" style="text-align:left;" |align="center"|Season||align="center"|League||align="center"|Position |- |Major League Soccer 1996||Major League Soccer||Quarterfinals |- |Major League Soccer 1997||Major League Soccer||5th / West |- |Major League Soccer 1998||Major League Soccer||5th / West |- |Major League Soccer 1999||Major League Soccer||5th / West |- |Major League Soccer 2000||Major League Soccer||4th / West |- |Major League Soccer 2001||Major League Soccer||Champions |- |Major League Soccer 2002||Major League Soccer||Quarterfinals |- |Major League Soccer 2003||Major League Soccer||Champions |- |Major League Soccer 2004||Major League Soccer||Quarterfinals |- |Major League Soccer 2005||Major League Soccer||Quarterfinals |- |Major League Soccer 2008||Major League Soccer||7th / West |} ==References== Category:American soccer teams Category:Sports in San Jose, California Category:Major League Soccer teams Category:1994 establishments in California
