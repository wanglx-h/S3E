File:Sphere wireframe 10deg 3r.svg A '''sphere''' is a round, 3D shape. All Point (geometry)s on the edge of the sphere are at the same distance from the center. The distance from the center is called the radius of the sphere. A real-world sphere is called a ''globe'' if it is large (such as the Earth), and as a ''ball'' if it is small, like an association football. Common things that have the shape of a sphere are basketballs, superballs, and playground balls. The Earth and the Sun are nearly ''spherical'', meaning sphere-shaped. A sphere is the three-dimensional Analogy of a circle. == Calculating measures of a sphere == === Surface area === Using the circumference: A=\frac{c^2}{\pi}=\frac{2c^2}{\tau} Using the diameter: A=\pi d^2=\frac{\tau d^2}{2} Using the radius: A=2\tau r^2=4\pi r^2 Using the volume: A=\sqrt[3]{3\tau V^2}=\sqrt[3]{6\pi V^2} === Circumference === Using the surface area: c=\sqrt{\pi A}=\sqrt{\frac{\tau A}{2}} Using the diameter: c=\pi d=\frac{\tau d}{2} Using the radius: c=\tau r=2\pi r Using the volume: c=\sqrt[3]{6\pi^2 V}=\sqrt[3]{\frac{3\tau^2 V}{2}} === Diameter === Using the surface area: d=\sqrt{\frac A\pi}=\sqrt{\frac{2A}{\tau}} Using the circumference: d=\frac c\pi=\frac{2c}{\tau} Using the radius: d=2r Using the volume: d=\sqrt[3]{\frac{6V}{\pi}}=\sqrt[3]{\frac{12V}{\tau}} === Radius === Using the surface area: r=\sqrt{\frac{A}{2\tau}}=\sqrt{\frac{A}{4\pi}} Using the circumference: r=\frac c\tau=\frac{c}{2\pi} Using the diameter: r=\frac d2 Using the volume: r=\sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{2\tau}}=\sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}} === Volume === Using the surface area: V=\sqrt{\frac{A^3}{18\tau}}=\sqrt{\frac{A^3}{36\pi}} Using the circumference: V=\frac{c^3}{6\pi^2}=\frac{2c^3}{3\tau^2} Using the diameter: V=\frac{\pi d^3}{6}=\frac{\tau d^3}{12} Using the radius: V=\frac{2\tau r^3}{3}=\frac{4\pi r^3}{3} == Equation of a sphere == In Cartesian coordinate system, the equation for a sphere with a center at (x_0,y_0,z_0) is as follows: :(x-x_0)^2+(y-y_0)^2+(z-z_0)^2=r^2 where r is the radius of the sphere. == Related pages == * Circle * Pi * Tau (mathematical constant) Category:Three-dimensional shapes
