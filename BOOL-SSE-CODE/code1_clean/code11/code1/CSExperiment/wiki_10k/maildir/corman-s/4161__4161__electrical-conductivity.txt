'''Electrical conductivity''' is the measure of a material's ability to allow the transport of an electric charge. Its SI is the ''siemens (unit) per metre'', (ampere2second3metre−3kilogram−1) (named after Werner von Siemens) or, more simply, Sm−1. It is the ratio of the electric current density to the electric field strength. It is equivalent to the electrical conductance measured between opposite faces of a 1-metre cube of the material under test. *The symbol for electrical conductivity is '''κ''' (kappa), and also '''σ''' (sigma) or '''γ''' (gamma). Electrical conductance is an electric charge where a material contains movable particles with electric charge (such as electrons), which can carry electricity. When a difference of electrical potential is placed across a conductor, its electrons flow, and an electric current appears. A Electrical conductor such as a metal has high conductivity, and an Insulator (electricity) like glass or a vacuum has low conductivity. A semiconductor has a conductivity that varies widely under different conditions. Electrical conductivity is the reciprocal (or inverse) of electrical resistivity.
