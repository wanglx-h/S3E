It has area of 22,347 square kilometre (8,628 square mile). In traditional Indian geography it falls under the North-east Indian zone. During the days of the British Raj, the Kingdom of Manipur was one of the Princely state. The state is bordered by the Indian states of Nagaland to its north, Mizoram to its south and Assam to its west. Its eastern border is the Indian border with Myanmar. Manipur has a long recorded written history of kings ascended in the main throne of Kangla. The list of these kings can be found in a chronicle known as Cheitharol Kumbaba. '''Cheitharol Kumbaba''', also spelled '''Cheitharon Kumpapa''', is the court chronicle of the kings of Manipur. It recorded the history of the Ancient Manipur from the founding of the Ningthouja dynasty in 33 CE under king Nongda Lairen Pakhangba until the merger of the kingdom with India in 1949 and the subsequent abolition of monarchy. It ends with the last king of Manipur, Bodhchandra. The Cheitharol Kumbaba is probably one of the oldest chronicles of the region and is written on more than 1000 leaves of PuYa in Meetei Mayek, an early Meitei script. == Administration == === Districts of Manipur === District Headquarters #BPR Bishnupur Bishnupur #TBL Thoubal Thoubal #IE Imphal East Porompat #IW Imphal West Lamphelpat #SE Senapati Senapati #UKR Ukhrul Ukhrul #CDL Chandel Chandel #CCP Churachandpur Churachandpur #TML Tamenglong Tamenglong #JBM Jiribam Jiribam #KPI Kangpokpi (Sadar Hills) Kangpokpi #KAK Kakching Kakching #TNL Tengnoupal Tengnoupal #KJ Kamjong Kamjong #NL Noney Noney #PZ Pherzawl Pherzawl == Sports == Manipur became the champion in the three consecutive years of the 2022, 2023 & 2024 Northeast Games. == References == == Other websites == Category:Manipur
