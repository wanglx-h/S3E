Subject: List of dependent territories
'''Dependent areas''' are territory and overseas territory that do not possess full independence or sovereignty as states/country. There are varying degrees and forms of such a dependence. They are commonly distinguished from Administrative division in that they are not considered to be part of the motherland or mainland of the governing state, and in most cases they also represent a different order of separation. A subnational entity typically represents a division of the country proper, while a dependent territory might be an overseas territory that enjoys a greater degree of autonomy. For instance, many of them have a more or less separate legal system from the governing body. The areas separately referred to as ''non-independent'' are territories that are Border dispute, are Military occupation, have a Government-in-exile or have a non-negligible independence movement. == List of dependencies by Commonwealth sovereignty == All these are, as such or as part of a Commonwealth of Nations state in personal union under the same British Monarch. === Australia === * Ashmore and Cartier Islands: territory administered by the Australian Attorney-General's Department * Christmas Island: territory administered by the Australian Attorney-General's Department * Cocos (Keeling) Islands: territory administered from Canberra by the Australian Attorney-General's Department * Coral Sea Islands: territory administered from Canberra by the Australian Attorney-General's Department * Heard Island and McDonald Islands: territory administered from Canberra by the Australian Antarctic Division of the Department the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts * Norfolk Island: territory of Australia; administered from Canberra by the Australian Attorney-General's Department * Australian Antarctic Territory: territory administered from Canberra by the Australian Antarctic Division of the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts === New Zealand === * Cook Islands: self-governing in free association with New Zealand; Cook Islands is fully responsible for internal affairs; New Zealand retains some responsibility for external affairs and defense, in consultation with the Cook Islands.
