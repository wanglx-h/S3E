Subject: Twelve Olympians
The '''Twelve Olympians''' are the most important gods of Greek mythology, who lived atop Mount Olympus (Mytikas peek 2917.727 m). Seventeen gods have been said to have been Olympians, but there were never more than twelve at the same time. Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Demeter, Ares, Hermes, Hephaestus, Aphrodite, Athena, Apollo, and Artemis are always considered to be Olympians. Hestia, Dionysus, and Hades are the gods who have sometimes been Olympians. Thus, it is theorised that Hestia gave up her place to Dionysus because she wanted to live amongst humans however no records of this actually exist The Olympians became the most important gods when Zeus and his brothers and sisters won a war against the Titan (mythology). Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Demeter, Hestia, and Hades are all brothers and sisters. All the other gods are Zeus children and have different mothers. == Gods who are Olympians == * Zeus is the most important god. He is the ruler of Mount Olympus and is the god of the weather.
