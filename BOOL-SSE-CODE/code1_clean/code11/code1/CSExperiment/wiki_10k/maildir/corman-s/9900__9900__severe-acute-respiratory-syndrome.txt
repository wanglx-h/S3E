The disease was caused by the SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV), a new coronavirus. It was also a part-time Sexually transmitted disease, it can be spread through both sexual and casual contact. SARS is a zoonosis: it is a disease which comes from animals: it came from Asian palm civets to cave-dwelling horseshoe bats. Exactly how the virus got to humans is not known. SARS was first reported in Asia in February 2003. Over the next few months, the illness spread to more than 24 countries in Asia, North America, South America, and Europe before the SARS global outbreak of 2003 was contained. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a total of 8098 people worldwide became sick with SARS during the 2003 outbreak. 774 of them died. After the Chinese government suppressed news of the SARS outbreak, the disease spread rapidly, reaching Hong Kong and Vietnam in late February 2003, and then to other countries via international travellers. The last case in this outbreak occurred in June 2003. There were a total of 8437 known cases of the disease, with 813 deaths (a mortality rate of 9.636%). In May 2005 the disease itself was declared 'eradicated' by the World Health Organization and it became the second disease in mankind to receive this label (the other was smallpox). The ''The New York Times'' reported that "not a single case of severe acute respiratory syndrome has been reported this year or in late 2004. It is the first winter without a case since the initial outbreak in late 2002. Also, the epidemic strain of SARS that caused at least 813 deaths worldwide by June of 2003 has not been seen outside a laboratory since then."
