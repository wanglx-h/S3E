It is the county seat of Multnomah County. As of 2020, about 652,503 people live in the city of Portland, and about 2.5 million people live in the city's metropolitan area. It is in the northern Oregon, where the Willamette River meets the Columbia River. Portland has the second most people of any city in the Northwest United States, after the city of Seattle, Washington. Portland has many nicknames. One of these is "The City of Roses," because roses grow well there. Some other nicknames of Portland are "Stumptown" (because Portland was built over a forest), and "Puddletown" (because it often rains in Portland). Many things are from Portland. Some of these things are Powell's Books, Beverly Cleary (and some of her most popular fictional characters, Henry Huggins and Ramona Quimby, which also have statues in the city's ''Beverly Cleary Sculpture Garden for Children''), and the Portland Trail Blazers basketball team. ==References== Category:Portland, Oregon Category:Cities in Oregon Category:County seats in Oregon Category:1845 establishments in the United States Category:19th-century establishments in Oregon
