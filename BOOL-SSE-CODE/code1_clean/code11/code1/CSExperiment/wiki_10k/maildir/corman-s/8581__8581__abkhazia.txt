By Simon Saradzhyan ===2000s=== Georgia believes Abkhazia is part of its territory and has listed the province in its official subdivisions as an autonomous republic. On 28 August 2008, the Parliament of Georgia passed a resolution declaring Abkhazia a "Russian-occupied territory".[http://www.parliament.ge/index.php?lang_id=ENG&sec_id=98&info_id=20047 Resolution of the Parliament of Georgia declaring Abkhazia and South Ossetia occupied territories], 28 August 2008. The Republic of Abkhazia, with Sokhumi as its capital, is formally recognised by Russia and by Nicaragua, and the ''de facto'' independent republics of South Ossetia and Transnistria. The European Union, OSCE and NATO recognise Abkhazia as an integral part of the territory of Georgia (country). * * * * The secessionist movement of the Abkhaz minority led to the Georgian–Abkhaz conflict. The War in Abkhazia resulted in a Georgian military defeat and the mass exodus and ethnic cleansing of the Georgians population from Abkhazia. There was a 1994 ceasefire agreement. There is a United Nations-monitored and Russian-dominated Commonwealth of Independent States peacekeeping operation. The sovereignty dispute has not been resolved. The dispute is a source of conflict between Georgia and Russia. ==Related pages== * Gagra * Sokhumi * Pitsunda ==References== Category:Abkhazia Category:Caucasus Category:Nationalism Category:Puppet states Category:Occupied territories Category:1992 establishments in Asia Category:Autonomous republics of Georgia (country)
