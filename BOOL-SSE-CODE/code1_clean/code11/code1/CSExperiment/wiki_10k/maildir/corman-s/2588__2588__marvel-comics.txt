File:Marvel Comics 2024 logo.svg '''Marvel Comics''' is an United States comic book company that makes "superhero" comic books. Marvel was started in 1939 by Martin Goodman (publisher) as Timely Comics, and by 1951 had generally become known as Atlas Comics. The Marvel era began in 1961, the year that the company launched ''The Fantastic Four'' and other superhero titles created by Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko and many others. In 2009, The Walt Disney Company bought Marvel for US$4 billion. Its top rival is DC Comics (the publications of Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman). The company is known for featuring well-known characters such as Spider-Man, Hulk, Wolverine (character), the X-Men, Captain America, Iron Man, Thor (Marvel Comics), the Fantastic Four, Daredevil (Marvel Comics character), the Punisher, the Avengers, among others. The majority of its publications take place within the fictional Marvel Universe, with most locations mirroring real-life places; many major characters are based in New York City. Additionally, Marvel has published several licensed properties from other companies. This includes ''Star Wars'' comics twice from 1977 to 1986 and again since 2015. Marvel Comics has adapted its characters to different forms of media, including action figures, animated and live-action movies, animated and live-action television series, and video games, which have made them even more popular. == History == === Early beginnings (1930s-1940s) === Marvel Comics was originally founded as Timely Comics in 1939 by Martin Goodman (publisher). The first comic book published under this name was "Marvel Comics" #1, which featured characters like the Human Torch and Namor. During the 1940s, Timely gained popularity with the rise of superhero comics, particularly during World War II. Characters like Captain America, created by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby in 1941, became iconic symbols of patriotism. This era is often referred to as the "Golden Age of Comics." === Birth of Marvel Comics (1950s-1960s) === After the war, superhero comics declined in popularity, and Timely shifted focus to other genres. However, in the early 1960s, the superhero genre saw a resurgence. In 1961, the company rebranded as Marvel Comics. Stan Lee, along with artists like Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, created a new wave of superheroes that were more relatable and flawed. Key titles included the Fantastic Four, Spider-Man, the X-Men, the Hulk, and the Avengers. Marvel introduced complex characters and interconnected storylines, which became a hallmark of its comics. This era is often referred to as the "Marvel Age of Comics." === Expansion and popularity (1970s-1980s) === The 1970s saw the introduction of more diverse characters, including Black Panther (character), Luke Cage, and the Falcon (comics). Marvel also tackled social issues through its stories. The Bronze Age of Comics was marked by a more mature approach to storytelling, with themes addressing drug use, racism, and other societal issues. Marvel began to create large crossover events, such as "The Kree-Skrull War" and "The Infinity Saga," which brought together multiple characters and storylines. === Modern Era (1990s-2000s) === The 1990s saw a boom in comic book sales, driven by speculation and the introduction of variant covers. However, this bubble eventually burst, leading to a decline in sales. Marvel introduced new characters and teams, including the Ultimate Marvel, which reimagined classic characters for a new generation. The late 1990s and early 2000s saw the beginning of successful movie adaptations of Marvel characters, starting with ''Blade (movie)'' (1998) and ''X-Men (movie)'' (2000). == Characters == == Marvel characters in other media == Most of Marvel characters have been adapted from comics to different forms of media, including animated and live-action movies, animated and live-action television series, toys, and video games. In 2008, Marvel Studios launched the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) with ''Iron Man (movie)'', which became a massive success. This was followed by a series of interconnected movies, including ''The Avengers (movie)'' (2012), ''Black Panther (movie)'' (2018), and ''Avengers: Endgame'' (2019). The MCU has increasingly focused on diversity and representation, introducing characters from various backgrounds and cultures. Marvel expanded into television with series on networks and streaming platforms, including ''Daredevil (TV series)'' (2015-2018), ''WandaVision'' (2021), and Loki (TV series) (2021-2023). === Recent developments === Marvel continues to produce comics, movies, and television series, exploring new characters and storylines while maintaining its legacy. Marvel has become a significant part of popular culture, influencing not just comics but also movie, television, and merchandise. Marvel Comics has evolved from its early days as a publisher of superhero comics to a global entertainment powerhouse, shaping the landscape of modern storytelling and pop culture. == Offices == Located in New York City, Marvel has had successive headquarters: * In the McGraw-Hill Building, where it originated as Timely Comics in 1939. * In suite 1401 of the Empire State Building. * At 635 Madison Avenue (the actual location, though the comic books' indicia listed the owner creating-company's address of 625 Madison Avenue.) * 575 Madison Avenue. * 387 Park Avenue South. * 10 East 40th Street. * 417 Fifth Avenue. * A 60,000-square-foot (5,600 m2) space at 135 W. 50th Street. == References == Category:Marvel Comics Category:Disney companies
