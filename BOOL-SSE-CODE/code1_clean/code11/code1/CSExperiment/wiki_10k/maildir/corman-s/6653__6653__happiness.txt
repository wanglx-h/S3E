When someone feels good, proud, excited, relieved or satisfied about something, that person is said to be "happy". Feeling happy may help people to relax and to smile. Happiness is usually thought of as the opposite of sadness. However, it is very possible to feel both at once, often about different things, or sometimes even about the same thing. You are often excited when you are happy. Happiness can also be inspired too. Many philosophers have said that people in the world go back and forth between times of happiness and sadness, but there is nobody who is always happy or always sad. Happiness sometimes causes people to cry when they laugh because the emotion takes control of them. Happiness was thought of as the key to love in Ancient history civilizations such as the Inca and the Maya civilization. ==Other websites== *[https://www.youtube.com/@TalBenShahar-HSA Dr Tal Ben-Shahar | Happiness Studies Academy] on YouTube Category:Emotions
