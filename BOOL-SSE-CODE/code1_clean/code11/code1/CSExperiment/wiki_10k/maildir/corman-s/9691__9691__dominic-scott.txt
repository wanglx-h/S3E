He is the co-founder of a band named,"The Lotus Eaters" It was founded in 1995 withTim Rice-Oxley. They invited Richard Hughes to play the drums. In 1997 Rice-Oxley asked Scott and Hughes to let Tom Chaplin join the band. Scott and Hughes firstly refused but then accepted. He left in 2001, after the single "Wolf at the Door" because of musical differences with Rice-Oxley. His exit was friendly. Keane wrote a message on their official page on 14 November 2001 saying this: :"One sad piece of news for us is that in July our guitarist Dom decided to leave the band and return to his studies at LSE. We wish him all the best with that." Rice-Oxley also said in an interview in Mexico: "Dom is a great fan of U2 so maybe we'll met in New York City" (Because Keane was the opening band for U2 in 2005).
