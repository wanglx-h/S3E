Subject: Sterilisation
'''Sterilisation''' (which some people spell '''sterilization''') is a wikt:process that makes animals or humans unable to reproduce. Sterilisation completely stops people from having children most of the time. Sterilisation often is done for a way of birth control, or for people to go "childfree". But it has often been done against the will of a person. This is called "compulsory sterilization". == Related pages == * Sterilization (microbiology) Category:Biological reproduction
