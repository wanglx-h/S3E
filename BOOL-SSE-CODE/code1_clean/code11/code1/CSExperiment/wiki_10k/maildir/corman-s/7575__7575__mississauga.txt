In January 2010, the Mississaugas and the Government of Canada settled a land claim. The aboriginal people received $145,000,000 from that. After the land was surveyed, much of it was given in the form of land grants to United Empire Loyalists. They Emigration from the Thirteen Colonies during and after the American Revolution, as well as loyalists from New Brunswick. A group of settlers from New York City arrived in the 1830s. In 1820, the government purchased additional land from the Mississaugas. Additional settlements were established, including: Barbertown, Britannia, Burnhamthorpe, Derry West, Elmbank, Ontario, Malton, Ontario, Meadowvale, Ontario, Mount Charles, and Streetsville, Ontario. European-Canadian growth led to the eventual displacement of the Mississaugas. In 1847, the government relocated them to New Credit in the Grand River, Ontario, near present-day Hagersville, Ontario. In 1873, the Toronto Township Council was formed to oversee the events of the various villages that were Unincorporated area at that time. The council's responsibilities included road maintenance, and a police force. Most of present-day Mississauga was Agriculture: including fruit orchards, through much of the 19th and first half of the 20th century. Exceptions included small villages, some gristmills and brickworks served by railway lines, In the 1920s, cottages were constructed along the shores of Lake Ontario for people who lived in the city. 17 years later in 1937, 1,410.8acres of land was sold to build the Malton Airport (later known as the Pearson Airport). It became Canada's busiest airport which also put the end to the community of Elmank. The township settlements of Lakeview, Cooksville, Lorne Park, Clarkson, Erindale, Sheridan, Dixie, Meadowvale Village, and Malton, Ontario were combined in 1968 to form the Town of Mississauga. At the time, both Port Credit, Ontario and Streetsville were left out and remained separate. The town name was chosen by voting. In 1974, Port Credit and Streetsville became part of Mississauga. In that same year, the Square One Shopping Centre opened. On November 10, 1979, 1979 Mississauga train derailment on the Canadian Pacific rail line while carrying explosive and poisonous chemicals just north of the intersection of Mavis Road and Dundas Street (Ontario). One of the tank cars carrying propane exploded. Since other tank cars were carrying chlorine, the decision was made to evacuate nearby residents. With the possibility of a deadly cloud of chlorine gas spreading through Mississauga, 218,000 people were evacuated. Residents were allowed to return home, once the area was safe. It was one of the largest evacuations in North American history. == Geography == File:Mississauga overview map.svg Mississauga covers of land, with of shoreline on Lake Ontario. == Statistics == Mississauga is a large and multicultural city.
