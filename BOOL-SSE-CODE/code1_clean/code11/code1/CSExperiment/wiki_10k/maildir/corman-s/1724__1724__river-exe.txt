Image:ExeEstuaryAtPowderham.jpg The '''River Exe''' is a river in the county of Devon in England. It flows south through the city of Exeter. Exe Island was made in the 10th century by draining the marshlands between the city walls and the river. The island had many mill (grinding) making paper and textiles. The wide estuary of the River Exe is a ria (drowned river valley). The Exeter Ship Canal goes along next to the river from Exeter down to the estuary. The name of the city of Exeter means "castle on the river Exe". ==References== * [http://www.exetermemories.co.uk/EM/exeter_leats.html The Leats of Exeter - A Short History] Category:Rivers of Devon
