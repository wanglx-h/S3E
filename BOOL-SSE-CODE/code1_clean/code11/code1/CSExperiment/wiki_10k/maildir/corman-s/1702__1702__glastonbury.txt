Image:Summit of glastonbury tor.jpg '''Glastonbury''' is a town in Somerset, England. It is well known for being mistakenly thought of where Glastonbury Festival is held, however the festival is in fact held in the village of Pilton, nearly 7 miles to the east. ==History== Glastonbury is also well known because of Glastonbury Abbey. This is because Glastonbury Abbey is said to be the place where King Arthur is buried, and it was burned down when King Henry the Eighth got angry at all Catholic monasteries in the country as the Pope would not grant him a divorce. The abbot, Abbot Whiting, was killed on the Tor, a local landmark. ==Gallery== Glastonbury-42-Tor-2004-gje.jpg Glastonbury-46-Landschaft-2004-gje.jpg Glastonbury Abbey-08-Kueche-2004-gje.jpg Glastonbury Abbey-10-2004-gje.jpg Glastonbury-32-Laeden-2004-gje.jpg Glastonbury-04-Strasse-2004-gje.jpg Glastonbury-26-Esoterik-Hof-2004-gje.jpg Glastonbury-12-Schaufenster-2004-gje.jpg Category:Towns in Somerset Category:Civil parishes in Somerset
