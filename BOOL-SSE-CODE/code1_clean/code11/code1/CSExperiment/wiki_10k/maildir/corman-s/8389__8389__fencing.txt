File:0408 USA Olympic fencing.jpg File:Fencing pictogram.svg '''Fencing''' is a sport for two people with different kinds of swords. The aim is to score hits. There is also a referee. == Weapons == === Foil === File:Fencing foil valid surfaces.svg The foil is a light and easy to bend weapon, first made in mid 17th century as a weapon for practice. 'Hits' can only be scored by hitting the target area with the point of the sword. The target area is the torso. === Épée === File:Fencing epee valid surfaces.svg The épée is the heaviest of the three weapons. To score a hit, the push-button on the end of the weapon must remain fully down for 2-10 milliseconds, and must arrive (hit) with a Force (physics) of at least 7.35 newton (unit)s. The target area for Épée is the entire body. This includes the feet and the head. === Sabre === File:Fencing saber valid surfaces.svg The sabre is the "cutting" weapon, with a curved guard (to protect the hand) and a triangular blade. However, in wikt:simple:modern electric scoring, a touch with any part of the sabre, (point, flat or edge, as long as it is on target) will count as a hit. The target area in sabre is everything from the waist up, except for the hands. == Uniform == Fencers wear a uniform to avoid injury. They wear a mask of black mesh with a bib. Also, a jacket, short pants and a sort of half-a-shirt (called an underarm protector or plastron), all of white fabric. They must also wear socks that cover their legs. Women must wear a chest protector. These are collectively called "whites." == Related pages == *''Kendo'' *Swordsmanship == Other websites == * [http://www.fie.ch/ Fédération Internationale d'Escrime] The organisation responsible for all international fencing Category:Fencing Category:Summer Olympic sports
