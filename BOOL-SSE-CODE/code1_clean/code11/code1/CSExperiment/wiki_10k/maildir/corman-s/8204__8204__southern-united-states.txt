File:Map_of_USA_South.svg.]] The '''Southern United States''' (also known as the '''Southern States''' or the '''South''') is a term for the southeast of the United States. All of the states in the Confederate States of America were in the South, but not all Southern states joined the Confederacy. The Slave states and free states that did not join are called the "border states (American Civil War)." The Southern States that are the farthest to the south are called the "Deep South." Even though Arizona, New Mexico, and Southern California are geographically south in the United States, they are usually classified as being part of the Southwestern United States, not the South. Their climate, culture, and Ethnic groups of the United States of the Southwest are different from those of the South. Most of the South is a land of long, hot summers. Winters are mostly short and cool. There is much rainfall. That combination gives the South a long growing season. Important crops include cotton, tobacco, peanuts, and peaches. Also, the cuisine of the Southern United States is distinct from those of other regions. As defined by the United States Census Bureau, these states make up the South: # Alabama # Arkansas # Delaware # Florida # Georgia (U.S. state) # Kentucky # Louisiana # Maryland # Mississippi # North Carolina # Oklahoma # South Carolina # Tennessee # Texas # Virginia # Washington, D.C. (although not a state) # West Virginia The border state of Missouri is also sometimes considered Southern although the Census classifies it as in the Midwestern United States. Except for Florida and Texas, most of the South had few Immigration, unlike the rest of the United States, in the late 19th and the 20th centuries. Most of the people in the South are of English people, Scottish people, or Irish people ancestry or the descendants of African-American slaves. Some Southerners identify themselves as being of "Americans" ancestry. Category:Census Regions of the United States
