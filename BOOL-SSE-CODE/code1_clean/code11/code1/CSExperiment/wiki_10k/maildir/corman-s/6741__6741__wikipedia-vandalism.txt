Subject: Wikipedia:Vandalism
File:Wikipedia vandalism.svg On Wikipedia, '''vandalism''' is when a user makes WP:DISRUPT to Wikipedia on purpose. They might do any or all of the things listed below. Vandalism is a very bad problem, and people who keep doing it may be Wikipedia:Bans and blocks from making changes. Test edits, like those made in the Wikipedia:sandbox are usually not vandalism. But in some cases, it can be, especially if the content is Swear word or Wikipedia:No personal attacks. There are two Wikipedias in Modern English language; the Simple English Wikipedia and the regular :en:Main Page. Sometimes, vandals from the English Wikipedia will come here to vandalize. Vandalizing from multiple wikis is called cross-wiki vandalism and can lead to meta:Global locks (basically blocking them from editing) on all Wikimedia websites. This is known as a global lock. meta:Stewards (a type of user with high privileges across all Wikimedia websites) have the ability to apply these global locks. ==How to fight vandalism== '''You can help''' "fight" vandalism. This means getting rid of bad changes by other users. It's very easy, and you don't even need to Wikipedia:Why create an account?! Here's how: #Go to the Special:Recentchanges. This shows you the most recent changes that any user makes to any page. You can also find a link to this page near the top left corner while you are on Wikipedia, under Logo of Wikipedia. #Click on one of the "m:Help:Diff" links to see the change made by the user on the page listed on the new changes page. To help you choose which "diff" to see, here are some things to look out for: #*IP address or new accounts —most vandalism is done by someone who is not logged in or is new. However if they are anonymous user, you will see their IP address instead of a username. #*:en:Wikipedia:Article size - the green or red number tells you how much content the user added or removed from the page. If it's a very large number (which may also appear as '''Bold (type)'''), there's a good chance that it could be vandalism. #*Wikipedia:Change summary - this is meant to tell other users what has been changed. Many vandals do not write anything, but if they do, it appears in brackets "(" and ")" and in ''italics''. Look especially for common sentences like "Fixed typo" or "Added content" - these are called :en:Wikipedia:Canned edit summary and can often be "misleading", or in other words, not tell the truth. It may look to be any other normal change, but could be vandalism. #*Special:Tags - Wikipedia has Wikipedia:change filter that try to stop users from making changes if they do not seem to be good, such as if there is a slang or swear word. In this case, you could see a "tag" that says something like "blanking", "repeating characters", or even "possible vandalism". Also, keep in mind that test changes are also more likely to be made from a mobile device or using the "Wikipedia:VisualEditor", in which case you would see a "mobile edit" or "visual edit" tag. #Once you see the change, you have to decide whether it is vandalism or not. If you aren't sure, don't do anything, and ask someone for help—remember the proverb, "better safe than sorry". If you are sure that an edit is vandalism, then you should remove it immediately. What you should do depends on whether the vandalism was done on a new page or not (to find out, click on "View history" at the top of the page): #*If the vandalism was done on a new page that meets the WP:QD#Quick deletion (nobody else has made or changed it except the vandal(s)—there may be more than one), put the code on it and replace "reason" with why it should be Wikipedia:Deletion policy. If an WP:administrator agrees with you, they will delete the page and everything on it. #*If the vandalism was done on a page that is not new (other people have made or changed the page but are not vandals), Help:Revert a page, if it has not been done already. You can usually do this by clicking "undo" beside the word "change" beside "Latest revision" and then saving the page (if you see "Revision" but not "Latest revision", the change may have already been reverted, and you should click "Newer diff" until you see "Latest revision" to make sure). Make sure that after you revert the change, there is no more vandalism on the page. You may have to revert more than one change (which is where Wikipedia:Rollback feature becomes very helpful for). #Once the vandalism is gone, it is a good idea to give the vandal a warning that they should not do it again. To do this, go to their talk page (by clicking "talk" beside their username or IP address) and put a warning Wikipedia:Template messages (a message that has already been set) on it. There are many ways to warn these users; some of them Wikipedia:Vandalism#Warnings. You should always look at what is already on that page as well as the user's other changes (you can check them by clicking on the "changes" link next to the username on the new changes page, or, for an anonymous user, you can click on their IP address). #If users continue to vandalize pages (look out for other contributions that have been reverted, or other warning templates on their talk page), go to Wikipedia:Vandalism in progress and follow the instructions there to report the vandal to "administrators". They are able to Wikipedia:Blocks and bans users who do not follow the Wikipedia:Rules, and this includes vandalism. If the request is urgent, please ping administrators in the WP:IRC channel using !admin@simplewiki or in the WP:DISCORD channel #simple-english-wikipedia using @SimpleEnglishAdmins That's it! If you want to know more about how to help fight vandalism, you can always ask questions at Wikipedia:Simple talk. '''Note:''' Not all of these warning templates are for vandalism. ==Tracing IP addresses== For repeated vandalism by anonymous IP addresses, it is helpful to Wikipedia:Vandalism#Tracing IP addresses and add to the user talk page of the address. The owners of IP addresses can be found using: * [http://ws.arin.net/whois ARIN] (North America) * [http://www.ripe.net/fcgi-bin/whois RIPE NCC] (Europe, the Middle East and Central Asia) * [http://www.apnic.net/db/index.html APNIC] (Asia Pacific) * [http://lacnic.net/sp/index.html LACNIC] (Latin American and Caribbean) * [http://www.afrinic.net/ AfriNIC] (Africa) If an address is not in one, it might be in a different one. ==Anti vandalism tools== ===Twinkle=== ''WP:Twinkle'' is a script that allows autoconfirmed users to Help:reverting and warn vandals. ===Vandal Warner=== ''Vandal Warner'' is a Wikipedia:Gadget you can use to warn the vandals more easily. In order to use it, you should click on the ''Special:Preferences'' link and go to the "Gadgets" tab. Then you should select ''Vandal Warner'' and save the settings. Of course, you can use gadgets only when you are logged in. ===Navigation popups=== :en:Wikipedia:Tools/Navigation popups has a revert script in it that lets you revert to a specific version, to add this: # Go to My Settings # Go to Gadgets # Check Navigation popups (API) # Click save After that, you will need to flush your old monobook.js from your cache. Pressing Ctrl+F5 on some browsers might work, or Ctrl-R on some others. Then it will work, if not ask for help. There are other anti-vandalism gadgets there besides these. ==Related pages== * Wikipedia:Spam * m:Vandalbot * Wikipedia:Vandalism in progress * m:Anti-vandalism ideas * [irc://irc.libera.chat/cvn-simplewikis #cvn-simplewikis] an IRC channel dedicated to fighting vandalism on Simple English Wikipedia and Wiktionary
