'''Inheritance''' is the practice of passing on property, nobilitys, debts, and duties when someone death. Those things usually go to family members. People have had laws about inheritance for thousands of years. The question is often settled in a will (law). If only sons and other male family members get the inheritance, it is called kinship inheritance. If only daughters and other female family members get the inheritance, it is called matrilineality succession. In some cases inheritance depends on legitimacy. Cultural inheritance is called legacy. Gene inheritance is called heredity. A kingdom may be inherited, and the person who is expected to inherit is called the heir apparent. The person who gets the property and other things when someone dies is called the heir (male) or heiress (female). '''Inheritance tax''' is a tax paid by a person who inherits money or property of someone who has died. Category:Death customs Category:Property law
