Nobel left 31 million Swedish krona (the Swedish currency) to the awards after his death on December 10, 1896. The artificial element Nobelium is named for him. ==Early life== Nobel was born on October 21, 1833. His father, Immanuel Nobel, was an engineer and inventor. His mother was Andriette Ahlsell Nobel.
