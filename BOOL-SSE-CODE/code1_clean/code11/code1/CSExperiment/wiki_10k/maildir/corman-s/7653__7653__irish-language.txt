It is less similar to Breton language, Cornish language and Welsh language. The Celtic languages are divided into two groups: P-Celtic languages and Q-Celtic languages. Irish, Scottish Gaelic and Manx are Q-Celtic languages, and Breton, Cornish and Welsh is a P-Celtic language. For that reason, many Irish-speakers can understand some Scots Gaelic but not Welsh. Irish has nowords for "yes" or "no". == History == === Before the United Kingdom === Queen Elizabeth I of England tried to learn Irish and asked her Bishop to translate the Bible into Irish.The Field Day Anthology of Irish Writing Volume IV Irish Women's Writings and Traditions Deane, Seamus Angela Bourke Andrew Carpenter Jonathan Williams 2002 New York University Press New York New York page 365 That was an attempt to split the Catholicism people from their clergy and make them Protestantism, but it mostly failed. === In the United Kingdom === Until the 19th century, most people in Ireland spoke Irish. However, that changed after Ireland joined Great Britain in 1801 to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Ireland’s State school became part of the British system and so had to teach English language. Sometimes, they were not allowed to teach Irish. The Catholic Church also began to discourage Irish. The same is true for the Irish Nationalism leader Daniel O'Connell. He was an Irish-speaker himself but thought that people should speak English since most job opportunities were in the English-speaking British Empire and United States. == Today == Today, Irish is the first official language of the Republic of Ireland and has around 2 million speakers. In practice, the Government of Ireland still uses English more than Irish. Also, most people in the country speak English in their day-to-day lives. However, many people speak Irish among friends or family. It is also taught in all Irish schools according to the law. In parts of Ireland called the Gaeltacht (''Gaeltachtaí'' in Irish), people still speak Irish as their first language, and up to 70% of the people speak Irish. The newest Gaeltacht in the country is on Falls Road, in Belfast, where the whole community tries to use Irish as its first language. The area is called the Gaeltacht Quarter. == Literature == There were great poets who wrote in Irish. Their poems became songs. Often, they told stories about the heroes of old times.File:Gaeltacht.svg == Common words and phrase == * aon = one (ain) * dó = two (doe) * trí = three (tree) * ceathair = four (ka-her) * cúig = five (coo-igg) * sé = six (shay) * seacht = seven (shocked) * ocht = eight (uckt) * naoi = nine (knee) * deich = ten (dje) * céad = one hundred (kayd) * dhá chéad = two hundred (gah kayd) * Dia Dhuit = Hello (literal translation is "God be with you") (jia gwitch) * Céad Mile Fáilte = One hundred thousand welcomes (kayd me-lah fall-tcha) * Ceist ag éinne? = Anyone have a question?
