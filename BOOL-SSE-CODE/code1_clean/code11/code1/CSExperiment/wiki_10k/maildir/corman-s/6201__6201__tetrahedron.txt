File:Tetrahedron.gif A '''tetrahedron''' or '''triangular pyramid''' is a polyhedron (a three-dimensional shape). It has four Vertex and six edges. All four of its faces are Equilateral triangle. Every two edges meet on one of those corners forming a sixty-degree angle. == Formulas for a regular tetrahedron == A '''regular tetrahedron''' is a tetrahedron whose edges are the same length. If the length of an edge is ''a'': {| class="wikitable" |+ |Surface areaHarold Scott MacDonald Coxeter; ''Regular Polytopes (book)'', Methuen and Co., 1948, Table I(i) |{\sqrt{3}}a^2\, |- |Face area |\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}a^2\, |- |HeightKöller, Jürgen, [http://www.mathematische-basteleien.de/tetrahedron.htm "Tetrahedron"], Mathematische Basteleien, 2001 |\sqrt{\frac23}\,a\, and \frac{\sqrt{6}}{3}a |- |Volume |\frac{a^3}{6\sqrt{2}}\, and \frac{\sqrt{2}}{12}a^3 |} == Other properties == A regular tetrahedron's faces are all the same, and so are all its edges, as well as its corners. This makes it a regular polyhedron. It is also convex (its faces do not go through one another), which makes it a Platonic solid. The dual of regular tetrahedron is another regular tetrahedron. This is called being self-dual. ==References== Category:Platonic solids
