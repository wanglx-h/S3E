File:Tales of the Round table; based on the tales in the Book of romance (1908) (14766955365).jpg and the Questing Beast.]] '''Fantasy''' is a genre of fiction (make believe) that shows some form of Witchcraft or supernatural elements. Often fantasy also means that the story happens in a fictional place, a world different from our own (e.g. Middle-earth or Narnia). Although the word fantasy is most often applied to low-tech worlds, it also can depict high tech worlds, overlapping with science fiction (science fantasy). Or it is used for history fiction, if it is magical in some way. ==Related pages== *Fairy tale *Folklore ==Other websites== *[https://citizendium.org/wiki/Fantasy_(storytelling) Fantasy (storytelling)] -Citizendium Category:Fantasy
