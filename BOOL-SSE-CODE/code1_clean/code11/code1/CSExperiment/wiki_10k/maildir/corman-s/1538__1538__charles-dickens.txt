His parents were John Dickens (1785-1851),[http://www.myheritage.com/FP/family-tree.php?s=50445521&familyTreeID=1 Dickens Family Tree website] a navy pay clerk, and Elizabeth Barrow (1789–1863). When Dickens was born, he had dyslexia and so he could not read or write properly, unlike other kids. When Charles was 12 years old, his family moved to Camden, London. He worked in a blacking (shoe polish) factory there while his father was in prison for debt. Dickens's hard times in the factory served as a foundation of ideas for many of his novels. Many of them, like ''Oliver Twist'', later became famous. When his great-grandmother died and transmitted money, Charles' father paid off his debts and was released from prison. Charles did not like working and wished to stop after his father had been released. However, his mother said that the family needed the money and so Charles was forced to continue working. Charles then finished his schooling and got a job as an office boy for an attorney. After finding that job dull, he taught himself shorthand and became a journalist that reports on the government. Dickens was a Unitarian. == Author == His first book was ''Sketches by Boz'' in 1836, a collection of the short pieces that he had been writing for the ''Monthly Magazine'' and the ''Evening Chronicle''. This was followed by ''The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club'' in 1837. Both books became popular as soon as they were printed. The high production costs of making ''A Christmas Carol'' led to reduced profits, and the first edition brought him only rather than the he expected. A year later, the profits were only , and Dickens was deeply disappointed.|group=n}} Charles Dickens died of a stroke on June 9, 1870. He was buried in Poets' Corner in Westminster Abbey.
