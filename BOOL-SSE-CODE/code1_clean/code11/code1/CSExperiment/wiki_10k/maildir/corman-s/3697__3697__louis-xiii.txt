He was the son of Henri IV of France and Marie de' Medici. He lived during the time of the Thirty Years War and had to deal with many rebellions. He was proud of his country, and tried to encourage French artists to stay in France instead of going off to Italy. He did this by giving them work in the Louvre. His chief minister, Armand Jean du Plessis (known as Cardinal (Catholic Church) Richelieu), helped with consolidating royal power to help Louis XIII, stopping new domestic factions from gaining much power, and shaping French foreign policy at the time. Cardinal Richelieu was consort until his death in 1642. The year which he became King Louis XIII's chief minister was 1624. He remained in office for 18 years. King Louis XIII, with the help of his cardinal, affected the 30 years war and its outcome, even though most of Louis XIII's actions were indirect.
