File:The peaches of New York (1917) (14595802329).jpg A '''stone fruit''', also called a '''drupe''', is a fruit with a large "stone" inside. The stone is sometimes called the seed, but that is a mistake, as the seed is inside the stone. The stones can also be called a pit. These fruits are edible and used frequently in cooking. == Identification == === What makes a fruit? === A fruit is the matured Ovary (botany) of a flower. Fruits consist of two main parts: the pericarp, or ovary wall, and the seed(s). The pericarp has three layers: the exocarp (skin/rind), the mesocarp (bulk of the pericarp), and the endocarp (innermost layer). === Berries vs. drupes === The two main classes of fleshy fruits are Berry and drupes, or stone fruits. Berries have a fleshy mesocarp and endocarp, and may have multiple seeds. Drupes have a fleshy mesocarp, but a tough endocarp, and of course, a "stone" or "pit" at its center. Drupes typically have only a single seed. == Examples of stone fruits == {| class="wikitable sortable mw-collapsible" |+Stone Fruits ! !Scientific name !Description !What's the pit? !In pop culture |- |Apricots |Prunus armeniaca | | | * St. Ives' Apricot Scrub * Stardew Valley |- |Plumcot | |apricot/plum hybrid | | |- |Blackberry |Rubus | | | * BlackBerry * Blackberry (''Watership Down''), a fictional rabbit * Blackberri, American singer-songwriter and community activist * Wren Blackberry, children's fiction author * "Blackberry" (song), by the Black Crowes * "Blackberry Way", by The Move * "Blackberry Blossom" (tune), a traditional fiddle tune |- |Cherry | | | | * cherry pie * Stardew Valley * I Kissed a Girl * cherry ChapStick * ''Animal Crossing'' |- |Coconuts | | | | * Mario Kart * ''Animal Crossing'' * ''Stardew Valley'' * Coconut emoji: 🥥 * coconut bras 🥥🥥 * "Coconut" song by Harry Nilsson * "Midnight Margaritas" scene in the film Practical Magic in which the song "Coconut" by Harry Nilsson plays |- |Date palm | | | | *poison dates in ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' |- |Green almonds | |the fruit of an almond tree, containing the pit or "nut" commonly referred to as an almond | | * almond butter * "almond moms" * Almond Joy |- |Lychees | | | | * lychee martini |- |Mangoes |Mangifera indica | | | * ''The House on Mango Street'' * the mango emoji |- |Marionberry | |a cultivar of blackberries | | * Marionberry pancakes in ''Portlandia'' |- |Mulberry |Morus | | | * ''Mulberry Tree'', a painting by Vincent Van Gogh * A Babylonian etiological myth, explored by Publius Ovidius Naso in Metamorphoses, attributes the red color of mulberries to the deaths of Pyramus and Thisbe, a pair of ill-fated lovers * The House on Mulberry Street * ''And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street'' |- |Nectarines |Prunus persica var. nucipersica | | | |- |Olive (fruit) |Olea europaea | | | * Olive, the Other Reindeer * olive oil * :en:Olive_Oyl, fictional character from the ''Popeye'' series * Olive Penderghast, fictional character from ''Easy A'' * Green Olive, Papillon Fashion's 2025 color of the year * black olives on pizza |- |Peaches |Prunus persica | |Peach pit | *Princess Peach, fictional character from the Mario franchise *The peach emoji * James and the Giant Peach (movie) * Peaches, a mammoth from the Ice Age (franchise) voiced by Keke Palmer *Animal Crossing *Stardew Valley *The Daring Book for Girls by Miriam Peskowitz contains instructions to create a peach pit ring *Peach-Pit *Peaches and cream *Peach motif in the 2017 film ''Call Me by Your Name (movie)'' |- |Plums |prunus domestica | | | * Sugar Plum Fairy * Stardew Valley * Professor Plum, a fictional character from the board game Cluedo |- |Plumcot | |plum/apricot hybrid | | |- |Salmonberry |rubus spectabilis | | | * Stardew Valley |} Category:Food ingredients Category:Food-related lists
