Today, about 275,000 people live there (with around 780,000 in the metropolitan area). It lies on the left bank of the Rhine, opposite the Germany city of Kehl. Strasbourg is the seat Council of Europe, of the European Court of Human Rights and of the European Parliament. A lot of people also consider Strasbourg to be the capital of the European Union. == History == Its old town, la Grande Île ("Grand Island") has been classified as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.

Its Celtic name was ''Argentorate'' (which the Ancient Rome called ''Argentoratum''). People think this name is linked to the river Ill (that flows into the Rhine near Strasbourg). At that time, it was on the Limes, a fortification the Romans built across Europe (to keep out the Germanic tribes). There was a fortification (named ''castella drusi'', ''drusus fort'') at that spot. Soldiers need to live from something, so a local civilian settlement developed there. Later, the Limes was pushed farther east. == Climate == Strasbourg has an oceanic climate (''Cfb'' in the Köppen climate classification). == Education == * École nationale supérieure d'informatique pour l'industrie et l'entreprise * École pour l'informatique et les nouvelles technologies * École pour l'informatique et les techniques avancées * EM Strasbourg Business School * Institut supérieur européen de gestion group * ISG Business School * Web@cademie ==References== Category:Imperial free cities Category:Strasbourg Category:World Heritage Sites in France Category:1262 establishments Category:1260s establishments in Europe Category:Cities in France
