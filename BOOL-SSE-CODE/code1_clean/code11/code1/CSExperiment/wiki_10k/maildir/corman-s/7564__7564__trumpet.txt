The most common type of trumpet is a B♭ trumpet, meaning that if the player plays a C, it will sound like a B♭ in Scale (music). The trumpet is played by blowing into the Mouthpiece (brass) and making a "buzzing" sound. The buzzing sound is made by the vibration of the lips blown by the player. There are three keys called valves that the player can press to change the Pitch (music). == History == File:Street wind quartet, with trumpet and trombones.

The Instrument Place|url=https://www.theinstrumentplace.com/history-of-the-trumpet|access-date=2024-06-21|website=www.theinstrumentplace.com}} An early example of a brass instrument like a trumpet is called a shofar, which is still used in religious ceremonies. Eventually people started making trumpet-like instruments with wood (for example, the cornetto), and later, with brass. Modern bugles are similar to early metal trumpets. Many years ago, when the use of instrumental music was growing, trumpets became very important. Trumpets were long and without valves. This meant a player had to control the pitch of the sound with only his mouth, which was very difficult. Everyone respected trumpet players because trumpets were just so difficult to play. The chromatic trumpet was developed in the late 18th century. In the 19th century, good valves made it easier to play notes on the trumpet. Still, trumpet is a difficult instrument to master. == Music for trumpet == Classical music is written for solo trumpet, and trumpets are included in orchestras. Trumpets play an important part in Jazz music, and other various popular genres. Sometimes, they also play short parts to emphasize sections in rock songs. == Trumpet players == Some famous classical trumpet players are Adolph Herseth, Sergei Nakariakov and Maurice Andre. Some famous jazz trumpet players are Miles Davis, Louis Armstrong, Arturo Sandoval, Wynton Marsalis, Dizzy Gillespie, and Maynard Ferguson. ==References== ==Other websites== Category:Brass instruments Category:Jazz instruments
