Subject: Liancourt Rocks
The '''Liancourt Rocks''' are a group of small islands in the Sea of Japan. In Korea they are called '''Dokdo''' (). In Japan they are called '''Takeshima''' (). The islands are currently occupied under the South Korean armed police. The name Liancourt Rocks comes from the France whaling ship Liancourt. The people on the Liancourt made a map of the islands in 1849. Korea and Japan both say that the islands are theirs, and have for a long time. Japan has suggested asking the International Court of Justice to decide, but the South Korean government refused.

A wide variety of fish as well as seaweed, kelp, sea slugs, and clams live around the islets. Major fishery catches in the area are squid, Alaskan pollock, codfish, and octopus. There are 102 species of seaweed, although many of these have no economic value. This area used to be one of the largest breeding grounds of sea lions (''Zalophus californianus japonicus'') and a good spot for hunting them and also a spot for obtaining abalone at the end of the Meiji period (1868-1912).[http://www.pref.shimane.lg.jp/soumu/takesima_eng/take4.html Historically,Takeshima belongs to Japan] , Shimane Prefectural Government, Japan Until the 1950s, sea lions were observed on the islets by the voluntary guards.(ko) "50년대 독도의용수비대가 활약할 당시만 해도 20∼30마리씩 떼를 지어 독도 연안에서 서식하는장면이 목격됐다. 독도의용수비대원이던 이규현씨(82·울릉군 울릉읍 도동리)는 "당시 독도에서 강치(바다사자) 무리를 간간이 볼 수 있었고, 울릉도 주민들은 이를 가재, 강치로 부르기도 했다"고 말했다."

Retrieved 18 January, 2006. == Climate == Due to the location of the isle, the weather of the Liancourt Rocks is known to be harsh. As a result, ships can not dock in winter as the north-western winds are too strong. T he climate is warm and humid. It is heavily influenced by warm sea currents. There is a lot of rain throughout the year (annual average - 1324mm), with occasional snowfall. Fog is common. In the summer, southerly winds dominate. The water around the islets is about 10 degrees Celsius in spring, when the water is coolest. It warms to about 25 degrees Celsius in August. == Ecology == Like Ulleung-do, the islets are volcano rocks, with only a thin layer of soil and moss. About 80 species of plants, over 22 species of birds, and 37 species of insects have been recorded on the islets, in addition to the local maritime life. Since the early 1970s, trees and some types of flowers were planted along with the indigenous flora and fauna. (Trees are required under international law for the islands to be recognized as natural islands rather than reefs.) Liancourt Rocks was declared "Natural Monument #336" by South Korea in the 1990s. Some birds actually live on the islands, but most are just using them as a stopover to fly elsewhere. The fork-tailed petrel, streaked shearwater, and Black-tailed Gull live on the islands. The population of breeding birds counted on the rocks, however, has been declining in recent years. In 1999, the islands were designated a special environmental protected area by the South Korean government. They are older than any other Korean volcanic islands, including Ulleungdo. It was announced in 2005 that three new genera and five new species of bacteria had been identified by Korean scientists in the waters off the islets. The genera are ''Dokdonella koreensis'', ''Dokdonia donghaenensis'', and ''Donghae dokdoensis''. The newly identified species are ''Virgilbacillus dokdoensis'', ''Maribacter dokdoensis'', ''Marimonas dokdoensis'', ''Polaribacter dokdoensis'', and ''Porphyrobacter dokdoensis''. == Strategic location == The islets are of importance not only for economic reasons, but also for military ones. They have occasionally served as a military base, most notably during the Russo-Japanese War. The South Korean government has built a radar station and helicopter landing pad on the islets, enabling it to track foreign naval forces.[http://vn.vladnews.ru/issue592/Special_reports/Dokdo_Islands_land_of_contention Vladivostok News report] == References == == Other websites == === Official sites === * [http://www.korea.net/News/Issues/issueView.asp?issue_no=45 South Korean government's perspective on Dokdo via Korea.net] === Pro-Korea === * [http://www.dokdonews.net/ dodkdonews.net: News updates on the disputed islets] * [http://www.geocities.com/mlovmo/page4.html The Territorial Dispute Over Dokdo, compiled by Mark S.
