It is in the northeastern section of the country along the coast of the Atlantic Ocean. It is a geographically small state, shaped like a letter [S], and bordered on the west by Pennsylvania and Delaware across the Delaware River, on the north by New York (state), on the northeast by the Hudson River and New York City, on the east and southeast by the Atlantic Ocean, and on the southwest by Delaware Bay. New Jersey is divided into 21 counties. The Capital (city) of New Jersey is Trenton, New Jersey and the largest city is Newark, New Jersey, though New Jersey is better known for bordering the large cities of New York City and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The state nickname is "The Garden State". The current governor is Phil Murphy. New Jersey is the fourth smallest state, but has the eleventh highest number of people. It therefore has the highest '''population density''' (number of people for the amount of land) in the United States. New Jersey is also well known for its beaches, industries, swamps, and pine forests. The climate is hot and humid summers and cold winters, with about of precipitation every year. The average temperature in the summer is between and , and in winter around 16°F (-9°C) to 34°F (1°C). ==History== Before Europeans came, the land that is now New Jersey was inhabited by the Lenape (also known as Delaware Indians by the English), who were nomads, hunters, and farmers. The Dutch Empire came to the northern area of the state in the 1630s, after Henry Hudson explored the area, thought it was a nice place, and claimed it for the Dutch. Towns quickly sprang up, occupied by the Netherlands, Swedes, and Finns. People rushed in. The first towns, such as Bergen (now Jersey City, New Jersey), Trenton (the capitol), and Burlington developed. Many others started themselves upon the west bank of the Hudson. New Jersey was part of the area known at this time as New Netherland. In 1664, the England took New Netherland from the Dutch and added it to their colonies. This part was renamed New Jersey after an island in the English Channel known as Jersey. New Jersey took part in the American Revolutionary War, and was a scene of battles. On Christmas in 1776, George Washington army entered New Jersey to attack British soldiers at Trenton and Battle of Princeton. The American army won, in two small but famous battles that were important in boosting American morale. Later, the rebels drove the British residents out of Princeton, New Jersey and for a time established a national capital there. New Jersey was the third state to join the US and the first to approve the Bill of Rights. ==Counties== New Jersey has 21 counties: {| class="wikitable sortable" cellpadding="1" style="margin:auto; border:#88a; background:#f7f8ff; text-align:center;" |- style="background:#ccf;" | style="vertical-align: bottom;"|County | style="vertical-align: bottom;" |FIPS Code | style="vertical-align: bottom;" | County Seat | style="vertical-align: bottom;" | Created | style="vertical-align: bottom;" | Formed from | style="vertical-align: bottom;" class="unsortable"| Named for | style="vertical-align: bottom;" | Population (2005) | style="vertical-align: bottom;" | Area | style="vertical-align: bottom;" class="unsortable"|Map |} ==References== Category:New Jersey Category:1787 establishments in the United States
