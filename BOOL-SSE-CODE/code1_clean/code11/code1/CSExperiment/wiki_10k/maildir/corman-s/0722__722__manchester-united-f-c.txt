Club Event program and Scarf in the 1960s had a devil on them. It became part of the club crest in 1970. The club added the crest to the front of the shirt in 1971. Newton Heath's uniform in 1879 has been Document as 'white with blue cord'. This was four years before the club played its first match in a competition. A 1892 photograph of the Newton Heath team seems to show the players wearing red-and-white Quarter shirts and navy blue Knickerbockers (clothing).Barnes et al. (2001), p. 48. Between 1894 and 1896, the players wore green and gold shirts. In 1896, these changed to white shirts. They were worn with navy blue shorts. When the club name changed in 1902, the club changed to red shirts, white shorts and black socks. This became the normal Manchester United home kit (the shirt, shorts and socks). The kit did not change very much until 1922. The club then used white shirts with a dark red "V" around the neck. This was similar to the shirt worn in the 1909 FA Cup Final. This stayed as part of the home kits until 1927. For a period in 1934, the cherry (red) and white hooped (with large horizontal Stripe) change shirt (used when the home shirt was too similar to the other team's) became the home shirt. The season after, the players used the red shirt after the club finished 20th in the Second Division and the hooped shirt became the change shirt again.

Starting in 1997–98, United usually used white socks for European games. These matches are usually played during the week in the evening. The white socks help players see the other players in their teams more easily. For 2018–19, black shorts and red socks became the main choice for the home kit. As of 2020, the home kit is a red shirt with the trademark Adidas three stripes in red on the Shoulder, white shorts and black socks. The Manchester United away kit has often been a white shirt, black shorts and white socks. However, this was not always the away kit. The players sometimes used an all-black kit with blue and gold Sewing between 1993 and 1995. They wore navy blue shirts with silver horizontal Pin stripes during the 1999–2000 season.Devlin (2005), p. 157. The 2011–12 away kit had a royal blue chest and sleeves with hoops made of small dark navy blue and black stripes, with black shorts and blue socks. In the 1995–96 season there was an all-Gray away kit. The team only used it for five games. The last time United used it was against Southampton. Alex Ferguson told the team to change into the third kit at half-time. The players said it was difficult to see the other players in their team because the colours were similar to the Audience. United never won a competitive game in that kit. In 2001, to Celebration 100 years as "Manchester United", the club made a wikt:reversible white and gold away kit.

This was close to the railway. At first, the capacity (number of people who could watch) was about 12,000. However, club officials said the wikt:facilities were not good enough for a club that wanted to join The Football League.White, Jim (2008) p. 21. They made it bigger in 1887. In 1891, Newton Heath bought two Grandstand. Each held 1,000 people.James (2008), p. 392. Attendances (the number of people watching) were not recorded for many of the early matches at North Road. However, the highest attendance was about 15,000. This was for a First Division match against Sunderland A.F.C. on 4 March 1893.Shury & Landamore (2005), p. 54. There was a similar attendance for a friendly match (not competitive) against Gorton Villa on 5 September 1889.Shury & Landamore (2005), p. 51. === 1893–1910: Bank Street === In June 1893, Manchester Deans and Canons, the owner of North Road, wikt:eviction the team. They did not think that the club was right to make people pay to get into the ground. The club secretary, A. H.

By the start of the 1893–94 Newton Heath F.C. season, there were two stands. One stand was along the whole length of the pitch on one side. The other stand was behind the goal at the "Bradford end". At the opposite end, the "Clayton end", the Soil had been "built up, thousands thus being provided for". Newton Heath's first league match at Bank Street was against Burnley F.C. on 1 September 1893. 10,000 people watched and Alf Farman scored a hat-trick. Newton Heath's won 3–2. The club added other stands for the next league game against Nottingham Forest F.C., three weeks later. In October 1895, before the visit of Manchester City, the club bought a 2,000-capacity stand. This was from the Broughton Rangers rugby league club. Newton Heath also put up another stand on the "reserved side" (as opposed to the "popular side"). However, bad weather meant only 12,000 could watch the match against Manchester City.Shury & Landamore (2005), p. 24. Bailiff closed the Bank Street ground for a time in 1902. The club captain, Harry Stafford, Fundraising enough money to pay for the club's next away game at Bristol City. He also helped to find a ground at Harpurhey for the next reserves game against Padiham.Shury & Landamore (2005), pp. 33–34.

Within four years, the stadium had Roof on all four sides. It was also able to hold about 50,000 people. Some of them could watch from the viewing gallery on top of the Main Stand. === 1910–present: Old Trafford === Manchester United won its first league title in 1908. It won the FA Cup a year later. Davies decided that the Bank Street was too small for his wikt:ambition. In February 1909, six weeks before the club's first FA Cup title, Old Trafford became the home of Manchester United. The club bought the land for around £60,000. Architect Archibald Leitch had about £30,000 to build the stadium. The original plans were for a capacity of 100,000 people. However, this changed to 77,000 because it was too expensive. Brameld and Smith of Manchester built the stadium. The stadium's record attendance was on 25 March 1939.

Manchester United had to pay £5,000 per year, and a small percentage of gate receipts (tickets sold).White, John (2007), p. 11. The club made the stadium better over the years. It added roofs, first to the Stretford End and then to the North and East Stands. Pillars supported (held) the roofs. This blocked the view of many fans. To make this better, the club built a Cantilever wikt:structure instead. The Stretford End was the last stand to get a cantilevered roof. This was finished before the 1993–94 Manchester United F.C. season started.Barnes et al. (2001), p. 19. The club built four Transmission tower for lighting. Each pylon had 54 individual floodlights. The club used them for the first time on 25 March 1957. The pylons cost £40,000. In 1987, the club stopped using these pylons. They used a new lighting system inside in the roof of each stand instead. This is the same system used today.Barnes et al. (2001), pp. 44–45. The Taylor Report said that clubs needed to have a stadium with only seats. This meant that Old Trafford could only have 44,000 fans at the same time in 1993. In 1995, the North Stand changed into three wikt:tier (levels). After this, about 55,000 people could watch the games. At the end of the 1998–99 season, the club built second tiers for the East and West Stands. 67,000 people could watch the games after this. Between July 2005 and May 2006, they added 8,000 more seats with second tiers in the north-west and north-east quadrants (corners). Fans used some of the new seating for the first time on 26 March 2006. This set a new attendance record of 69,070. This was the most for a Premier League match. The record slowly went up. It was highest on 31 March 2007. 76,098 fans saw Manchester United beat Blackburn Rovers F.C. 4–1. Only 114 seats (0.15 percent of the total capacity of 76,212) were empty.

File:Turkish_Airlines_Boeing_737-800_ManU_Karakas.jpg in Manchester United livery]] Many say that the strength of Manchester United's global brand is thanks to Matt Busby. He built the team again after the Munich air disaster.Barnes et al. (2001), p. 52. Bobby Charlton and Nobby Stiles (both won the World Cup with England in 1966), Denis Law and George Best played in this team. The team had an attacking style of play and "captured the imagination of the English footballing public".Hamil (2008), p. 116. Busby's team also became linked to the Liberalism of Western world during the 1960s. George Best was known as the "Fifth Beatle" because of his Hairstyle. He was the first footballer to be important in the media away from football. Manchester United was the second English football club to Initial public offering on the London Stock Exchange in 1991. The club had a lot of money after this. This helped with its Commercial management. The club focused on both commercial and sporting success. This brought high Profit whereas the football industry often brings large losses.Hamil (2008), p. 124. The Manchester United brand became stronger because the media were very interested in player's personal lives. The most famous example is David Beckham (who also made his own wikt:global brand). This attention often makes people more interested in the football. This gives the club more chances for Sponsor, which becomes more valuable when it is on television often.Hamil (2008), p. 121. During his time with the club, Beckham became more popular across Asia. This was very important for the club's commercial success in that part of the world. When a club finishes in a better position in the league it gets more money from television Transaction. This means that if a teams wins more matches, the club also gets more money.

The club's first trophy was the Manchester Cup. It won this as Newton Heath LYR in 1886.Shury & Landamore (2005), p. 8. In 1908, the club won its first league title. It won the FA Cup for the first time the year after. Since then, it has won a record 20 first division titles. This includes a record 13 Premier League titles. Its 13 FA Cups is second only to Arsenal F.C. (14). They have also played a record 30 times in the FA Community Shield (which used to be called the FA Charity Shield). This is a game at the start of each season between the winners of the league and the FA Cup from the season before. Out of those 30 games, Manchester United won 21. This counts four times when the match was a draw and the two clubs shared the trophy. The club won a lot under manager Matt Busby. This started with the FA Cup in 1948 FA Cup Final. The high point was becoming the first English club to win the UEFA Champions League in 1968 European Cup Final, and winning five league titles in the years before. However, the club's best decade was in the 1990s when Alex Ferguson was the manager. In the 1990s, he helped the club win five league titles, four FA Cups, one Football League Cup, five Charity Shields (one shared), one UEFA Champions League, one UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, one UEFA Super Cup and one Intercontinental Cup (football). The club also won the Double (association football) (winning the Premier League and FA Cup in the same season) three times during the 1990s. Before their first double in 1993–94, it had only happened five times in English football. When they won a second double in 1995–96, it was called the "Double Double". They were the first team to win the double twice. They won the European Cup (now the UEFA Champions League) for a second time in 1999 UEFA Champions League Final, and the Premier League and FA Cup. This means they became the first English club to win the Treble (association football). That Champions League title meant they could play in the Intercontinental Cup (which doesn't exist anymore). They also won this. They are the only British team to win the Intercontinental Cup. They won another Champions League title in 2008 UEFA Champions League Final. This meant they qualified for the 2008 FIFA Club World Cup. They also won this cup. Until 2019, they were the only British team to win that competition. Liverpool then won it in 2019. The club's won the UEFA Europa League in 2016–17 UEFA Europa League. By winning that title, United became the fifth club to win the "UEFA club competition records and statistics#List of teams to have won the three main European club competitions" of UEFA Champions League, UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, and UEFA Europa League after Juventus F.C., AFC Ajax, FC Bayern Munich and Chelsea F.C.. The club's won its 2022–23 EFL Cup in February 2023. Its most recent trophy is the FA Cup. The club won 2–1 against Manchester City on 25 May 2024. {| class="wikitable plainrowheaders" style="text-align:center" |+Manchester United's honours ! style="width:1%" |Type ! style="width:5%" |Competition ! style="width:1%" |Titles ! style="width:21%" |Seasons |- | rowspan="5" |'''Domestic''' ! scope="col" |Football League First Division/Premier LeagueUpon its formation in 1992, the Premier League became the top tier of Football in England; the English Football League Football League First Division and Football League Second Division then became the second and third tiers, respectively.

The season after, it joined the first division, the FA Women's Super League. == Related pages == * List of Manchester United F.C. players == Notes == == References == Category:1878 establishments in England Category:Manchester United F.C.
