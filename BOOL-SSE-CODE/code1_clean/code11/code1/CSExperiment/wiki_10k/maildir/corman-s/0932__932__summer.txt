In some places, summer is the wettest season (with the most rain), and in other places, it is a dry season. Four seasons are found in areas which are not too hot or too cold. Summer happens to the north and south sides of the Earth at opposite times of the year. In the north part of the world, summer takes place between the months of June and September, and in the south part of the world, it takes place between December and March. This is because when the north part of the Earth points towards the Sun, the south part points away. Many people in rich countries travel in summer, to seaside resorts, beaches, Camping or Picnic. In some countries, they celebrate things in the summer as well as enjoying cool drinks. Other countries get snow in the summer just like winter. Category:Seasons
