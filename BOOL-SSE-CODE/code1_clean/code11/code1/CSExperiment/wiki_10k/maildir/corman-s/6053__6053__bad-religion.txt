Subject: Bad Religion
'''Bad Religion''' is an United States band that plays punk rock music. They were created in Southern California in 1979 by Jay Bentley (bass), Greg Graffin (vocals), Brett Gurewitz (guitars) and Jay Ziskrout (drums). People think that they brought back punk rock and helped pop-punk bands during the late 1980s. Since they were created 44 years ago, Bad Religion has had a lot of members come and go. Greg Graffin is the only person that's been in the band the whole time but today there are three of the four members that were in the group when it started. Today, Bad Religion has fourteen studio albums, two Extended play, three compilation albums, one live album, and two DVDs. Some critics think that their 1988 album ''Suffer (album)'' is one of the most important punk rock albums of all time,. People began to notice Bad Religion after their 1993 album ''Recipe for Hate'', which was number 14 on Billboard (magazine)'s Heatseekers chart. Their next album, ''Stranger Than Fiction'', had the band's well-known hits "21st Century (Digital Boy)" and "Infected (song)", did well and was the only Bad Religion album to get gold status in the United States. Brett Gurewitz left in 1994. Bad Religion was not as well known after that and did not sell many albums until ''The Process of Belief'' in 2002. Brett Gurewitz came back in 2001, and worked with them on their four most recent albums. The band is planning to make another album in 2012. They are known for their smart use of style, comparisons, word choice, imagery, and voice harmonies (which they call "oozin aahs.) Lyrics sometimes have to do with their emotions or their opinion of society. Greg Graffin called his influences "pop sounding rock tunes that were not necessarily commercial." In 1981, the band released their eponymous debut Extended play on the newly-formed label, Epitaph Records, which was and continues to be managed and owned by Gurewitz. 1982 saw the release of their first full-length album, ''How Could Hell Be Any Worse?'', gaining the band a sizable following. During the recording of ''How Could Hell Be Any Worse?'', Jay Ziskrout left the band and was replaced by Peter Finestone. ===''Into the Unknown'', ''Back to the Known'' and hiatus (1983-1985)=== In 1983, the band released ''Into the Unknown (Bad Religion album)'', a keyboard-driven progressive rock album that was enormously unpopular with the band's core fanbase. It is now officially out of print, after almost all of the 10,000 copies were surreptitiously sold out of the warehouse they were being stored in by Gurewitz's ex-girlfriend, Suzy Shaw (who currently runs Bomp Records). The record has since become a collectors item, and has also gained acceptance from some fans. It can be seen going for more than 100 dollars on Ebay. Also in 1983, the Mystic Records compilation album "The Sound Of Hollywood, Vol. 2" was released featuring two Bad Religion songs- "Every Day" and "Waiting For The Fire" which continued in the mellow acoustic/keyboard direction of the previous album. These songs are exclusive to this vinyl-only release which has been out of print for many years. In 1984, Greg Hetson of The Circle Jerks fame, who had played the guitar solo for "Part III" on ''How Could Hell Be Any Worse?'', teamed up with Graffin on the song "Running Fast" for the soundtrack of the film ''Desperate Teenage Lovedolls''. Originally credited to ''Greg Greg'' on the initial release, the 1997 CD reissue lists the artist as ''Greg Graffin and Greg Hetson''. Soon after, Graffin reassembled Bad Religion with Hetson replacing Gurewitz, who had gone into rehab for his drug problem. Bad Religion returned to a somewhat mellower, rock and roll version of their original sound with the ''Back to the Known'' EP, but disbanded temporarily soon after. In 1985, Brett Gurewitz released a 5-song EP on Epitaph Records under the name ''The Seeing Eye Gods''. This psychedelic influenced record is long out of print and has never been released on CD. ===Reunion and ''Suffer'' (1986-1988) === Bad Religion slowly reformed in 1986 out of the ''Back to the Known'' lineup when Greg Graffin called Jay Bentley and asked him to return. Bentley's response was tentative, but after being assured that the setlist consisted mostly of tracks from ''How Could Hell Be Any Worse?'', he agreed to return for one show, and ended up staying on because he had so much fun. A freshly rehabilitated Gurewitz was eventually convinced to come back aboard, and with Pete Finestone returning on drums and Greg Hetson on second guitar, Bad Religion was back. The reunited band released ''Suffer (album)'' in 1988, cementing their comeback in the punk community. Not only is this album often cited as one of their very best by fans, but it is credited with "saving" the Southern California punk rock scene by fans and Bad Religion's contemporaries alike. ===''No Control'', ''Against the Grain'' and ''Generator'' (1989-1992)=== During the ''Suffer'' tour in 1988, Bad Religion began writing "album's worth of material" and debuted a new song called "21st Century (Digital Boy)". After the ''Suffer'' tour ended in early 1989, Bad Religion immediately decided to commence work on their next album and entered the Westbeach Recorders studio in June of that year to record it. The resulting album, ''No Control (Bad Religion album)'', was released in November 1989, and ended up selling more than 50,000 copies. By the time it was released, the band had become one of the most critically-praised hardcore punk bands of the time, in spite of a lack of mainstream success. Bad Religion's hardcore punk style continued with their next album, ''Against the Grain (Bad Religion album)'', which was released in 1990. While the album still did not break the group into mainstream audiences, it was the first 100,000 seller, and showed how quickly they were growing. The track "21st Century (Digital Boy)" off the album, which was originally intended to appear on ''No Control'', is generally regarded the band's most well-known song, and is often a staple at live shows. Bad Religion's sixth album, ''Generator (album)'', was released in 1992. Before recording sessions for ''Generator'' commenced, drummer Pete Finestone left Bad Religion early in 1991 to focus on his other band, The Fishermen, which had signed with a major label, and Bobby Schayer joined the band as his replacement. To coincide with the band's success, Bad Religion released a compilation album, ''80-85'', in 1991. It is a repackaging of their debut album, ''How Could Hell Be Any Worse?'', their two EPs, ''Bad Religion (EP)'' and ''Back to the Known'' and the band's three track contributions to the ''Public Service (EP)'' EP. This compilation did not include ''Into the Unknown (Bad Religion album)''. ''80-85'' is now out of print and has been replaced by the 2004 re-issued version of ''How Could Hell Be Any Worse?'' with the same track listings. === Mainstream success (1993-1995) === With alternative rock and grunge breaking into the mainstream, Bad Religion left Epitaph Records for Atlantic Records and quickly re-released their seventh full-length studio album ''Recipe for Hate'' (1993) on the major label. Also in 1993, the band recorded the song "Leaders and Followers" for the soundtrack for the Kevin Smith (film maker) film, ''Clerks''. Their next album, 1994's ''Stranger Than Fiction (album)'', subsequently became their most successful release, scoring hits with "Infected" and a re-recording of "21st Century (Digital Boy)", which was originally released on ''Against the Grain''. To date, ''Stranger Than Fiction'' remains another one of Bad Religion's best known albums, with sales continuing fifteen years after its release. On March 4, 1998, it also became the band's first RIAA certified gold record for sales of over half a million in the United States. Before the release of ''Stranger Than Fiction'', Gurewitz left the band. He officially cited the reason for his departure as the increasing amount of time he was needed at Epitaph as The Offspring became one of the biggest bands of the mid-1990s, but it was well known that his departure was not on good terms. Gurewitz, along with many fans, accused the band of selling out for leaving Epitaph to seek greater financial success despite the fact that Gurewitz was making millions off of The Offspring alone. As tensions increased, Graffin would sing alternate lyrics during concerts such as "I want to know where Brett gets his crack" or "I want to know why Gurewitz cracked," on the song "Stranger Than Fiction". These barbs referred to Gurewitz's struggles with crack, heroin and other addictions which plagued him for years. Brett discussed his drug use in an interview on the band's ''Suffer (album)'' tour documentary, ''Along the Way'', and is now clean and sober. In response, Gurewitz recorded a song with his new band The Daredevils (band) entitled "Hate You", reportedly directed towards Jay Bentley. Gurewitz was replaced as a guitarist by Brian Baker (musician), a former member of bands such as Minor Threat and Dag Nasty. Since Greg Graffin and Gurewitz had split songwriting duties, Graffin was now Bad Religion's primary songwriter. === Sans Gurewitz period (1996-2000) === Bad Religion continued touring and recording without Brett Gurewitz and released three more albums for Atlantic, starting with ''The Gray Race'' (1996), produced by former Cars frontman Ric Ocasek. The album would score Bad Religion a minor U.S. radio hit with the song "A Walk" as well as the European release of "Punk Rock Song" (sung in both English and German). The band would find its greatest success in Europe, where the album would reach the German music charts at #6 and score the band their first European gold record for sales in Scandinavia alone.

For ''The New America'' (2000), Todd Rundgren, an early musical inspiration for Graffin, was brought in to produce. "Todd was kind of an underground sensation back in 1974. Here's a guy who was making pop music but in a way that you wouldn't hear on the radio. So much of my early musical identity was wrapped up in the way he conducted himself." In the summer of 1999 they set out on a three month US arena tour opening for Blink 182. Unfortunately, the experience might not have been all that Greg and the rest of the band might have hoped. Interest in recording the record waned, due to Rundgren's poor attitude. Jay Bentley reflects on this by saying, "I didn't feel we were going anywhere and so did Greg. Todd didn't like Greg and that made Greg so mad! He met his idol and he was a jerk! I don't think Todd gave a shit about anything." Meanwhile, Bobby Schayer left the band following a serious shoulder injury and was replaced by Brooks Wackerman (Suicidal Tendencies). Bad Religion departed from Atlantic Records in 2001 and returned to Epitaph. === Reunion with Gurewitz (2001-2004) === In 2001, Brett Gurewitz rejoined the band in time to record ''The Process Of Belief'' (2002). Graffin states, "there was a little bit of disappointment on my part when he left the band, but we never had any serious acrimony between the two of us. I can't say the same for the rest of the band. But he and I, being the songwriters from way back, we really wanted to try again." Their next album, ''The Empire Strikes First'', was released in June 2004. Both albums are widely regarded by fans and critics as a return to form for the band, as opposed to their time on Atlantic. The band also re-released digitally-remastered versions of several of their early albums on Epitaph Records, including ''How Could Hell Be Any Worse?'', ''Suffer'', ''No Control'', ''Against the Grain'', and ''Generator''. The ''How Could Hell Be Any Worse?'' re-issue, though reclaiming the original title of the band's debut LP, contained all of the same material as the previously issued ''80-85'' compilation, including their first EP, the ''Public Service (EP)'' EP (with different versions of the songs Bad Religion, Slaves, and Drastic Actions than the self-titled EP) and the "Back To The Known" EP. ===''New Maps of Hell'' (2005-2008)=== File:Bad Religion 2005-6-22.jpg On March 7, 2006, a live DVD, ''Live at the Palladium (Bad Religion DVD)'' was released. This DVD featured a live show performed in late 2004 at the Hollywood Palladium, as well as extensive interviews, several music videos, and a photo gallery. During one of the interview segments, guitarist Brett Gurewitz said the band's next album would be a double length release, but this turned out not to be the case. Greg Graffin released his second solo album, ''Cold as the Clay'', on July 11, 2006. Bad Religion's fourteenth (and most recent) studio album, ''New Maps of Hell'', was released on July 10, 2007. On June 29 of that year (Greg Hetson's 46th birthday), Epitaph Records started selling ''New Maps of Hell'' at the Warped Tour in Pomona, California. The album was a commercial success and spawned two hit singles "Honest Goodbye" and "New Dark Ages", and as a result, ''New Maps of Hell'' reached number 35 on the ''Billboard 200'', marking Bad Religion's highest ever chart position. Bad Religion also joined the 2007 Warped Tour to support the album. Hetson formed a Supergroup (music) band called Black President (band), consisting of Charlie Paulson (from Goldfinger (band)), Jason Christopher, Wade Youman (both from Unwritten Law) and Christian Martucci (from Dee Dee Ramone).In the January issue of the magazine Alternative Press, it was revealed that their 14th album would be released in late spring 2007. In early March 2008, Bad Religion played several-night residences at House of Blues venues in Southern California as well as Las Vegas, Nevada. They also played at the KROQ Weenie Roast (y Fiesta) on May 17 along such bands as Flobots, Metallica, The Offspring, Pennywise (band), Rise Against and Scars on Broadway. Following that, they performed four European festival appearances in May 2008 and June 2008. On July 8, 2008, Bad Religion released their first-ever deluxe edition CD, a reissue of 2007's ''New Maps of Hell''. The deluxe version includes the original 16 song CD, along with seven new acoustic tracks recorded by Graffin (vocals) and Gurewitz (guitars/back vocals). Three of the acoustic songs are new, written specifically for this release; the other four tracks are new acoustic versions of BR songs. The release also includes a DVD with an hour-long live performance, music videos and behind-the-scenes footage. ===Next album (2009-present)=== In June 2008, Jay Bentley said in an interview at the Pinkpop Festival in Landgraaf, Netherlands that Gurewitz had already begun writing new material for the next Bad Religion album. Bentley stated that the band was planning to return to the studio after Graffin teaches UCLA to start work on the follow-up to ''New Maps of Hell'' planned for a June 2009 release. However, according to a December 2008 report on the fan site The Bad Religion Page, Bentley revealed that due to Bad Religion's upcoming touring commitments for 2009, the band would not have a chance to record their new album until around the end of the year, for an expected 2010 release date. Their new album, entitled ''The Dissent of Man'', will be released on September 28, 2010.--> ==Lyrics and ideology== Most of Bad Religion's lyrics are written by Greg Graffin or Brett Gurewitz. Sometimes, but often, they will co-write a song. Other band members, such as Jay Bentley, also write songs, but very rarely. Brett Gurewitz says he tried to copy The Germs singer Darby Crash early on in Bad Religion's career. "He wrote some intelligent stuff, and didn't shy away from the vocabulary, which I thought was cool." Bad Religion also uses voice harmonies. The Adolescents influenced them with their three-part voice harmonies. Bassist Jay Bentley says, "Seeing The Adolescents live, it was so brilliant. So, in a way, the Adolescents influenced us into saying we can do it too, because look, they're doing it." ===Social and political issues=== Many of Bad Religion's songs are about what they think are social problems, but they do not blame causes of these problems to any single person or group. Greg Graffin thinks that the politics in the United States can make it hard to talk about the problems. The band is sometimes direct about the things they want to say. Brett Gurewitz said he was angry at former U.S. president George W. Bush and that ''The Empire Strikes First'' is about him. "Our whole album is dedicated to getting Bush out of office. I'm not a presidential scholar but I don't think you'll find a worse president in the history of the United States. He's probably one of the worst leaders in the history of world leaders. I just hate the guy." ===Religion=== Despite the name of the band, the members say they are not anti-religious. Greg Graffin says that more often than not, the band likes to use religion to represent anything that does not let a person be free. Their songs are more about being against conformity than against religion or God. But Greg Graffin is an atheist. He helped write the book 'Is Belief in God Good, Bad or Irrelevant?' The band's bassist Jay Bentley has stated that he has spiritual beliefs. Brett Gurewitz is a "provisional Deism." ==Band members== ===Current members=== * Greg Graffin – lead vocals, piano, synthesizer, acoustic guitar, songwriter (1979 – 1984, 1986 – present) * Brett Gurewitz – lead guitar, rhythm guitar, backing vocals, songwriter (1979 – 1983, 1986 – 1994, 2001 – present) * Jay Bentley – bass guitar, backing vocals (1979 – 1982, 1986 – present) * Greg Hetson – lead guitar, rhythm guitar (1984, 1986 – present) * Brian Baker (musician) – lead guitar, rhythm guitar, backing vocals (1994 – present) * Brooks Wackerman – drums, percussion (2001 – present) ==Discography== {| class="wikitable" |- !'''Year''' !'''Album''' !'''US Chart position''' !'''Vocals''' !colspan="3"|'''Guitars''' !'''Bass''' !'''Drums''' |- |1982 |''How Could Hell Be Any Worse?''Albums widely considered to be among Bad Religion's most important works. |rowspan=6|Never charted |rowspan=16|Greg Graffin |rowspan=8|Brett Gurewitz |colspan="2" rowspan=2| |Jay Bentley |Pete Finestone / Jay Ziskrout |- |1983 |''Into the Unknown'' |Paul Dedona |Davy Goldman |- |1988 |''Suffer (album)'' |rowspan=14|Greg Hetson |rowspan=6| |rowspan=14|Jay Bentley |rowspan=3|Pete Finestone |- |1989 |''No Control''| |- |1990 |''Against the Grain'' |- |1992 |''Generator (Bad Religion album)'' |rowspan=6|Bobby Schayer |- |1993 |''Recipe for Hate'' |#14 (Heatseekers) |- |1994 |''Stranger Than Fiction'' |#87 |- |1996 |''The Gray Race'' |#56 |rowspan=3| |rowspan=9|Brian Baker (musician) |- |1998 |''No Substance'' |#78 |- |2000 |''The New America'' |#88 |- |2002 |''The Process of Belief'' |#49 |rowspan=5|Brett Gurewitz |rowspan=5|Brooks Wackerman |- |2004 |''The Empire Strikes First'' |#40 |- |2007 |''New Maps of Hell'' |#35 |- |2010 |''The Dissent of Man'' | #35 |- |2013 | ''True North (album)'' | |} ==Other websites== * [http://www.badreligion.com/ Official Website] * [http://www.thebrpage.net/ The Bad Religion Page] Fan website, established 1995. * [http://badreligion.ipshit.com/ Bad Religion Videos] Live videos and Bootlegs ==References== Category:Bad Religion Category:1980s American music groups Category:1990s American music groups Category:2000s American music groups Category:2010s American music groups Category:American punk bands Category:Musical groups from Los Angeles Category:Musical groups established in 1979 Category:1979 establishments in California Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1984 Category:1984 disestablishments in the United States Category:1980s disestablishments in California Category:Musical groups established in 1985 Category:1985 establishments in California Category:1979 in the United States Category:American pop music groups Category:Atlantic Records artists Category:Hardcore punk Category:Musical groups established in 1980 Category:Musicians from California
