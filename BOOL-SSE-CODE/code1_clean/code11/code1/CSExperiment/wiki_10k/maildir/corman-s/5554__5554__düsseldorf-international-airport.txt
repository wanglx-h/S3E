It is eight kilometres from Düsseldorf. The airport has the IATA Airport Code DUS. There is one other airport named "Düsseldorf Express Airport, Mönchengladbach", but that is only a continental airport and has only a few lines, mostly private jets. This article is very old. Needs updating! The international airport supports flights to 180 destinations on four continents and hosts 70 airlines. The airport has 800 takeoffs and landings per day. The airport was opened on April 19, 1927, after two years of construction. However, the first aircraft to land in northern Düsseldorf was the Zeppelin LZ-III in 1909. On April 11, 1996 there was a fire in the airport, probably caused by welding work on the roof. 17 people were killed, mostly due to smoke inhalation. The terminal building was badly damaged, and was closed for five years. By July 1, 2001 it had been nearly completely re-built and was re-opened. A suspended monorail connects the terminal building with the InterCity and InterCityExpress train station (High speed and extremely high speed trains). The so-called ''SkyTrain'' travels the 2.5 kilometers between the terminal and station at a maximum speed of 50km/h. It started operation in 2002, replacing a shuttle bus service, and is not free of charge to use. == Airlines serving Düsseldorf International Airport == Currently, the following airlines operate routes to and from Düsseldorf International Airport: * Aegean Airlines * Aer Lingus (Dublin) * Aero Lloyd * Aeroflight (Catania, Nador, Tivat) * Aeroflot (Moscow Domodedovo) * Air Adriatic * Air Botnia * Air Europa * Air France (Lyon, Nice, Paris) * Air Malta * Air Via Bulgarian Airways * Alitalia (Milan-Malpensa, Rome) * AMC Aviation * Atlasjet International (Ankara) * Austrian Airlines (Vienna) * Balkan Air * BH Airlines * Bluewings (Ankara, Istanbul, Izmir) * British Airways (London-Heathrow) * British Airways Citiexpress (Birmingham, Manchester) * Bulgarian Air Charter (Burgas, Varna) * Cimber Air * Cirrus Airlines * Condor Flugdienst (Arrecife, Heraklion, Las Palmas, Palma) * Croatia Airlines (Split) * Czech Airlines * dba (Berlin-Tegel, Lamezia, Munich, Nürnberg) * Delta Air Lines (Atlanta, beginning March 2006) * Denim Airlines * Deutsche BA * Egyptair (Cairo) * El Al * Emirates (Bombay, Delhi, Dubai, Hong Kong, Johannesburg, Osaka, Perth, Singapore) * Eurocypria Airlines * Eurowings * Finnair (Helsinki) * Fly Air * Freebird Airlines * Germania Airlines (Lamezia, Zadar) * Germania Express (Sarajevo, Zadar) * German Wings (Berlin-Schonefeld) * Hapag-Lloyd Airlines (Bodrum, Catania, Fuerteventura, Heraklion, Palma) * Hola Airlines * Iberia Airlines (Madrid) * Islandsflug-Icebird * Karthago Airlines * Kibris Turkish * KLM Cityhopper (Amsterdam) * LOT Polish (Warsaw) * LTE International * Luftfahrtgesellschaft Walter (Erfert) * Lufthansa (Atlanta, Barcelona, Berlin-Tegel, Birmingham, Boston, Bucharest, Budapest, Chicago, Denver, Dresdon, Frankfurt, Geneva, Hamburg, Houston, Jersey, Leipzig-Halle, London-City, London-Heathrow, Los Angeles, Lyon, Manchester, Milan-Malpensa, Montreal, Munich, Newark, Nurnberg, Paris, Portland, Prague, Rome, San Francisco, Seattle, Stockholm, Stuttgart, Toronto, Turin, Zürich) * Macedonian Airlines (Ohrid) * Mahan Air (Bangkok, Delhi) * Middle East Airlines Liban * MNG Airlines (Bodrum) * Montenegro Airlines * Nouvelair Tunisie (Monastir) * Onur Air (Ankara) * Pegasus Airlines (Bodrum) * Privatair * Rossiya * Royal Air Maroc (Nador) * Scandinavian Airlines System (Copenhagen) * Shorouk Air * Sky Airlines * Styrian Spirit * SunExpress (Antalya, Bodrum) * Swiss International Airlines (Geneva, Zürich) * S7 * TAROM (Bucharest) * Thomas Cook Airlines * Tunisair * Turkish Airlines (Ankara, Istanbul, Izmir) * Viking Airlines * Vueling Airlines (Barcelona) * White Eagle Airlines * World Focus Airlines (Ankara) Before September 11 Düsseldorf International Airport had many flights from the United States.
