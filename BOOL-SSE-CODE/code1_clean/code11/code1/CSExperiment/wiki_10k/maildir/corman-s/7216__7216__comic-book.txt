Woodcut engraving was a cheaper type of illustration widely used in the 19th century. These are important because they created an understanding that illustrations are sometimes just as important as words. The first comic strip appeared in France in 1889, and in the U.S.A. in 1897.Couperie, Pierre and Horn, Maurice C. 1968. ''A history of the comic strip''.
