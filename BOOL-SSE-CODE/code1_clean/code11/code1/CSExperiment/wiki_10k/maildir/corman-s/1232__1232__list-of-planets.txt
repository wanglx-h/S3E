Subject: List of planets
This is a list of two types of planets: standard planets and dwarf planets, in the Solar System. == Planets in the Solar System == * Terrestrial planets **Mercury (planet) – The planet with the second highest temperature in the Solar System and the closest planet to the Sun. ** Venus – The warmest planet. Sometimes called "Earth's twin" because Venus and Earth are very similar. ** Earth – The only planet that is known to have life. It has one natural satellite, the Moon. ** Mars – Sometimes called the "red planet" and "the brother of Earth". * Giant planets **Jupiter – The largest planet in the Solar System. ** Saturn – Sixth planet from the Sun. It has giant Rings of Saturn around it. ** Uranus - Seventh planet from the Sun. It has 11 rings around it. ** Neptune – The farthest planet that we know from the Sun. == Hypothetical planets == * Vulcan (hypothetical planet) – A hypothetical planet thought to be between the Sun and Mercury (planet) * Giant impact hypothesis – A planet which some think crashed into Earth and created the Moon. * Planet V – A hypothetical planet beyond Mars. * Phaeton (planet) – A planet which exploded and created Ceres (dwarf planet). * Antichthon – A hypothetical planet which has a opposite aspect of the Earth. * Krypton – A hypothetical planet between Jupiter and Saturn * Planets beyond Neptune – A planets beyond Neptune * Tyche (planet) – a hypothetical planet thought to be found in the edges of the Oort cloud. * Planet Nine – a hypothetical planets beyond Neptune. It has not been found, but some astronomers think its gravity pulls on the orbits of many dwarf planets. It is thought to be a gas giant. * Planet 10 – A hypothetical planets beyond Neptune. == Dwarf planets == === Consensus === * Ceres is the largest asteroid (not to mention plutinos) in the Solar System's main asteroid belt. * 90482 Orcus crosses paths with the formal planet Pluto * Haumea (dwarf planet) is shaped like an egg. * Makemake (dwarf planet) crosses paths with Eris. * 50000 Quaoar has two rings. * 90377 Sedna has the largest orbital period, aphelion, semi-major axis and perihelion of any planet. * 225088 Gonggong also crosses paths with Eris. * Eris (dwarf planet) follows the most Orbital eccentricity of any planet. === Dwarf planet candidates === * 120347 Salacia * 307261 Máni * 55565 Aya * 208996 Achlys * 2013 FY27 * Varda * 28978 Ixion * 20000 Varuna * G!kùn'hómdimà * Chaos * 2014 UZ224 "Deedee" * Dziewanna * 2002 UX25 * 2018 VG18 "Farout" * 2018 AG37 "Farfarout" * 2002 TC302 * 2012 VP113 "Biden" * 38628 Huya * 10 Hygiea * (15874) 1996 TL66 * (15788) 1993 SB * 2002 TX300 * 47171 Lempo * 79360 Sila-Nunam * 148780 Altjira * Praamzius * Mbabamwanawaresa * 65489 Ceto * 541132 Leleākūhonua * 53311 Deucalion * 2011 KT19 ==Exoplanets== ==Definition of a planet== Technically, there was never a scientific definition of the term ''planet'' before 2006. When the Greeks observed the sky thousands of years ago, they discovered objects that acted differently than stars. These points of light seemed to wander around the sky throughout the year. The term "planet" derives from the Greek word "planets" - wanderer. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) convened a Planet Definition Committee, deliberated, and ultimately reached a consensus on a new definition of a planet which leaves us with the eight planets we today consider to comprise the Solar System (thus the exit of Pluto). That new definition: " A “planet” is a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the Sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, and (c) has cleared the neighborhood around its orbit [meaning: 'there are no other bodies in its path that it must sweep up as it goes around the Sun'.]" Category:Planets Category:Astronomy lists
