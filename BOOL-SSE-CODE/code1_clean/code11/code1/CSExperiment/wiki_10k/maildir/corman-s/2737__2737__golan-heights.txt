The United Nations has voted to ask Israel to pull its troops out of the Golan Heights. Syria and Israel still have not signed a peace treaty from that war, mostly because of the issue of the Golan. They almost reached a peace deal but they could not agree on where to draw the line, and what Syria would have to do in return. The Golan Heights and Mount Hermon was annexation by Israel in 1981. On the western edge of the Golan Heights is a range of dormant volcano and extinct volcano volcanos. In January 2013, the Israeli government said it planned to build a wall along the eastern edges of the Golan Heights, on its ceasefire line with Syria.[http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/03/20/17360084-israel-becomes-a-fortress-nation-as-it-walls-itself-off-from-the-arab-spring Israel becomes a fortress nation as it walls itself off from the Arab Spring], NBC News, March 20, 2013. == Maps == File:Golan 92.jpg|Map of the Golan Heights.
