File:Templo Mayor in Mexico-Tenochtitlan 16th century (illustration 1900).jpg '''Tenochtitlan''' was the capital city of the Aztec Empire. The Aztecs built Tenochtitlan around 1325, right on a lake called Lake Texcoco.Marty, Lisa (2006). Ancient Aztecs. Lorenz Educational Press. p. 9. . As the Empire grew, so did Tenochtitlan. By the early 16th century, at least 200,000 people lived in the city. This made Tenochtitlan the largest city in the Americas before Christopher Columbus arrived. ==Center of the Aztec Empire== Tenochtitlan was the center of the Aztec government and Aztec mythology. It was also a very big trade center. When the Spanish arrived in 1519, they guessed that 60,000 people came to the market in Tenochtitlan every day. People bought and sold many things there, including slaves (prisoner of war from states the Aztecs had taken over). The entire city was decorated with art, architecture, and stone sculptures. ==The Great Temple== The city had a huge pyramid called the Templo Mayor (Great Temple). At the top of the Temple, there were two small rooms. In these rooms, the Aztecs human sacrifice to two of their most important gods: ''Huitzilopochtli'', the god of war and the sun, and ''Tlaloc'', the rain god. The Aztecs believed that if they did not feed their deitys blood, the gods would wither and die, causing Apocalypse as they knew it. ==Agriculture== The Aztecs had created canals all across the city. By bringing water to Aztec crops, these canals made it possible for the Aztecs to grow much more food than they normally could have. The Aztecs had also made levees to protect the city from flooding, and reservoirs for fresh water. The Aztecs also built chinampas (small rectangular crops floating on lake beds) so that they could create more food to feed the thousands of people who lived around Tenochtitlan. In addition, they built waterways and dams so that they could receive fresh water, and block out the salty brackish water.West, Robert C.; & Armillas, Pedro (1950).

Albuquerque, New Mexico: University of New Mexico Press. pp. 2-3. . ==Fall of Tenochtitlan== In 1519, Spain conquistadores led by Hernan Cortes arrived in Tenochtitlan. Cortes was impressed with the city, but still decided to attack it. The Spanish and their Tlaxcalan allies invaded Tenochtitlan, and the city fell in 1521. Mexico City was built over the ruins of Tenochtitlan.Evans, Susan Toby (2005). "The Aztec Palace Under Spanish Rule." In ''The Postclassic to Spanish-Era Transition in Mesoamerica.'' pp. 13-40.
