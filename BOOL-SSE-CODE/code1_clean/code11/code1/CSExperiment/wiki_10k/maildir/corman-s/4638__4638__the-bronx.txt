It is the only borough of New York City not on an island. The name came from Bronck's Farms, owned by a settler called Jonas Bronck. The Bronx was once the southern part of Westchester County, New York, but is now one of the five boroughs of New York City as well as a county in New York State called '''Bronx County'''. The Bronx River flows south out of Yonkers and Mount Vernon, New York, through the middle of The Bronx, and into Long Island Sound.https://www.hudsonriver.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BR_WLIS_RFS_10-29-21.pdf The Bronx is also known for its extreme crime rate in comparison to other parts of New York City.
