Different groups may have different cultures. A culture is passed on to the next generation by learning, whereas genetics are passed on by heredity. Culture is seen in people's writing, religion, music, clothes, cooking and in what they do. The concept of culture is very complicated, and the word has some meanings.Kroeber A.L. and C. Kluckhohn 1952. ''Culture: a critical review of concepts and definitions''. The word 'culture' is most commonly used in three ways. * Excellence of taste in the fine arts and humanities, also known as ''high culture''. * An integrated pattern of human knowledge, belief, and behaviour. * The outlook, attitudes, values, morals, wikt:goal, and customs shared by a society. Most broadly, 'culture' includes all human phenomena which are not purely results of human genetics. The wikt:discipline which investigates cultures is called anthropology, though many other disciplines play a part. == National cultures == Cultures are what make a country unique and interesting. Each country has different cultural activities and cultural rituals. Culture includes material goods, the things the people use and produce. Culture is also the beliefs and values of the people and the ways they think about and understand the world and their own lives. Different country have different cultures. For example, some older Japanese people wear kimonos, arrange flowers in vases, and have Japanese tea ceremony. Some countries oppose some things in their culture, like discrimination or religion. Some countries also have multiple cultures within them. == Regional or non-regional cultures == Culture can also vary within a region, society or sub group. A workplace may have a specific culture that sets it apart from similar workplaces. A region of a country may have a different culture than the rest of the country. For example, in a large country like China or Canada a region may have a distinctive dialect, different types of music, and different types of dances. A group who acts or speaks differently may be said to be, or have, a subculture. Ethnic groups such as the Romani people in Europe have a distinct culture. == Company cultures == Company or other organizations (groups of people) can have a separate culture. Japan manufacturing companies often have a different culture to Western companies; the workday starts with exercise, and the workers are very loyal to the company. Companies in the high-technology sector often have a different culture than other companies. Software and computer companies sometimes allow employees to play games during the workday, or take time off work to relax, because these companies believe that this will help the workers to think better. == Anthropology == ''Anthropology'' is studying human beings and how they relate to each other. An ''anthropologist'' is a person who studies anthropology. Anthropologists study how culture shapes people and their lives. Cultures constantly change as people move and communicate with new groups of people. For example, immigrants (people who move from one country to another) may keep some of their customs and traditions from their old country. By keeping their culture in this way, they bring pieces of their culture to a new place where others begin to experience it. == Related pages == * Tradition * Roerich Pact * Lifestyle == References == == Website == * [http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/Culture_(social) Culture_(social)] -Citizendium Category:Culture Category:Social concepts
