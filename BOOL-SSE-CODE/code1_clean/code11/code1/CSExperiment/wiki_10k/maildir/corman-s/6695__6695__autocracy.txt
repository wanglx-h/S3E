Subject: Autocracy
'''Autocracy''' is a form of government where a single person holds all the power. That person (called an autocrat) can do anything they want Law or Politics. They make all decisions, and there is no separation of powers. They may use propaganda, censorship, and/or violence to control people. Two types of autocracy exist today: Absolute monarchy and Dictatorship. According to one report, 71% of the world's 2024 population lives in an autocracy.

Once in power, they eliminate all other kinds of authority in the country, like Judge, the legislature, and Political party. All Totalitarianism regimes are autocracies. Having an autocratic government does not mean the country is governed well or governed poorly. It is just a description on how it is set up. == History == File:Aztec Human Sacrifice.jpg human sacrifice.
