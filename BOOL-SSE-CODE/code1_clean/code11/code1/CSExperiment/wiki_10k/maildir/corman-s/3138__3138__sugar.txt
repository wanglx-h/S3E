File:Sugar 2xmacro.jpg, the most common sugar]] '''Sugar'''IPA: , is the common name for several chemical substances, some of which taste Sweet (taste). Mostly, it refers to sucrose, lactose, or fructose. Sugar is in certain kinds of food, or it is added to make it sweeter. Regular or pure sugar, or ''sucrose, is'' extracted from sugarcane or sugar beet. Brazil produces the most sugar per person and India's total consumption of sugar is the highest for a country.International sugar statistics http://www.illovosugar.com/World_of_sugar/Sugar_Statistics/International.aspx Fructose is the sugar that is in fruits. Sucrose and fructose are both made by two smaller sugars. Glucose is the more common of these smaller sugars. The human body changes regular sugar into the smaller sugars. File:Saccharose2.svg – made of two smaller sugars]] File:Cuba - Sugar Cane Field (1909).jpg Sugars are a kind of carbohydrate since it made from carbon, hydrogen and oxygen.You can think of this as "carbon + water". Sugar can be ''simple carbohydrates'' or ''complex carbohydrates''. Simple carbohydrates are made of only one or a few of the smallest sugars. Complex carbohydrates are made of ''many'' of the smallest sugars. Sugar can be different colors. For example, brown sugar has molasses in it, and is often used in baking. There are 387 calories in 100 g of sugar. == Production == === Sugarcane === {| class="wikitable" style="float:right; clear:left; width:15em; text-align:center;" ! colspan="2" |Sugarcane production – 2020 |- ! style="background:#ddf; width:75%;" |Country ! style="background:#ddf; width:25%;" |Millions of tonnes |- | |757.1 |- | |370.5 |- | |108.1 |- | |75.0 |- |'''World''' |'''1,870''' |- | colspan="2" |Source: FAOSTAT, United Nations |} Global production of sugarcane in 2020 was 1.9billion tonnes, with Brazil producing 40% of the world total and India 20% (table). Sugar cane can be any of many species, or their hybrids, of giant grasses in the genus, or group ''Saccharum'' in the family Poaceae. They are grown in tropical climates in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia over centuries for the sucrose found in their stems. File:World_production_of_raw_sugar,_main_producers.svg Sugar cane needs a climate with no frost and enough rain in the Season to Growth. It is harvested by a machine or by hand, and cut into pieces and moved to the Sugar mill where it is Sugar mill. The juice is extracted with water or it is extracted by diffusion. The juice is clarified with Calcium hydroxide and heated to destroy enzymes. The thin syrup result is concentrated in Evaporation, after then water is removed. The Supersaturation Solution (chemistry) is added with sugar crystals, making crystals and drying easier. Molasses, Fibre from the stems, is burned to give energy for the sugar extraction process. The Raw food sugar crystals have a sticky brown coating and may be bleached by sulfur dioxide, or may be treated in a carbonation process to make it whiter. About of water is needed for every of sugar to be produced. === Sugar beet === {| class="wikitable" style="float:right; clear:left; width:15em; text-align:center;" ! colspan="2" |Sugar beet production – 2020 |- ! style="background:#ddf; width:75%;" |Country ! style="background:#ddf; width:25%;" |Millions of tonnes |- | |33.9 |- | |30.5 |- | |28.6 |- | |26.2 |- |'''World''' |'''253''' |- | colspan="2" |Source: FAOSTAT, United Nations |} In 2020, global production of sugar beets was 253 million tonnes, led by Russia with 13% of the world total (table). Sugar beet is harvested during cool seasons,It is fall and winter as harvesting seasons. and then a rotor beater cuts off the head of the beet, which then is then left in the field. A beet loader pulls the beets out of the earth and into a truck, where the beet is driven to a processing plant. Czarnikow|url=https://www.czarnikow.com/blog/how-is-beet-sugar-produced|access-date=2022-11-26|language=en}} The processor slices the beets into thin chips called cossettes. The extraction takes place in a diffuser where the beet is kept in contact with hot water for about an hour.Diffusion is the process by which the color and flavor of tea comes out of the tea leaves in a teapot but most diffusers weighs several hundred tons when full of beet and extraction water. The diffuser is a large agitated tank in which the cossettes slowly move from one end to the other as the water is moved in the opposite direction. This is called counter-current flow and as the water goes it becomes a stronger and stronger sugar juice. == History == In around 8,000 BC, people in New Guinea and Polynesia had Sugarcane where it had then came to Asia. With interest of the people who had discovered it, sugar cane and it's practices of planting sugar cane had gone to Southwest Asia, including China and India. alimentarium|url=https://www.alimentarium.org/en/fact-sheet/history-sugar|access-date=2022-11-26|website=www.alimentarium.org|language=en}} In 510 BC the Persian Empire (Iran), Darius the Great invaded India where he found cane sugar which was named "''the reed which gives honey without bees''". The growing was kept unknown and showing the sugar for a rich profit. The Arab people invasion of Persia in 642 BC, sugar cane refining techniques had been added by Eastern Mediterranean people. Records from the Ancient Greece and Roma people would suggest that sugar cane was used in medicine. In around 350 CE, Indian people discovered how to Crystallization sugar.This is turning the sugar into a crystal-like atomic form. Around 650 CE, crystallized sugar became a Cuisine Staple food across India, China, and the Middle East.
