In 2014, 759,800 people lived in Kraków. It is on the Vistula river. Krakow is the capital of Lesser Poland Voivodeship (''województwo małopolskie''); before that it was the capital of Kraków Voivodship (since 14th century). During the mid-early 19th century, Krakow became an Free City Krakow, under the name of "The Free, Independent and Strictly Neutral City of Krakow". However, it was annexed by Austria-Hungary in 1846. Pope John Paul II was raised in Krakow and was its archbishop from 1964 until he was elected as Pope in 1978. When it was later announced that the city will host World Youth Day in 2016, it will be a tribute to the late Pope who became a saint in 2014. From 2002 to 2014, the mayor of the city was Jacek Majchrowski. His successor was Aleksander Miszalski. During World War II, there was once a Kraków Ghetto in the city which held mostly the Jews of Kraków. The ghetto was liquidated for the final time in March 1943, with most of its inhabitants sent to the Treblinka extermination camp. ==Sister cities== Kraków is twinned, or maintains close relations with: {| class="wikitable" |- valign="top" | * Bordeaux, France * Bratislava, Slovakia * Budapest, Hungary * Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA * Curitiba, Brazil * Cusco, Peru * Edinburgh, Scotland, UK * Fes, Morocco * Florence, Italy * Frankfurt am Main, Germany * Gothenburg, Sweden || * Grozny, Russia * Innsbruck, Austria * Kyiv, Ukraine * Lahore, Pakistan * La Serena, Chile, Chile * Leipzig, Germany * Leuven, Belgium * Lviv, Ukraine * Milan, Italy * Nuremberg, Germany * Orléans, France || * Pécs, Hungary * Rochester, New York, USA * Quito, Ecuador * Saint Petersburg, Russia * San Francisco, California, USA * Seville, Spain * Solothurn, Switzerland * Tbilisi, Georgia * Veliko Turnovo, Bulgaria * Vilnius, Lithuania * Zagreb, Croatia |} == Related pages == *Trams in Kraków == Other websites == * [https://www.krakow.pl/ Official website of the city] Category:Kraków
