These changes are meant to make the races more interesting, so more people watch F1 on television.

The helmets are very strong as well, even being able to withstand a truck driving over it. == Cars == Carbon fiber is the ideal material for the body of Formula One cars, because it is light and strong. Because of this, the cars are very expensive to build and repair. The design of cars differs from team to team. Each team has two entries into the championship.
