Subject: Midway Atoll
'''Midway Atoll''' is an island in the Pacific Ocean and was the site of a famous battle in World War II, the Battle of Midway. The United States took control of the atoll in 1867 when nobody lived there. In the 21st century about 40 people live there, mostly working for the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. == Wildlife == File:US Navy 100602-N-7498L-021 More than a million Laysan Albatrosses occupy the entire Midway atoll.jpges at Midway Atoll.]] Midway Atoll is now home to 67-70% of the world's Laysan Albatross population, and 34-39% of the global Black-footed Albatross. While Midway supports nearly three million birds, each seabird species has carved out a specific site on the atoll in which to nest. Seventeen different species of seabird can be found, the rarest of which is the Short-tailed Albatross, otherwise known as the “Golden Gooney.” Fewer than 2,200 are believed to exist due to excessive feather hunting in the late nineteenth century. Over 250 different species of looli marine life are found in the of lagoon and surrounding waters. The critically endangered Hawaiian monk seals raise their pups on the beaches. Monk seals are Benthos foragers and rely on the Midway Atoll’s reef fish, squid, octopus and crustaceans. Green turtle, another threatened species, occasionally nest on the island. The first was found in 2006 on Spitsy Rinaia Island and another in 2007 on Sand Island. A resident pod of 300 spinner dolphins live in the lagoons and nearshore waters. == Other websites == * [http://www.bloosee.com/explore/#lt=28.219256&ln=-177.360535&z=13&m=2&c=111111111111&o=0 Satellite Map and NOAA Chart of Midway] on Bloosee * [http://www.airnav.com/airport/PMDY AirNav - Henderson Field Airport] : Airport facilities and navigational aids. * [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7312777.stm Diary from the middle of nowhere] BBC's environment correspondent David Shukman reports on the threat of plastic rubbish drifting in the North Pacific Gyre to Midway.
