File:Programming code.jpg A '''skill''' is something you learn to do well, usually through practice and experience. It means you can perform a task or action correctly, quickly, and sometimes even in new situations. Skills can be mental, like solving a math problem; physical, like playing soccer or the piano; or social, like working well in a team or handling a disagreement calmly. Some skills, called hard skills, are very specific and easy to measure, like knowing how to fix a car engine or speak another language. Others are called soft skills, such as being organized or a good communicator. These are important too, especially when working with other people, but they are harder to test or grade. When people learn new skills, they usually go through stages. At first, they think a lot about what they are doing and may make mistakes. This is called the cognitive stage. Then, with practice, they get smoother and more confident. Finally, they can do the skill automatically without thinking about every step, this is the autonomous stage. Another model of skill development describes five stages, from Novice to expert, where experts understand patterns and use their intuition to make smart choices. To learn a skill well, it helps to know both what to do (declarative knowledge) and how to do it (procedural knowledge). Scientists have found that different parts of the brain help with different parts of learning. For example, the motor cortex and cerebellum help with body movement, while the prefrontal cortex helps plan and correct mistakes in the early stages of learning. People who become really good at something, like top athletes, musicians, or chess players, do not just practice randomly. They use Practice (learning method), which means working on specific areas that need improvement and getting feedback to keep getting better. Some skills are easy to apply in different situations, but others are harder to transfer. For example, if you learn how to write a science report in school, it might not be easy to apply that skill when writing a real report at work unless you get help connecting the two. That is why teachers and trainers try to help students bridge the gap between practice and real life. In schools and jobs, skills are often organized into charts or levels to help track what someone knows. Employers now focus more on what people can actually do instead of just what Academic degrees they have. In fast-changing fields like technology or medicine, people need to keep learning new skills. That is why many workers take short courses called Microdegree or join upskilling programs to stay up to date. Even robots and AI are being taught “skills” by training them with lots of data or using rewards to guide their actions. But unlike humans, machines do not yet have the ability to reflect, change their approach on their own, or use a skill in a totally different situation without new training. Some people wonder whether skills come more from talent or from practice. Talent is a natural ability, like being born with quick reflexes or a great memory. But most experts agree that practice and learning play a bigger role in becoming truly skilled at something. Also, different cultures value different skills. For example, a community might respect traditional farming methods or craftsmanship, but those skills might not get recognized or paid well in the formal job market. == Relating page == *Education *Human capital ==References== Category:Skills
