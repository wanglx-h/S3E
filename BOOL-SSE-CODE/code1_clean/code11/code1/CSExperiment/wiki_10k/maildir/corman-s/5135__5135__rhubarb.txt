'''Rhubarb''' is one of about 60 plants in the genus '''''Rheum''''', family Polygonaceae. The vegetable rhubarb is ''Rheum rhabarbarum'' (or ''Rheum x hybridum''). The leaves are somewhat toxic because they have oxalic acid, but the red stalks are baking in pies, with sugar to soften their tart flavor. There are many varieties grown for eating. The drug ''rheum'' is prepared from the rhizomes and roots of another species, ''R. officinale'' or medicinal rhubarb. Category:Polygonaceae
