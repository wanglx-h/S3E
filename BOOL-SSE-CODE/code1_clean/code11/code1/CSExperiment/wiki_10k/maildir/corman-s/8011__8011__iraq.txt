Iraq borders with Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to the south, Turkey to the north, Syria to the north-west, Jordan to the west, and Iran to the east. The capital of Iraq is Baghdad. Iraq has been known by the Greek language name Mesopotamia which means ''(Land between the rivers)'' and has been home to continuous wikt:successive civilizations since the 6th millennium BC. The region between the Euphrates and Tigris rivers is often referred to as the cradle of civilization and the birthplace of writing. Iraq was part of several empires, some were Safavid dynasty, and Afsharid dynasty. During World War I's Mesopotamian Campaign, British Empire troops conquered the Ottoman Empire provinces of Basra and Baghdad and later added the province of Mosul to make Iraq. Most Iraqis are Shia Islam with a significant Sunni Muslim minority. == Politics == From 1968 to 2003, Iraq was run by the Ba'ath Party. Saddam Hussein was the President from 1979 until the disbandment of the Ba'ath Party. After the 1990 invasion of Kuwait many countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, France, Italy, Pakistan, and others fought to free Kuwait from Iraqi occupation. Later, some agents believed to be sent by Saddam Hussein tried to kill former President George H. W. Bush with a truck bomb in Kuwait. The Kurdistan Region gained autonomy in the 1990s. Kurdistan Region has its own parliament and army known as the Peshmerga. The March 2003 invasion of Iraq was led by United States, United Kingdom, Australian, France, Denmark and Poland forces. They captured Baghdad and forced the ruling Ba'ath Party of Iraq to surrender. The publicly stated reason for the invasion was that Saddam Hussein refused to let United Nations inspectors look for suspected nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. In the past, Saddam Hussein used chemical weapons to kill the Kurds while trying to suppress a Kurdish rebellion in the northern part of the country. Iraq had done research in making biological and nuclear weapons. This began the Iraq War. The country was initially split into 3 zones, the American occupation zone, the British occupation zone, and the Polish occupation zone similar to the way Germany was divided after the Second World War in 1945. Forces from Denmark controlled areas in the British occupation zone. A new temporary government was formed on June 28, 2004. The coalition forces remained in the country to conduct operations against insurgents. There were many United States, United Kingdom and multi-national troops in the country until December 15, 2011 when the Iraq War had ended and the coalition forces withdrew from Iraq. Tensions between religious groups (Shia and Sunni Muslims, as well as Christians) lead to a great deal of instability in the country. == Geography == File:Iraq provinces Numbered (2024).png]] The country area lies between two rivers; for this reason the area was called Mesopotamia in ancient ages. The rivers Euphrates and Tigris bound what is called the Fertile Crescent. Iraq also has a small coastline along the Persian Gulf, and this coastline was considered the heart of the petroleum trade in Iraq before the First Gulf War. The weather is extremely hot and dry because Iraq is far from seas and oceans and even the close ones are blocked by mountains so that the rainy wind can not reach the inlands. This region has fertile land because of the two rivers. Iraq is divided into 18(discluding partially recognized halabja)Governorates (''muhafazah''). also the Iraqi Constitution has recognized only one autonomous federal region inside Iraq, the name of the region is Kurdistan Region, this region consists of the three Governorates(and one partially recognized one)of Duhok ( دهوك ), Erbil ( اربيل ), As-Sulaymaniyah (السليمانية ) and Halabja (حلبجة) Kurdistan Region Governorates are marked in '''bold.''' Partially recognized Governorate are marked in ''Italic''. {| align="center" |----- | #Al Anbar Governorate (الانبار) #Erbil Governorate ('''اربيل''') #Babil Governorate (بابل) #Baghdad Governorate (بغداد) #Basra Governorate (بصرة) #Dhi Qar Governorate (ذي قار) #Duhok Governorate ('''دهوك''') #Diyala Governorate (ديالى) #'''''Halabja''''' ('''''حلبجة''''') | Karbala Governorate (كربلاء) Kirkuk Governorate (کركوك) Muthanna Governorate (المثنى) Maysan Governorate (ميسان) Nineveh Governorate (نينوى) Najaf Governorate (نجف) Al-Qādisiyyah Governorate (قادسية) Saladin Governorate (صلاح الدين) Sulaymaniyah Governorate ('''السليمانية''') Wasit Governorate (واسط) |} == Economy == Iraq has a large amount of petroleum. Iraq is the world's number four in petroleum production and the world's number two in petroleum reserves. In the past, Iraq sold much of this oil to other countries. After Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, the United Nations stopped Iraq from selling the oil. The United Nations later allowed Iraq to sell some oil to buy food, clothes, and medicine so the people would not suffer as much. This was called the "Oil-for-Food" program. ==Related pages== * Iraq at the Olympics * Iraq national football team * List of rivers of Iraq ==References== ==Other websites== Category:Mesopotamia Category:Members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation Category:Iraq
