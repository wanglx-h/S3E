File:Stomach diagram.gif The '''oesophagus''' (or '''esophagus''') is also called the '''gullet'''. It is the part of the gastrointestinal system between the mouth and the stomach. It connects the pharynx and the stomach. It is about long. The oesophagus is lined with muscle, and is lubrication. Its muscle pushes food down into the stomach. The oesophagus can contract or expand to allow for the passage of food. The muscular movement that pushes the food down the oesophagus is called peristalsis. At the entrance to the stomach there is a ring of muscle called a sphincter. This is usually closed, but relaxes as food approaches, allowing it to enter the stomach. In the stomach, the food is churned until it turns into a soupy mixture called chyme. == Fetal development == The airways and intestines form as the same tube in Embryo development. It starts forming at the belly button (foregut). == Related pages == * Respiratory system * Histamine == References == Category:Anatomy of the digestive system
