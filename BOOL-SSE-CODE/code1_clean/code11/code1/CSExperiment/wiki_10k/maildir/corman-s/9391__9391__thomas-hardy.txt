In the United Kingdom Hardy is generally thought to be one of the greatest figures in English language literature. He lived in the Victorian era. == Early life == Thomas Hardy was born in Upper Bockhampton near Dorchester, Dorset. His father was a stonemason. His mother had read a lot. She added to his formal education. Hardy trained as an architect in Dorchester before moving to London to get a job.

These include ''Tess of the d'Urbervilles'', ''The Mayor of Casterbridge'' and ''Far from the Madding Crowd''. After the publication of ''Jude the Obscure'' in 1895 Hardy gave up novel writing but continued to write poetry including an epic poem called ''The Dynasts''.
