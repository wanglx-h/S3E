Subject: Hart Memorial Trophy
The '''Hart Trophy''' is given to the most valuable player of the National Hockey League every year. It was given to the NHL by Dr. David Hart, father of NHL Coach (sport) and manager Cecil Hart. It was first awarded in 1924. Wayne Gretzky has won the most Hart Trophies with nine, followed by Gordie Howe with six and Eddie Shore with four. Howie Morenz, Bobby Orr, Bobby Clarke, Alex Ovechkin, and Mario Lemieux have won the award three times each. The closest vote for the trophy was in 2002, when Jose Theodore and Jarome Iginla tied; Theodore won because he had more first-place votes. In 1999, Chris Pronger won by one point over Jaromir Jagr; and in 1990, Mark Messier won by two points over Ray Bourque. ==Winners== File:Nels Stewart.jpg, two-time winner]] File:Bobby Clarke 1983.jpg, three-time winner]] File:Wgretz edit2.jpg, nine-time winner]] File:Mario Lemieux 2001.jpg, three-time winner]] File:Sergei Fedorov (2894208988).jpg, first European trained player to win it, one-time winner]] File:Blues vs. Oilers-9046 (6645432023).jpg, one-time winner]] File:Ovechkin reupload.jpg, three-time winner]] File:SidneyCrosby.jpg, two-time winner]] File:Joe Thornton 2016.jpg, only player to switch clubs during his winning season, one-time winner]] {| class="wikitable" |+Positions key !
