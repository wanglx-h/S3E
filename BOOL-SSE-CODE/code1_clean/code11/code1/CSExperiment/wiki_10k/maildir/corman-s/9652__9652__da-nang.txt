'''Da Nang''' is the biggest city in Central Vietnam and the fourth largest city in Vietnam. It has about 870,000 people (2010). The city is built by the Han River (Vietnam) and Vietnam's central coast. Nearby is Hoi An, a popular tourist town, and Huế, Vietnam's former Capital city. It is connected to Hue by the Hai Van Pass, a well-known national highway and popular tourist spot. It is a popular city for tourism, both in-country and international, because of its beaches. Its airport, Da Nang International Airport, used to also be used as airbase to fight against North Vietnam and the Viet Cong during the Vietnam War. The city was a part of Quang Nam province until 1997, when the Vietnamese government decided to make the city its own municipality, or an area directly ruled by the central government. Today, it is one of Vietnam's five municipalities. The other municipalities are Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Haiphong, and Cần Thơ. Da Nang Port is Vietnam's third largest port and the largest port in Central Vietnam. Since it is close to the ocean and since there is little farmland, the city's economy makes much more money from fishing than from farming. Popular tourist attractions include the Ba Na Hills, the Golden Bridge, the Da Nang Sun Wheel, the Marble Mountains, and the Dragon Bridge. Special food and drinks include mì Quảng noodles, bánh xèo, bún chả cá, snails, avocado ice cream, and coconut coffee. Food from Hue and Hoi An are also popular in Danang. Other Chamic sources, with similar definitions, have been proposed. Inrasara (aka Phú Trạm), a researcher specializing in Champa, suggests ''Da Nang'' is a variation of the Cham word ''daknan'' (lit. "the large water"); Sakaya (aka Văn Món), another Champa researcher, claims a connection with the Raglai word ''danang'', meaning "river source". File:LocationVietnamDaNang.png Category:Da Nang
