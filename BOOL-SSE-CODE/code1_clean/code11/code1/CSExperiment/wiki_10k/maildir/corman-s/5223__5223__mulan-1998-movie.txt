The Chinese army recruits each man from every family for them to start a war. Mulan's father suffers an injury and he cannot fight. Mulan disguises herself as a boy and enters the army. A dragon named Mushu accompanies her. At first, Mulan is not taken seriously by the other soldiers but during training, eventually proves that she is better than what they thought. Mulan secretly falls in love with the commander, Li Shang. The army is attacked by the Huns in the snowy mountains. Mulan uses a cannon to start an avalanche which buries and kills the Huns. Mulan is hurt by a sword, and the Medical doctor who examines her finds that she is not a boy but a girl. Li Shang and the Chinese army leave Mulan alone in the mountains. The Chinese Army arrives at the Emperor's palace in the Imperial City for victory celebrations. Mulan sees that several Huns, including Shan Yu, have survived the avalanche. She goes to Imperial City to tell Li Shang but nobody believes her because they are celebrating the end of the war. Shan Yu and the Huns attack the palace and capture the Emperor. Mulan and her soldier friends dress up as palace women so that they can get inside and rescue the Emperor. Shan Yu is left trapped on the palace roof and dies in a Fireworks display. The Emperor thanks Mulan and she returns home. The Emperor tells Li Shang to follow her if he loves her.
