The biggest towns in it are Bournemouth and Poole. There are other smaller towns, some by the sea, like Weymouth, Swanage, West Bay, the Isle of Portland, Dorchester, Wareham, Lyme Regis, Blandford and Wool. ==Location== Dorset is next to Devon, Somerset, Wiltshire and Hampshire. There is a lot of countryside in Dorset, so there are quite a few farmers. Other people work in offices, shops or the holiday business. There are not many factories or industry in Dorset. People come on holiday to Dorset because the countryside and sea is peaceful and pretty, and there are not many big towns and no cities at all. Bournemouth, Poole, Weymouth, Swanage and Lyme Regis are quite famous seaside towns, where most holidaymakers go when they come to Dorset. ==Dorset coast== The Dorset coast is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Jurassic Coast. This includes famous fossil sites where Mary Anning collected, and famous landforms such as Chesil Beach. ==Gallery== Dorset-12-Rinder-2004-gje.jpg|Dorset Sherborne Abbey-12-2004-gje.jpg|Sherborne Abbey Wimbourne Minster-04-2004-gje.jpg|Wimbourne Minster Wimbourne Minster-08-innen-2004-gje.jpg|Wimbourne Minster Kingston Lacey-10-Haus-2004-gje.jpg|Kingston Lacey Kingston Lacey-18-Waescherei-2004-gje.jpg|Kingston Lacey Bere Regis-06-St Johannes der Taeufer-2004-gje.jpg|Bere Regis Bere Regis-10-St Johannes der Taeufer-Kopf-2004-gje.jpg|Bere Regis Forde Abbey-10-2004-gje.jpg|Forde Abbey Category:Dorset Category:Ceremonial counties of England
