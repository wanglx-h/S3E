The protocol defines the signals that the computers will give each other, and other details such as how communication begins and/or ends. ;Types of Protocol * Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), is used for accessing and receiving Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) files on the internet. * Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS), is a more modern version of HTTP. it is also encrypted so other people can't read the data being sent * Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), is used for transferring e-mail between computers. ** Post Office Protocol version 3 ('''PoP3''') is the most common account type for personal e‑mail. Messages are typically deleted from the server when you check your e‑mail. ** Internet Message Access Protocol ('''IMAP''') is a protocol for e-mail retrieval and storage developed in 1986 at Stanford University as an alternative to POP. * File Transfer Protocol (FTP), is used for showing files to be copied between devices. * Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), ensures the delivery of information packets across networks. * Internet Protocol (IP), is responsible for logical addressing called "IP address" to route information between networks. * In computer networking, Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) is a data link (layer 2) protocol used to establish a direct connection between two nodes. *The packets and device protocol(TPADP) makes sure that the other protocols have a back up route. ==References== == Related pages == *Computer network *Internet protocol suite *OSI model *Application programming interface Category:Computer protocols
