The series originally aired on Nick Jr. (block) on Nickelodeon in the United States and Treehouse TV in Canada. The series was made by children's book author, and illustrator Rosemary Wells. It is based on the fictional universe of her ''Max & Ruby'' books. The episodes show stories about three year old Max, an anthropomorphized toddler rabbit, and his big sister, seven year old Ruby, a patient young lady. The series has a good message for its audience by showing Max & Ruby playing together and using respect and love in solving their problems. == Characters == === Main === * Max Bunny (voiced by Billy Rosemberg in seasons 1–3, Tyler Stevenson in seasons 4–5, and Gavin MacIver-Wright in seasons 6–7) is a four-year-old (starting off at three and a half years old) bunny and Ruby's younger brother.
