Familiar to Broadway theatre, radio and early television audiences, this "Apostle of Pep" was regarded almost as a family member by millions because his top-rated radio shows revealed intimate stories and amusing anecdotes about his wife Ida and five daughters. His eye-rolling song-and-dance routines eventually led to his nickname, '''Banjo Eyes''', and in 1933, the artist Frederick J. Garner caricatured Cantor with large round and white eyes resembling the drum-like pot of a banjo. Cantor's eyes became his trademark, often exaggerated in illustrations, and leading to his appearance on Broadway in the musical ''Banjo Eyes'' (1941). He was the original singer of 1929 hit song "Makin' Whoopie". ==References== Category:Presidents of the Screen Actors Guild Category:American stage actors Category:Comedians from New York City Category:American Jews Category:Actors from New York City Category:Singers from New York City Category:American television actors Category:American radio actors Category:1892 births Category:1964 deaths
