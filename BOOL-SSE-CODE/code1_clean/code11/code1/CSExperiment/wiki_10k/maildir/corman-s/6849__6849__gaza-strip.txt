It is one of two territories that make up the State of Palestine. (The other is the West Bank). Gaza City is its main city. The Palestinian National Authority Government Gaza until 2006, and before 2007, Fatah administered the territory. The Islamic group Hamas won by a big majority in elections held in 2006. From 2006 to present, Hamas governs Gaza. ==Geography== === Size === Gaza is a small area: * It is 41 Kilometre (25 miles) long * It ranges from just 6 to 12 kilometers (3.7 to 7.5mi) wide * Its total area is 365 Square kilometre (141 Square mile) * It has an 11-km (7-mi) border with Egypt, near the city of Rafah. According to one article:''The whole of Gaza (aka the Gaza Strip) is about twice the size of Washington, D.C. and three times the population. [...] The Gaza Strip is geographically about the size of Philadelphia, Detroit or the country of Grenada. The Gaza Strip has the same land area as Las Vegas but more than three times the population. There are approximately 2.23 1,000,000 residents of the small territory.'' === Features === Three mountain ridges Parallel (geometry) Gaza's coastline. These ridges are very important to Gaza's topography. Gaza's major river is Wadi Gaza. The Wadi Gaza Nature reserve was established to protect the country's only coastal wetland. Gaza's major cities include: * Khan Yunis is located northeast of Rafah * Several towns around Deir el-Balah are located along the coast between Rafah and Gaza City * Beit Lahia north of Gaza City * Beit Hanoun northeast of Gaza City Al Deira beach is popular for surfers. === Climate === Gaza has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen ''BSh''). Summers are hot and dry. Winters are warm, and the country gets almost all of its rain during this season. Despite the dryness, humidity is high throughout the year. Annual rainfall is higher than in any part of Egypt: between 225mm (9in) in the south and 400mm (16in) in the north. However, almost all of this rain falls between November and February. The country has various Environmentalism problems, including soil degradation and salination of fresh water. ==History== The costal enclave of Gaza has been inhabited for thousands of years. Throughout history, it was fought over by many peoples, including Egyptian Pharaohs, Babylonians, Philistines, and Alexander the Great. However, the Ottoman Empire controlled the area from the 16th century through the end of World War I. At that point, the Ottoman Empire was broken up. After this, the British took control of the area known as Palestine, including the Gaza Strip. At that time, a number of ethnic groups lived there, including Arabs, Jews, and others. The British had offered to let Egypt govern Gaza, but Egypt refused, so Britain itself Occupied territory from 1917–1918. (Previously, in 1906, the Ottomans and the British Empire had set Gaza's international border with Egypt.) The British also occupied Gaza from 1920 until 1948. During this time, tensions deepened between Arab and Jewish communities in Palestine. Jewish leaders who lived in Rafah in the Gaza Strip were forced into detention camps. JPost.com|language=en}} Then, in 1948, the League of Nations ordered a "British Mandate of Palestine". '''1948–1959''' During the 1948 conflict (particularly the 1947–1949 Palestine war), many Arabs and Jews fled their homes throughout the region. The greatest concentration of Palestinians ended up in Gaza. Tens of thousands of Palestinians settled in Gaza after fleeing their homes or being forced to leave. By the end of the war, 25% of Mandatory Palestine's Arab population was in Gaza, though the area constituted only 1% of the land. The same year, the UNRWA (UNRWA) was established to administer various refugee programmes. After 1948, Egypt ruled the Gaza strip under military rule. === 1967 === Israel captured Gaza during the Six Day War.File:Gaza Strip (997008872766305171.jpg == Demographics == File:Girls lining up for class - Flickr - Al Jazeera English.jpg In 2010, approximately 1.6 million people lived in Gaza. Almost a million of them were United Nations-registered refugees. The majority have parents who were refugees following the first major war between Israel and the Arab nations around it, in 1948. Gaza's population has increased since then. Many people living in Gaza are children. Almost half (43.5Percentage) of the population is 14 or younger. In 2014, the median age was 18. Sunni Muslims make up 99.8% of Gaza's population. Christians make up the other 0.2%; there are between 2,000 and 3,000 of them in Gaza.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4514822.stm Middle East Christians: Gaza pastor] BBC News, 21 December 2005 For many centuries, Jews also lived in Gaza, including during the Hasmonean Era (167-63 BCE) and the Geonic Period (600-1050 CE), and also during Ottoman rule and the 20th century. == Blockade of the Gaza Strip == === History of the Blockade === ==== 1967-1996 ==== In June 1967, during the six day war, Israeli forces took control over Gaza strip. Since then, Gaza has been under military rule. Israeli settlers in Gaza were protected by Israeli civilian law. In 1987, after the first First Intifada, Israel made its control over Gaza stricter. By 1994, Israel had built fences, walls and military zones around Gaza. Strict rules who could enter and leave were enforced In 1993, the first agreement of the Oslo Accords were signed between Palestine Liberation Organization(PLO). In the agreement, the PLO and Israel would recognize each other. According to the agreement, Palestinians would have the right to make their own decisions. However, most Palestinians wanted to end the occupation and create an independent state. Disagreements grew. Hamas and Islamic Jihad wanted to cancel the Oslo accord. The Palestinian Authority(PA) had a confrontation with Hamas in 1994, causing more of a divide between the Palestinians. Even fearing a civil war between Fatah and Islamic groups. In 1994, as part of the Oslo Accords, Israel gave the Palestinian Authority some control over parts of the Gaza strip. However Israel still controlled other areas. In January 1996, Hamas and Islamic Jihad called on their supporters not to vote in the 1996 Palestinian elections, because taking part would seem like they accepted the Oslo Accords and that Israel had the right to the existence to exist. '''2000-2008''' During the Second Intifada in 2000, Israel began to place more restrictions on the Gaza strip, limiting the movement of people and goods in and out Gaza. In October 2000, Israel began to frequently bomb Gaza. In 2005, Israel said it was "disengaging" from Gaza by removing its soldiers and settlers. It was thought, it would mean Gaza was free. However, Israel still controlled Gaza's border, sea, and air. As well as the right to defend itself. In 2006, Hamas won the election of the Palestinian Legislative Council election, resulting in taking more control over Gaza by creating its own security force. This led to clashing with Fatah supporters in the Gaza strip. In June 2007, after clashing with Fatah, Hamas took full control over Gaza by force. After that, Israel and Egypt began a full blockade of Gaza. The full blockade resulted in closed borders, limited what goods could go in and out, and restriction of the movement of people. In 2008, Operation Cast Lead resulted in a lot of damage to Gaza's infrastructure, it was hard to rebuild because of the limitations of the blockade. '''2009-2014''' In January 2009, Israel began a naval blockade of Gaza. The goal was to stop weapons and materials from reaching Hamas. However, it further limited what could enter or leave Gaza. It was seen as causing too much harm to civilians, by making it harder to bring humanitarian aid. In 2010, Israel slightly eased the blockade after international protests which were caused by the Gaza flotilla raid. This allowed more goods to enter however it kept the naval blockade. In 2014, during 2014 Gaza War, the Gaza blockade caused serious problems. There was almost no clean water and thousands of homes were destroyed. Even though Israel would ease the blockade after international pressure by allowing more goods into Gaza, most restrictions stayed in place. Israel controlled the food that could enter. Even after the war the blockade stayed in place. === 2023 - present === After the 7 October 2023 attack on Israel on Israel by Hamas, Israel declared a state of war. Because of that, it increased its blockade of the Gaza strip on 9 October 2023. This included restrictions on the entry of goods, food, water, fuel, electricity, and medicine into Gaza. Israel said it would not stop the blockade until all the Israeli hostages taken by Hamas were returned. The UNRWA and others say the situation led to a serious humanitarian crisis. Many accuse Israel of war crimes by using Famine as a weapon of war. ==== Timeline ==== {| class="wikitable" |+Key events of the Israeli Blockade October 2023 - 2025 !Date !Event !References |- |9 October 2023 |Israel intensifies the blockade of the Gaza Strip as a reaction to the 7 October 2023 attack on Israel by Hamas. | |- |21 October 2023 |After negotiations, first supplies enter Gaza through the Rafah Border Crossing again. | |- |January 2024 |56% of planned aid deliveries into Northern Gaza and 25% into Middle Gaza are not allowed by Israel. | Flash Update #111|url=https://www.ochaopt.org/content/hostilities-gaza-strip-and-israel-flash-update-111|access-date=2025-05-22|website=United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs - Occupied Palestinian Territory|language=en}} |- |February 2024 |Israeli protestors block aid trucks from entering Gaza. | |- |January 2025 |Following deals resulting in a :en:2025_Gaza_war_ceasefire, trucks can enter Gaza again. | World Food Programme|url=https://www.wfp.org/stories/hunger-gaza-first-aid-trucks-roll-ceasefire-takes-effect|access-date=2025-05-22|website=www.wfp.org|language=en}} |- |2 March 2025 |Israel completely blocks aid delivery into Gaza, de facto ending the ceasefire which started in January 2025. | |- |30 April 2025 |The Israeli blockade reaches a time span of 60 days, making it the longest complete blockade of Gaza since October 2023. | UN News|url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/04/1162666|access-date=2025-05-22|website=news.un.org|language=en}} |- |20 May 2025 |After international pressure, Israel relieves a part of the complete blockade of Gaza.
