File:Junghans Additionsstoppuhr, 1960er-Jahre (2 qu).JPG A '''stopwatch''' is a tool used to measurement the amount of time something takes. For example, to learn how soon a car can reach 60 miles per hour, or how much time it takes a running to run 40 US yard. These days, stopwatches are even installed in digital watches. You press a button to start the time and press it again to stop the time. A stopwatch can tell you the time in seconds, hundredths of a second, or thousandths of a second.
