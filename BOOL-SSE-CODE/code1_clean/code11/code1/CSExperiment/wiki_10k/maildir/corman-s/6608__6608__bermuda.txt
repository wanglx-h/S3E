The land has one main island and 180 smaller islands. Bermuda is a popular Tourism place, with mild weather during the winter months. Off the east coast of the United States, Bermuda's nearest landmass is Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, about 1,030 kilometres (640mi) to the west-northwest. It is about 1,373 kilometres (853mi) south of Halifax Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia, Canada, and 1,770 kilometres (1,100mi) northeast of Miami, Florida. Its capital (city) city is Hamilton, Bermuda. ==History== File:HamiltonStreet.jpg city).]] in 1505 by Spanish navigator Juan de Bermúdez (who said it to be inhabited only with pigs), after whom the islands are named. Bermúdez claimed it for the Spanish Empire. Unoccupied, the island was settled by England in 1609, making it the oldest and most population remaining British overseas territory. Its first capital, St George's, was founded in 1612 and is the oldest continuously inhabited English town in the Americas."Bermuda – History and Heritage". Smithsonian.com. 6 November 2007, webpage:[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/destination-hunter/bermuda-history-heritage.html SM-Bermuda]. == Geography == The country is in the Atlantic Ocean, near the western edge of the Sargasso Sea. It is about 580 nautical miles (1070km, 670mi) east-southeast of Cape Hatteras on the Outer Banks of North Carolina and about 590 nautical miles (1100km, 690mi) southeast of Martha's Vineyard. The island is due east of Fripp Island, South Carolina. It has 103km (64mi) of coastline. The territory has 181 islands. The total area is 53.3 square kilometres (20.6sqmi). The largest island is ''Main Island'', sometimes itself called ''Bermuda''. ==Climate== Bermuda has a subtropical climate.Forbes, Keith. "Bermuda Climate and Weather". The Royal Gazette, 2008, webpage: [http://www.bermuda-online.org/climateweather.htm B-clim]. The weather is humid and, as a result, the summertime heat index can be high, even though mid-August temperatures rarely exceed Winters are mild, with average daytime temperatures in January and February around The temperature rarely drops below 10°C Bermuda is very likely to be affected by tropical cyclone. The island's small size means that direct landfall (meteorology) are rare. The last hurricane to cause significant damage to Bermuda was Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale Hurricane Fabian on 5 September 2003. The only source of fresh water in Bermuda is rainfall. It is collected on roofs and catchments and stored in tanks. Each home usually has at least one of these tanks forming part of its foundation. == Flora and fauna == When discovered, Bermuda had no people. It was mostly covered by forests of Juniperus bermudiana, with mangrove marshes along its shores. Only 165 of the island's current 1000 vascular plant species are considered indigenous (ecology). Of those 15, including the cedar, are endemism. Many species of palm trees have been introduced to Bermuda. Coconut palms grow there, making it the furthest north place for the natural growth of this species. While coconuts grow on Bermuda, the lack of heat does not usually let them properly set fruit. The only Indigenous (ecology) mammals of Bermuda are five species of bats. All of these bats are also in the eastern United States — ''Lasionycteris noctivagans'', ''Lasiurus borealis'', ''Lasiurus cinereus'', ''Lasiurus seminolus'' and ''Perimyotis subflavus''. Other commonly known fauna of Bermuda includes its national bird, the Bermuda Petrel, and the Bermuda Rock Skink. The skink was long thought to have been the only indigenous land vertebrate of Bermuda. It has recently been discovered, however, that a species of terrapin predated the arrival of humans on the archipelago. == Parishes and municipalities == File:Bermuda-divmap.png Bermuda is divided into nine parishes and two municipality. Bermuda's nine parishes: * Devonshire Parish, Bermuda * Hamilton Parish, Bermuda * Paget Parish, Bermuda * Pembroke Parish, Bermuda * St. George's Parish, Bermuda * Sandys Parish, Bermuda * Smith's Parish, Bermuda * Southampton Parish, Bermuda * Warwick Parish, Bermuda Bermuda's two municipalities: * Hamilton, Bermuda (city) * St. George's, Bermuda (town) Bermuda's two informal villages: * Flatts Village, Bermuda * Somerset, Bermuda Despite their names, Jones Village (in Warwick), Cashew City (St. George's), Claytown (Hamilton), Middle Town (Pembroke) and Tucker's Town (St. George's) are merely neighborhoods. Dandy Town and North Village are sports clubs and Harbour View Village is a small public housing development. ==Economy== Bermuda has a wealthy economy, with finance as its largest sector, followed by tourism."Bermuda's Tourism Industry", Tayfun King, Fast Track, BBC World News (3 Nov. 2009), webpage: [http://news.bbc.co.uk/player/nol/newsid_8330000/newsid_8339800/8339850.stm?bw=bb&;mp=wm&;news=1&;nol_storyid=8339850&;bbcws=1 BBC50]. In 2005, Bermuda was even claimed to have the world's highest GDP person, yet these statistics are hard to verify as Bermuda is not classified as a country but rather as a territory of the U.K. File:Bermuda topographic map-en.png == Main sights == File:BDA Bermuda.jpg Bermuda's pink sand beaches and clear, cerulean blue ocean waters are popular with tourists. Many of Bermuda's hotels are along the south shore of the island. In addition to its beaches, there are a number of sightseeing attractions. Historic St George's is a World Heritage Site.
