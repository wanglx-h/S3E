It should not be confused with Aegukka, which has the same name. The lyrics of the Aegukga sung today were created around 1907, a time when the country was under threat from foreign invasions, to inspire patriotism, loyalty, and a sense of independence. Over time, the lyrics were refined by various pioneers to their current form, and the melody was set to the Scottish folk song "Auld Lang Syne." Ahn Ik-tae (안익태), who was active abroad, felt it was unfortunate that the Aegukga was sung to a foreign melody. In 1935, he composed the melody that we sing today. The Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea adopted this composition as the national anthem, but it was only spread overseas. In Korea, the anthem continued to be sung to the Scottish folk melody until the establishment of the government after liberation. After the establishment of the South Korean government in 1948, Ahn's composition was used at official events and included in school textbooks nationwide, becoming widely sung across the country. Subsequently, this Aegukga was widely spread abroad and became established as the de facto national anthem. ith the formalization of the Aegukga as the national anthem, it was actively promoted in the 1950s through media like the Korean News. Additionally, various guidelines and directives, such as the "Instructions on Etiquette for Flag Hoisting and Aegukga Singing" (1966), gradually incorporated it into national ceremonies. The instructions stated that during the salute to the national flag and the singing of the Aegukga, people should show proper respect by standing still, and all passing individuals and vehicles should stop to show respect. == Lyrics == {| class="wikitable" !Words of the song in Korean language !Words of the song using Revised Romanization of Korean !Pronunciation of these words using the International Phonetic Alphabet !Words of the song in English language |- style="vertical-align:top; text-align:center; white-space:nowrap;" | 동해 물과 백두산이 마르고 닳도록, 하느님이 보우하사 우리나라 만세. 무궁화 삼천리 화려 강산, 대한 사람, 대한으로 길이 보전하세. 남산 위에 저 소나무 철갑을 두른 듯 바람서리 불변함은 우리 기상일세. }} 가을 하늘 공활한데 높고 구름 없이 밝은 달은 우리 가슴 일편단심일세. }} 이 기상과 이 맘으로 충성을 다하여 괴로우나 즐거우나 나라 사랑하세. }}}} | Donghae mulgwa Baekdusani mareugo daltorok Haneunimi bouhasa urinara manse.

In autumn's, arching evening sky, crystal and cloudless blue; be the radiant moon our spirit, steadfast, single and true. With such a will, such a spirit, loyalty, heart and hand, Let us love, come grief, come gladness, this our beloved land. |} ===A more poetic translation=== '''I''' East Sea's waters and Baekdu Mountain stand strong and proud, God bless our nation forever, let our cheers ring loud.
