They formed in Sydney, Australia in November 1973. AC/DC has sold an estimated 200 million albums worldwide, including 68 million in the United States of America. The two primary founders of the band, Malcolm Young and Angus Young, developed the idea for the band's name after their sister Margaret saw the initials "AC/DC" written on a sewing machine. "AC/DC" is an abbreviation for "alternating current/direct current," which refer to the two different types of electric charge. The band chose the name because of their energetic “electrical” style of playing rock and roll. Even though AC/DC considers their music style simply as "rock and roll", AC/DC are often considered pioneers of heavy metal music. == Band members == === Current members === * Brian Johnson - vocals * Stevie Young - guitar * Angus Young - guitar (1973—) * Cliff Williams - bass guitar (1977—) * Phil Rudd - drums and percussion (1975–1983 and 1994—) === Past members === * Malcolm Young - rhythm guitar, backing vocals (1973–2014; died 2017) * Bon Scott - vocals (1974–1980; his death) * Dave Evans - vocals (1973–1974) * Colin Burgess - drums and percussion (1973–1974; substituted 1975; died 2023) * Rob Bailey II - bass (1973–1974) * Noel Taylor - drums and percussion (1974) * Paul Matters - bass (1975; died 2020) * Larry van Kriedt - Bass, saxophone (1973–1975) * Peter Clack - drums and percussion (1974–1975) * Mark Evans II - bass (1974–1975) * Simon Wright - drums and percussion (1984–1989) * Chris Slade - drums and percussion (1989–1994, 2015–2016) ==Discography== ===Albums=== * ''High Voltage'' (Australia only) (1975) * ''T.N.T.
