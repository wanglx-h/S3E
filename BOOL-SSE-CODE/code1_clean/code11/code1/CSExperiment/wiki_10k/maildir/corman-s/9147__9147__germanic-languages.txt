}} The '''Germanic''' languages are a group of Indo-European languages. They came from one language, Proto-Germanic language, which was first spoken in Scandinavia in the Iron Age. Today, the Germanic languages are spoken by around 515 million people as a first language. English language is the most spoken Germanic language, with 360-400 million native speakers. The Germanic languages are the East Germanic languages (all Extinct language), the North Germanic languages, and the West Germanic languages. When Proto-Germanic split from Proto-Indo-European language, one of the main changes to phonology was Grimm's law. ==References== ==Sources== * * == Related pages == *Runes Category:Germanic languages Category:Languages of Europe
