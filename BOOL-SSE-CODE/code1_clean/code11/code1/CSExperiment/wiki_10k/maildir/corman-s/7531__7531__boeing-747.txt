It can carry people, cargo and many other things. Boeing designed the 747's upper deck to be a first class lounge or just extra seats. They also designed the upper deck so that the aircraft could be changed into a cargo plane easily. This was done by removing seats and putting in a cargo door at the front of the plane. Boeing did this because they thought that supersonic airliners would become much more popular than the 747 and other subsonic airliners. However, they thought that subsonic cargo planes would always be popular.Orlebar 2002, p. 50. It was thought that the 747 would become unpopular after 400 were sold.Haenggi 2003, pp. 14–15. However, 1,000 planes had been made by 1993, so it stayed popular.Sutter 2006, p. 259.

At that time, they were using the Lockheed C-141 Starlifter. However, the Air Force thought that a much bigger plane which could carry more cargo was needed. The Air Force called the big plane the CX-Heavy Logistics System (CX-HLS). It needed to be able to carry of cargo and travel at Mach 0.75 (). It also had to be able to fly for while carrying of cargo. The cargo bay had to be wide, high and long. There had to be doors for the bay at the front and the back of the plane.Norton 2003, pp. 5–12. The Air Force also wanted the plane to have only four engines. This meant that new engines had to be made. On May 18, 1964, Boeing, Douglas Aircraft Company, General Dynamics, Lockheed Corporation and Martin Marietta designed a plane. GE Aviation, Curtiss-Wright and Pratt & Whitney designed the engines. The Air Force liked Boeing, Douglas and Lockheed's designs. They also liked General Electric and Pratt & Whitney's engine designs. In 1965, Lockheed's plane and General Electric's engines were used for the C-5 Galaxy. At that time, it was the biggest military cargo plane in the world. ===Airliner=== The idea for the 747 was thought of in the 1960s.Norris and Wagner 1997, p. 13.

The 747 has a lot of Flap (aircraft) on the wing.Guy and Wagner 1997, pp. 25–26. The flaps make the wings bigger by 21 percent. They also make 90 percent more lift when they are used.Jenkins 2000, p. 19. Boeing tried to give the 747 to Pan Am by the end of 1969.

In one important test, 560 volunteers evacuationd a replica of a 747 cabin using the emergency chutes. The first evacuation took two and a half minutes. However, the FAA says that the maximum time for an evacuation is 90seconds. Many of the volunteers were hurt. More evacuations happened, and they eventually reached the 90seconds. However, they also caused a lot of injuries. Evacuating from the top deck of the plane was difficult. Instead of using the usual slides, the volunteers had to leave the plane using a harness.Irving 1994, p. 383. The plane's taxiing also had to be tested. Boeing made "Waddell's Wagon" (named after a 747 test pilot, Jack Waddell) to train the pilots. "Waddell's Wagon" was a replica of a 747 cockpit which was put on the roof of a truck.

The 747-300 was made in 1980 and the 747-400 was made in 1985. The newest version, the 747–8, was announced in 2005. These types also have smaller sub-types. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) names these planes by combining the model number of the plane with its type number. For example, the 747-100 is "B741" and the 747-400 is "B744".[http://www.icao.int/publications/DOC8643/Pages/Search.aspx "ICAO Document 8643."] ''International Civil Aviation Organization.''

Later, airlines began to use the upper deck to hold more people instead of using it as a lounge. Boeing then made an upper deck with ten windows. Some −100s had the new ten-window upper deck installed after the plane was made (retrofitted).[http://www.aircraftspotting.net/aircraft/boeing_747.html "Boeing 747."] ''Aircraft Spotting''.

Boeing did not make a freighter version of the 747–100, but some airlines have turned some 747-100s into freighters.[http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgEX.nsf/0/a590a0405960013a86256d4400727f45/$FILE/1870D.pdf "FAA Regulatory and Guidance Library (PDF)."] ''FAA''. Retrieved: December 12, 2007. See reference to Supplementary Type Certificates for freighter conversion. 167 747-100s were made. ===747-100SR=== After Japanese airlines requested an aircraft to fly routes between major cities in Japan, Boeing produced the -100SR. This model flies shorter distances, but is able to carry more passengers. The first -100SR started flying with Japan Air Lines (JAL) on October 7, 1973. The -100SR had four General Electric CF6-45A2 or Pratt & Whitney JT9D-7A engines. A total of 7 -100SR were produced. Later, Boeing designed a type of -100SR with the ability of taking off with greater weight. This was the -100BSR. It was first delivered to All Nippon Airways (ANA) on December 21, 1978. 20 -100BSR were delivered to JAL and ANA. In 1986, 2 -100BSR with stretched upper deck (SUD) from the -300 series were delivered to JAL. It was the last -100SR/BSR ever built. The last delivery was to JAL, in September 1986. There were a total of 29 -100SR/BSR made.''"[http://www.boeing.com/boeing/commercial/747family/pf/pf_classics.page#200 Boeing: Technical Specificaions -- 747 Classics]."''retrieved November 7, 2013. ===747SP=== File:Syrian.747sp.arp.750pix.jpg The 747SP (SP means special performance) is designed as Pan Am and Iran Air both wanted a wide-body plane that can fly long distances; from New York to the Middle East (for Pan Am) and Tehran to New York (for Iran Air). The first 747SP was produced on May 19, 1975. Its first flight was on July 4. On this flight, it flew at a top speed of Mach 0.92 (). It started flying people on April 25, 1976, after being delivered on March 5. Now, it is not often used. A total of 45 747SP were made and used by airlines like Qantas, China Airlines, Air China, and South African Airways. ===747-200=== After the -100 were made, Boeing started making -200. The -200 has a longer range, but still carries the same number of people. This is because airlines said the -100 could not fly long distances. The -200 is made in passenger type (-200B), freighter type (-200F), Combi type (A plane that carries both cargo and people; -200M) and convertible type (a plane that can be easily changed to carry cargo; -200C). The first -200B was finished on September 10, 1970 before its first flight on October 11 and finally, it started being used by KLM. Boeing then started making the other types of -200. The -200F first flight was on November 30, 1971, 7 days after it was finished. It was then delivered to Lufthansa. The -200C first flew on March 23, 1973 before being delivered to World Airways in May the same year. Finally, the -200M had its first flight on November 11, 1974 before being delivered to Air Canada. There was a total of 393 -200 series ever made, which includes 225 -200B, 78 -200M, 73 -200F, 13 -200C and 4 military. === 747-300 === The 747-300 is a stretched upper deck version of the 747–200. It was designed to fit more passengers on the upper deck. The 747-300 also has updated General Electric CF6-80C2 engines. Otherwise, there are not many differences between the 747-200 and 747–300. The 747-300 has a length of 231feet 10inches and a wingspan of 195feet 8inches. === 747-400 === File:NWA 747-400 at NRT.jpgThe 747-400 was the next-generation Boeing 747 introduced in 1989. It is the best-selling variant of the Boeing 747. It includes improvements over the 747-300 including new engines, and new winglets, which improve fuel efficiency. Its length is the same as the 747-300 but the wingspan has been increased to 211feet 5inches. The 747-400 retains the same longer upper deck as the 747-300 (excluding freighter versions), and came in six variants: the 747–400, 747-400F, 747-400M, 747-400D, 747-400ER, and the 747-400ERF. === 747-8 === File:Lufthansa, Boeing 747-830, D-ABYC (13057740385).jpg The last variant of the Boeing 747 was announced in 2005 and released in 2011. It includes a longer stretched upper deck, a new Boeing Sky Interior, an updated flight deck, new wings based on ones from the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, and new GEnx turbofan engines. It totals 250feet in length, making it the longest commercial passenger jet ever built. The 747-8 comes in two variants: 747-8I and 747-8F (freighter). == Accidents and Problems == * March 27, 1977 - the deadliest aviation accident in history occurred when KLM Flight 4805 Tenerife airport disaster with Pan Am 1736 in heavy fog at Tenerife Airport, resulting in 583 fatalities.
