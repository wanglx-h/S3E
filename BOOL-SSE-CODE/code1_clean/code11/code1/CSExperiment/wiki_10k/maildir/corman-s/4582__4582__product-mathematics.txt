In mathematics, a '''product''' is a number or a quantity obtained by multiplication two or more numbers together. For example: 4 × 7 = 28 Here, the number 28 is called the product of 4 and 7. As another example, the product of 6 and 4 is 24, because 6 times 4 is 24. The product of two Positive number is positive, just as the product of two negative numbers is positive as well (e.g., -6 × -4 = 24). == Pi product notation == A short way to write the product of many numbers is to use the capital Greek letter Pi (letter): \prod. This notation (or way of writing) is in some ways similar to the Sum#Sigma_notation. Informally, given a sequence of numbers (or elements of a multiplicative structure with unit) say a_i we define \prod_{1\leq i\leq n}a_i:=a_1\dotsm a_n. A rigorous definition is usually given recursively as follows : \prod_{1\leq i\leq n}a_i := \begin{cases} 1 & \text{ for } n=0 , \\ \left(\prod_{1\leq i\leq n-1}a_i\right) a_n & \text{ for } n\geq1 . \end{cases} An alternative notation for \prod_{1\leq i\leq n} is \prod_{i=1}^n. === Properties === :\prod_{i=1}^n i = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot ... \cdot n = n! (n! is pronounced "n factorial" or "factorial of n") :\prod_{i=1}^n x = x^n (i.e., the usual nth power operation) :\prod_{i=1}^n n = n^n (i.e., n multiplied by itself n times) :\prod_{i=1}^n c \cdot i = \prod_{i=1}^n c \cdot \prod_{i=1}^n i = c^n \cdot n! (where c is a constant independent of i) From the above equation, we can see that ''any'' number with an exponent can be represented by a product, though it normally is not desirable. Unlike summation, the sums of two terms cannot be separated into different sums. That is, :\prod_{i=1}^4 (3 + 4) \neq \prod_{i=1}^4 3 + \prod_{i=1}^4 4, This can be thought of in terms of polynomials, as one generally cannot separate terms inside them before they are raised to an exponent, but with products, this is possible: :\prod_{i=1}^n a_ib_i=\prod_{i=1}^na_i\prod_{i=1}^nb_i. === Relation to Summation === The product of powers with the same base can be written as an Exponential function of the sum of the powers' exponents: :\prod_{i=1}^n a^{c_i} = a^{c_1} \cdot a^{c_2} \dotsm a^{c_n}= a^{c_1 + c_2 + ... + c_n} = a^{(\sum_{i=1}^n c_i)} == Related pages == * Cartesian product * Cross product * Dot product == References == Category:Arithmetics
