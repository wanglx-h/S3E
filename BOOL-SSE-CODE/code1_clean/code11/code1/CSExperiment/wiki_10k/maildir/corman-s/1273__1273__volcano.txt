VolcanoesThe plural of volcano can be ''either'' volcanos or volcanoes. Both are correct and it is not a matter of British vs US spelling. ''Oxford English Dictionary''. are formed by the movement of tectonic plates. Volcanoes can also form where there is stretching and thinning of the crust's plates, e.g., in the East African Rift. Volcanoes are not typically found where two tectonic plates slide past one another. Volcanism away from plate boundaries is caused by mantle plumes. These so-called "hotspot (geology)", for example Hawaii, are thought to arise from upwelling magma from the structure of the Earth, 3,000km deep in the Earth. Most volcanoes have a volcanic crater at the top. When a volcano is active volcano, materials come out of it. The materials include lava, steam, gaseous sulfur compounds, Volcanic ash and broken Rock (geology) pieces. When there is enough pressure, the volcano erupts. Some volcanic eruptions blow off the top of the volcano. Sometimes, the magma comes out quickly or slowly depending on the eruption. Some eruptions come out at a side instead of the top. Volcanoes are found on planets other than Earth. An example is Olympus Mons on Mars (planet). Volcanologists are scientists who study volcanoes using methods from geology, chemistry, geography, mineralogy, physics and sociology. The world's biggest volcano is named Mauna Loa in Hawaii. Mauna Loa is part of the five volcanoes on Hawaii's 'Big Island'. The most recent time this volcano erupted was in 1984. It erupted 33 times in the last 170 years. Like all the other Hawaiian volcanoes, Mauna Loa was created by the movement of the Pacific tectonic plate which moved over the Hawaii Hotspot (geology) in the Earth's mantle. Mauna Loa is 4,196meters tall. It is a shield volcano. The largest recent eruption from Mauna Loa left a lava trail long. == Types of volcanoes == The lava and pyroclastic material (clouds of ash, lava fragments and vapor) that comes out from volcanoes can make many different kinds of land shapes. There are two basic kinds of volcanoes. === Shield volcanoes === These volcanoes are formed by fluid low-silica mafic lava. Shield volcanoes are built out of layers of lava from continual eruptions (without explosions). Because the lava is so fluid, it spreads out, often over a wide area. Shield volcanoes do not grow to a great height, and the layers of lava spread out to give the volcano gently wikt:slope. Shield volcanoes can produce huge areas of basalt, which is usually what lava is when cooled. The base of the volcano increases in size over successive eruptions where solidified lava spreads out and accumulates. Some of the world's largest volcanoes are shield volcanoes. Even though their sides are not very ''steep'', shield volcanoes can be huge. Mauna Kea in Hawaii is the biggest mountain on Earth if it is measured from its base on the floor of the sea. === Stratovolcanoes === File:Kodaki fuji frm shojinko refurb.jpg, an active stratovolcano in Japan that last erupted in 170708]] File:Tavurvur volcano edit.jpg, an active stratovolcano near Rabaul in Papua New Guinea]] A stratovolcano, also known as a '''composite volcano''', is a tall, cone volcano. It is built up of many layers of hardened lava, tephra, pumice, and volcanic ash. Unlike shield volcanoes, stratovolcanoes have a steep profile and periodic eruptions. The lava that flows from stratovolcanoes cools and hardens before spreading far. It is sticky, that is, it has high viscosity. The magma forming this lava is often felsic, with high-to-intermediate levels of silica, and less mafic magma. Big felsic lava flows are uncommon, but have travelled as far as . Two famous stratovolcanoes are Japan's Mount Fuji, and Vesuvius. Both have big bases and steep sides that get steeper and steeper as it goes near the top. Vesuvius is famous for its destruction of the towns Pompeii and Herculaneum in 79AD, killing thousands. ==== Caldera ==== A caldera is a basin-like feature formed by collapse of land after a volcanic eruption. This happens after a huge stratovolcano blows its top off. The base of the crater then sinks, leaving a caldera where the top of the volcano was before. Krakatoa, best known for its catastrophic eruption in 1883, is much smaller now. == How volcanoes are formed == File:Volcano scheme.svg There are two main processes. Volcanoes are made when two tectonic plates come together. When these two plates meet, one of them (usually the oceanic plate) goes under the continental plate. This is the process of subduction. Afterwards, it melts and makes magma (inside the magma chamber), and the pressure builds up until the magma bursts through the Earth's crust. The second way is when a tectonic plate moves over a Hotspot (geology) in the Earth's crust. The hot spot works its way through the crust until it breaks through. The caldera of Yellowstone Park was formed in that way; so were the Hawaiian Islands. == Classification == File:Braun & Hogenberg 'Castrum Puellarum' (Edinburgh Castle) c.1581.jpg A wikt:traditional way to wikt:classify or wikt:identify volcanoes is by its pattern of Volcanic eruption. Those volcanoes which may erupt again at any time are called active volcano. Those that are now quiet are called dormant volcano (inactive). Those volcanoes which have not erupted in historical times are called extinct volcano. === Active === An active volcano is currently erupting, or it has erupted in the last 10,000 years. An example of an active volcano is Mount St. Helens in the United States (US). === Dormant (inactive) === A dormant volcano is "sleeping," but it could awaken in the future. Mount Rainier in the United States is considered dormant. === Extinct (dead volcano) === An extinct volcano has not erupted in the past 10,000 years. Edinburgh Castle in Scotland sits on top of an extinct volcano.University of Edinburgh, [http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/arthurseat/geology/geology.html "Holyrood Park Geology"] ; retrieved 2012-8-2. == Largest volcano on Earth == The Earth's largest volcano has been discovered.Witze, Alexandra 2013. Underwater volcano is Earth's biggest: Tamu Massif rivals the size of Olympus Mons on Mars. [http://www.nature.com/news/underwater-volcano-is-earth-s-biggest-1.13680] It is 2km below the sea on an underwater plateau known as the Shatsky Rise. This is about 1,600km east of Japan. The previous record-holder, Mauna Loa in Hawaii, is still the largest volcano on land. The 310,000km2 (119,000sq mi) volcano, Tamu Massif, is comparable in size to Mars' vast Olympus Mons volcano, which is the largest known volcano in the Solar System. It was formed about 145 million years ago when massive lava flows erupted from the centre of the volcano to form a broad, shield-like feature. That suggests the volcano produced a flood basalt eruption. The Tamu Massif extends some 30km (18miles) into the Earth's crust. The researchers doubted the submerged volcano's peak ever rose above sea level during its lifetime and say it is unlikely to erupt again. :"The bottom line is that we think that Tamu Massif was built in a short (geologically speaking) time of one to several million years and it has been extinct since", co-author William Sager of the University of Houston told the AFP news agency. :"There were lots of oceanic plateaus (that) erupted during the Cretaceous period (145-65 million years ago) but we don't see them since. Scientists would like to know why... The biggest oceanic plateau is Ontong Java Plateau, near the equator in the Pacific, east of the Solomon Islands. It is much bigger than Tamu it's the size of France".World's largest volcano discovered beneath Pacific. ''BBC Science & Environment''.
