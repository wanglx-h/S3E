His abdication as Spanish king is generally dated to 16 January 1556, although some give other dates. This was ratified in a document dated 17 February. On 3 August, he announced his abdication as emperor and instructed his commissioners to negotiate with Ferdinand and the electors the formal transfer of power.[https://ghdi.ghi-dc.org/docpage.cfm?docpage_id=5370&language=english The Abdication of Emperor Charles V / Kaiserliche Instruktion für die Abdikationsgesandtschaft zu Ferdinand I. und zu den Kurfürsten].

Philip the Handsome (son of Maximilian I of Austria and Mary of Burgundy) and Joanna the Mad (daughter of Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile) were his parents. He ruled Austria, Spain, Two Sicilies, Sardinia, Germany, Belgium, Holland, Luxembourg, Hungary, Bohemia, Croatia, Mexico, Peru, and Venezuela. ''His Majesty'' or ''His Imperial Majesty'' was first used when he was king. His Empire became large and was known as "in which the sun does not set". He was also known as "The Emperor of Universal Dominion." He divided his empire between his brother Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor and his son Philip II of Spain. ==Issue== Charles and Isabella had seven legitimate children, but only three of them survived to adulthood. Charles also had natural children before he married and after he was widowed. {| style="text-align:center" class="wikitable" |- ! Name !! style="width:100px;"| Portrait !! Lifespan !!
