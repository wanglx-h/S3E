Subject: Adam and Eve
'''Adam and Eve''' are the parents of all humans in the Abrahamic religions. In the Book of Genesis in the Bible, as well as the Qu'ran and the Aqdas, they are the first two people made by God. The Bible says that the ''Nāḥāš'' (translated as serpent) tempted Eve so she could eat the forbidden fruit of the Tree of Knowledge in the middle of the Garden of Eden, disobeying God's command. When Adam and Eve sinned, they were cast out of the Garden of Eden and cursed with pain, death, and sickness. In the Christian religion, the serpent is the Devil, a fallen angel and chief demon, who carries the titles of ''Lucifer'' ("Light bringer" or "Shining One") and ''Satan'' ("Accuser" or "Adversary"). ==Adam== The second chapter of Book of Genesis says that God made Adam from the dust of the ground. Then, God breathed life into him. God made a garden, called the Garden of Eden, for him to live in and take care of. Adam named the animals that God made. God did not provide clothing for Adam or Eve until they disobeyed him. He gave them tunics made out of animal fur when he banished them from Eden. .https://www.academia.edu/7170404/Shaggy_or_Shaved (Scroll down to page 12) Adam was given the honorary name of "Adam-I-Safi" meaning: THE CHOSEN ONEhttps://biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/ijt/07-2_056.pdf Bottom of page 57: "Adam was God's Chosen one "Adam-Safi" ==Eve== God knew that the animals were not good enough friends for Adam, who needed a partner like him. So God took a rib from Adam and used it to make Eve (meaning "mother of all living"). Adam did not give her this name until God banished them from Eden when he provided clothing for them out of animal fur after they disobeyed him. ==The fall and punishment== Chapter three of Book of Genesis says that Adam and Eve had everything they needed in the garden. There was only one thing that God told them that they should ''not'' do: eat from the Tree of Knowledge; only from the Tree of Life. The serpent told them that God does not want you both to be as intelligent as he is, so this convinced Eve to disobey God's orders. Once they ate the forbidden fruit, they were forced to leave Eden. Not only that, but God said that women would experience pain during childbirth, that men would have to work hard to grow food, and that he would return to the dust from which he came at death. ==Results of Adam's fall for everyone== Many Christians believe that because Adam sinned, his descendants are born inclined to evil. They cannot turn to God unless God first gives them Divine grace. This way God makes it possible for them to respond to Him and be Salvation (Christianity). https://www.anglicancommunion.org/media/109014/Thirty-Nine-Articles-of-Religion.pdf ==References== Category:Old Testament people
