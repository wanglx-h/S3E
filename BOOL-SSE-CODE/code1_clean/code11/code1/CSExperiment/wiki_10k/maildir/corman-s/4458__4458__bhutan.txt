Thus using the annual increase rate of 2–3%, the most population estimates were around 2 million in the year 2000. A national census was carried out in 2005 and it turned out that, 672,425 people lived there. Consequently, United Nations Population Division had down-estimated the country's population in the 2006 revision for the whole period from 1950 to 2050. | footnote2=The Indian rupee is also legal tender. }} '''Bhutan''' (officially called '''Kingdom of Bhutan''') is a small landlocked country in the Himalaya mountains of South Asia.
