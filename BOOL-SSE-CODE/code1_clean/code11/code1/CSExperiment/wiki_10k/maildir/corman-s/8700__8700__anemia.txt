File:Iron deficiency anemia blood film.jpg File:Sickle cell anemia.jpg '''Anemia''' (United States spelling), or '''anaemia''' (United Kingdom spelling), is the most common blood Disease. It is caused by not having enough hemoglobin or Red blood cell in the blood.

Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells responsible for carrying oxygen to different parts of the Human body. * Hemoglobinopathy * Iron deficiency anemia is the most common type of anemia overall ** Thalassemia ** Sickle-cell disease (once called ''sickle-cell anemia'') ===Normocytic anemia=== Normocytic anemia occurs when the number of red blood cells is lower than normal, and those cells have less hemoglobin than they should. This type of anemia is often caused by an underlying chronic condition. Treatment for normocytic anemia typically involves addressing the underlying illness. * Acute hemorrhage * Anemia of chronic disease] * Aplastic anemia (bone marrow failure) ===Macrocytic anemia=== Macrocytic anemia is a blood condition where the bone marrow produces unusually large red blood cells. These oversized cells lack the necessary nutrients to function properly. While macrocytic anemia itself is not a severe condition, it can lead to serious health complications if left untreated. * Alcoholism * Pernicious anemia is an Autoimmune disease with the parietal cells of the stomach * Megaloblastic anemia due to not having enough of either vitamin B12 or folic acid (or both) * Methotrexate, zidovudine, and other Drug that stop DNA replication. This is the most common cause in nonalcoholic Patient. ===Dimorphic anemia=== Dimorphic anemia includes two types of anemia at the same time. For example, macrocytic hypochromic, due to hookworm infestation leading to not enough of both iron and vitamin B12 or folic acid or following a blood transfusion. Category:Blood disorders
