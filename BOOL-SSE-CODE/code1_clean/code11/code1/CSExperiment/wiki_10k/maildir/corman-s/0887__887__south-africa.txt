About fifty-seven million people live there. South Africa is next to Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Lesotho, and eSwatini. The biggest city of South Africa is Johannesburg. The country has three Capital (city) for different purposes. They are Cape Town, Pretoria, and Bloemfontein. This is because the government is based in Pretoria, the parliament is in Cape Town and the Supreme Court is in Bloemfontein. There are 11 national languages. They are Afrikaans, English Language, Ndebele, Xhosa, Zulu language, Swati, Setswana, Sesotho, Sesotho sa Leboa, Venda and Tsonga. They are also known as National Lexicography Units (NLUs). Because of all the languages, the country has an wikt:official name in each language. One of South Africa's most well known people is Nelson Mandela. He was its President of South Africa from 1994 until 1999. He died in 2013 at the age of 95. The current president is Cyril Ramaphosa. Lions, cheetahs, zebras, giraffes, and many species of antelope live in South Africa. In terms of its resources, South Africa is one of the richest countries in Africa. ==History== Speakers of Bantu languages had settled south of the Limpopo River by the 4th or 5th century CE. They forced migration and wikt:conquered the Khoisan, Khoekhoe and San people people that lived there. Bantu peoples slowly moved south. The group that was the farthest south was the Xhosa people. Their language used some traits from the Khoisan people. The Xhosa reached the Great Fish River, in today's Eastern Cape Province. As they migration, these larger Iron Age groups displaced or cultural assimilation earlier groups. In Mpumalanga Province, several stone circles have been found, along with a stone arrangement that has been named Blaauboschkraal stone ruins. The ruins are thought to be created by the Bokoni, a Northern Sotho language people. The first European people to come to South Africa were Portuguese explorers. In 1487, Bartolomeu Dias found what he called the "Cape of Storms". The king of Portugal changed it to "Cape of Good Hope". He called it this because the cape gave the Portuguese a new chance to find a sea route to India. In 1652, Jan van Riebeeck colony the Cape. He started the camp for the Dutch East India Company. This was so that they could give fresh food to ships on their way to the south of Asia. There were very few wikt:native people living in the Cape. Because of this, slaves were brought from Indonesia, Madagascar and India to work at the colony. In 1795, Great Britain took the Cape from the Dutch East India Company, to stop France from taking it. The British gave it back in 1803 but then Annexation the Cape in 1807 when the Dutch East India Company went bankrupt. Diamonds were found in South Africa in 1867. Gold was found in 1884. This made a great number of people to come to South Africa from Europe. They were hoping to make money. The First Boer War happened in 1880-1881. The war was between the British and the Boers Republics. At that time, the British had the Cape. The Boer Republics were established when Dutch settlers moved north in the Great Trek. The British lost the war and came back 8 years later in 1899. They won this Second Boer War in 1902. The British had brought many more soldiers the second time. The Boers had no chance of winning. On 31 May 1910 the Union of South Africa was made from the Cape and Natal colonies. It was also made from Free State and the Transvaal. These were two Boer Republics. South Africa became much more independent when the Statute of Westminster 1931 was passed in 1931. The statute said that the Parliament of the United Kingdom could not pass laws in the country. In 1941, a system of racial discrimination called apartheid was started. It gave white people in South Africa more rights than black people. In 1961, South Africa became completely independent when the voters passed 1960 South African republic referendum to become a republic. Only white people were allowed to vote in the referendum. This republic ended apartheid in 1994. South Africa, Definition, Facts, Beginning, & End |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/apartheid|access-date=2022-05-15|website=Britannica|language=en}} == Geography == File:South Africa sat.jpg picture of South Africa|left|frameless]] South Africa is at the south end of Africa. It has a long coastline that reaches more than and along two oceans (the South Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean). At , South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world and is almost the size of Colombia. Njesuthi in the Drakensberg at is the highest part in South Africa. File:Drakensburgmountains.jpgThe majority of South Africa is the Central Plateau, bounded by the Great Scarp (landform). Its scrubland, the Karoo, is drier towards the northwest along the Namib desert. The eastern coastline however, is well-watered, which makes a climate similar to the tropics. To the north of Johannesburg, the wikt:altitude drops beyond the escarpment of the Highveld. It then turns into the lower lying Bushveld, an area of mixed dry forest and a lot of animal. East of the Highveld, beyond the eastern escarpment, the Lowveld reaches towards the Indian Ocean. It has mostly high temperatures, and is also the location of subtropical agriculture. === Climate === South Africa has a mostly temperate climate. It is surrounded by the Atlantic and Indian Oceans on three sides, and is located in the climatically milder southern hemisphere. Average wikt:elevation is higher towards the north (towards the equator) and further inland. Because of this wikt:vary topography and oceanic influence, different parts of South Africa have different climates. There is a desert in the southern Namib in the farthest northwest and subtropical climate in the east along the Mozambique border and the Indian Ocean. From the east, the land quickly rises over mountains towards the back plateau known as the Highveld. Even though South Africa is thought as semi-arid, there is a difference in climate as well as topography. The southwest has a climate similar to that of the Mediterranean with mild, moderately wet winters and hot, dry summers. This area also makes much of the wine in South Africa. This wikt:region is also mostly known for its wind, which blows almost all year. The wind can sometimes be severe when passing around the Cape of Good Hope mostly gets bad for sailors, making many shipwrecks. Further east on the south coast, rainfall falls more evenly throughout the year, making a green landscape. This area is popularly known as the Garden Route. The Orange Free State is mostly flat, because it lies in the center of the high plateau. North of the Vaal River, the Highveld becomes better watered and does not get subtropical heat. Johannesburg, in the center of the Highveld, is at 1,740 meter (5,709 foot (unit of length)) and gets a yearly rainfall of 740 millimeter (29.9 inch). Winters in this region are cold, although snow is rare. === Plants and wildlife === File:Fynbos.jpg unique to South Africa, near Cape Town]] South Africa is ranked sixth out of the world’s 17 megadiverse countries, with more than 20,000 different kinds of plants, or about 10% of all the known species of plants on Earth, making it very rich in plant biodiversity. The most common biome in South Africa is the grassland, mostly on the Highveld. This is where Poaceae, low shrubs, and acacia trees, mostly camel-thorn and whitethorn are more common than other plants. Plants become less common towards the northwest. This is because of low rainfall. There are many species of water-storing plants like aloes and euphorbias in the very hot and dry Namaqualand area. The grass and thorn savanna turns slowly into a bush savanna towards the north-east of the country, with more thick growth. There are many numbers of baobab trees in this area, near the northern end of Kruger National Park.[https://web.archive.org/web/20010410032655/http://www.southafrica-travel.net/pages/e_plants.htm Plants and Vegetation in South Africa], South Africa Online Travel Guide. == Economy == South Africa's economy is divided. It is divided between First World and Third World standards. The developed part of the economy is similar to that of most nations with wealth (for example, Britain or Australia). The rest of the economy is closer to that of poor nations, such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The main companies in South Africa are mining (mostly for gold and diamonds), car making, and Service Sector, such as insurance. Unemployment is very high. Income inequality is about the same as Brazil. During 1995–2003, the number of older jobs went down. Informal economy went up. Overall unemployment got worse. The wikt:average South African household income went down a lot between 1995 and 2000. As for racial inequality, Statistics South Africa said that in 1995 the average white household earned four times as much as the average African Americans household. In 2000 the average white family was earning six times more than the average black household. The action policies have seen a rise in black economic wealth. There is a developing black middle class.[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/jan/22/southafrica.features Race against time]. The Observer. 22 January 2006. Other problems are crime, corruption, and HIV/AIDS. South Africa suffers from mostly heavy overall wikt:regulation compared to developed countries. labor rules have added to the unemployment weakness. == Population == South Africa is a nation of about 50million people of diverse wikt:origins, cultures, languages, and religions. The last census was held in 2001 and the next will be in 2011. Statistics South Africa had five racial categories by which people could classify themselves, the last of which, "unspecified/other" drew "not needed" responses, and these results were not counted.[https://web.archive.org/web/20040831200743/http://www.statssa.gov.za/census01/html/default.asp Census 2001], Statistics South Africa. The 2009 middle-year estimated figures for the other categories were Black African at 79.3%, White at 9.1%, Coloured at 9.0%, and Asian at 2.6%. Even though the population of South Africa has grown in the past decade (mostly because of immigration), the country had an yearly population growth rate of −0.501% in 2008 (CIA est.), counting immigration. The CIA thinks that in 2009 South Africa's population started to grow again, at a rate of 0.281%. South Africa is home to an estimated 5million illegal immigrants, counting about 3million Zimbabweans. A series of anti-immigrant riots happened in South Africa beginning on 11 May 2008. ==Provinces== File:Map of South Africa with English labels.svg South Africa is divided into 9 provinces. The provinces are in turn divided into 52 districts: 8 metropolitan and 44 district municipalities. The district municipalities are further divided into 226 local municipalities. {| class="wikitable sortable" style="text-align: right;" |- ! Province ! Provincial capital ! Largest city !

Johannesburg 2. Cape Town 3. Durban 4. Pretoria == Society and culture == File:CuisineSouthAfrica.jpg File:SouthAfricaDecoratedHouses.jpg It may be suggested that there is no single South African culture because of its ethnic wikt:diversity. Today, the diversity in foods from many cultures is enjoyed by all and marketed to tourists who wish to taste South African food. Food is not the only thing, music and dance is there too. South African food is mostly meat-based and has wikt:spawn the South African social gathering known as a ''braai'', or barbecue. South Africa has also developed into a big wine maker. It has some of the best vineyards lying in valleys around Stellenbosch, Franschoek, Paarl and Barrydale. South Africa is the only country of Africa with a significant ethnic European population and influence Most South African blacks still have poor lives. It is among these people, however, that cultural traditions live most strongly. This is because blacks have become city and Western civilization, much parts of traditional culture have fallen. Urban blacks normally speak English or Afrikaans in addition to their native tongue. There are smaller but still important groups of speakers of Khoisan (language) languages who are not in the 11 official languages, but are one of the eight other officially recognized languages. Members of middle class, who are mostly white but whose ranks are growing numbers of black, colored and Indian people, have lifestyles similar in many ways to that of people found in Western Europe, North America and Australasia. Members of the middle class often study and work from foreign countries for greater exposure to the markets of the world. Approximately 9,800 Roma gypsies live in South Africa. === Religion === File:Graaff-Reinet GR3.jpg According to the 2001 national census, Christians accounted for 79.7Percent of the population. This has Zion Christian (11.1%), Pentecostalism (Charismatic) (8.2%), Roman Catholic (7.1%), Methodist (6.8%), Dutch Reformed (6.7%), Anglican (3.8%); members of other Christian churches accounted for another 36% of the population. Muslims accounted for 1.5% of the population, Hinduism about 1.3%, and Judaism 0.2%. 15.1% had no religious affiliation, 2.3% were other and 1.4% were unspecified.For a discussion of Church membership statistics in South Africa please refer to Forster, D. "God's mission in our context, healing and transforming responses" in Forster, D and Bentley, W. ''Methodism in Southern Africa: A celebration of Wesleyan Mission''. Kempton Park. AcadSA publishers (2008:97-98) === Sports === South Africa's most liked sports are soccer, rugby union and cricket. Other sports that are popular are swimming, athletics, golf, boxing, tennis and netball. Soccer is the most liked among youth. There are other sports like basketball, surfing and skateboarding that are becoming more liked. File:GraemeSmith.jpg's former captain]] Famous boxers from South Africa are Baby Jake Jacob Matlala, Vuyani Bungu, Welcome Ncita, Dingaan Thobela, Gerrie Coetzee and Brian Mitchell. There are football players who have played for major wikt:foreign clubs. Some of them are Lucas Radebe and Philemon Masinga (both were of Leeds United A.F.C.), Quinton Fortune (Atletico Madrid and Manchester United F.C.), Benni McCarthy (Ajax Amsterdam, F.C. Porto and Blackburn Rovers F.C.), Aaron Mokoena (Ajax Amsterdam, Blackburn Rovers and Portsmouth F.C.), Delron Buckley (Borussia Dortmund) and Steven Pienaar (Ajax Amsterdam and Everton F.C.). South Africa made Formula One motor racing's 1979 world champion Jody Scheckter. Famous current cricket players are Herschelle Gibbs, Graeme Smith, Jacques Kallis, JP Duminy and more. Most of them also participate in the Indian Premier League. South Africa has also made many world class rugby players. Some of them are Francois Pienaar, Joost van der Westhuizen, Danie Craven, Frik du Preez, Naas Botha, and Bryan Habana. South Africa hosted and won the 1995 Rugby World Cup at their first try. They won the 2007 Rugby World Cup in France. South Africa was only allowed to wikt:participate from 1995 since the end of Apartheid. It followed the 1995 Rugby World Cup by hosting the 1996 African Cup of Nations. It had the national team, 'Bafana Bafana,' going on to win the tournament. It also hosted the 2003 Cricket World Cup. and the 2007 World Twenty20 Championship. Both of them were a great success. In 2010, South Africa became the first African nation to host the 2010 World Cup. The South Africa national football team has competed in three World Cups. It bid for the right to stage the 2004 Olympic Games, but finished third to Athens. South Africa is also well known for their South Africa national cricket team. They are right now the world's number one in test match cricket. === Education === The main schools span the first seven years of schooling. In the age of Apartheid, schools for blacks were subject to judgment. They often did not get enough funding because of their skin color, and other unfair treatment. Instruction can take place in Afrikaans as well. Public payment on education was at 5.4% of the 2002-05 GDP. == Foreign relations == *A meeting between the Donald Trump and the Cyril Ramaphosa, happened as late as 2025.https://www.vg.no/nyheter/i/Jb8GbR/trump-viste-videoer-han-hevder-viser-folkemord-mot-hvite-soerafrikanere-i-moete-med-landets-president.
