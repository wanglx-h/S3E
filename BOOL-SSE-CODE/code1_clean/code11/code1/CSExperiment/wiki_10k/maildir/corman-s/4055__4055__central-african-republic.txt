It is mostly a plateau or high, flat piece of land about 941metres above the sea. The CAR covers a land area of about , and has an estimated population of about 4.4 million as of 2008. Bangui is the capital city. ==Background== There are thick forests in the south, and these are home to rare gorillas. This part of Africa also has Pygmies. Other important towns are Bouar, Zinga, and Ouadda. Its southern border is the Ubangi River. There are 3.8 million people in the C.A.R. Most of them belong to the Banda people and Baya tribes. The main language is French language but some people speak the national language of Sango language. The people mostly grow their own food, but sometimes droughts (long spells without any rain) make this difficult. The C.A.R. also has diamond and uranium mines. It sells these, as well as cotton, coffee, and timber to other countries to make money. The currency used is the CFA Franc - 1 US Dollar is worth 590.3 CFA Francs. The country was ruled by France until 1960 when it became independent. The country has not been very stable since then, with multiple Civil war, and corruption. In April 2022, the country made bitcoin a legal tender, becoming the second country in the world to adopt the cryptocurrency. ==Geography== File:Ubangi river near Bangui.jpg on the outskirts of Bangui]] The Central African Republic is a landlocked nation.
