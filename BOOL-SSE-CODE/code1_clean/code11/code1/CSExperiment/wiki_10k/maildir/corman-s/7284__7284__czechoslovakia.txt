It split off from Austria-Hungary in 1918 and split apart in 1993. In mid-1938 Nazi Germany took over Czechoslovakia and split off Slovakia. Sudetenland was annexed by Germany, other parts of Czechia became its protectorate named Bohemia and Moravia. After World War II the USSR liberated these lands and kept Zakarpattia Oblast because of the Ukrainians (Rusyns) majority in that region. By 1948 pro-Soviet communists got the power finally and declared the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. It was a member of Warsaw Pact and Council for Mutual Economic Assistance , one of the richest countries of the Eastern Bloc. In the Prague Spring of the late 1960s, Czechoslovak leader Alexander Dubček pursued his own policy of a ‘socialism with a human face’. In 1968 Warsaw Pact troops invaded Czechoslovakia to restore the old system. In 1989 Czechoslovakia peacefully changed its political system in the ''Velvet Revolution''. On 1 January 1993, Czechoslovakia split into the '''Czech Republic '''and''' Slovakia'''. The countries separated in peace. ==Official names== *1918–1920: '''Czechoslovak Republic (1918–1938)''' (abbreviated RČS)/'''Czecho-Slovak State''', or Czecho-Slovakia/Czechoslovakia *1920–1938: '''Czechoslovak Republic (1918–1938)''' (ČSR), or Czechoslovakia *1938–1939: '''Second Czechoslovak Republic''', or Czecho-Slovakia *1945–1960: '''Third Czechoslovak Republic''' (ČSR), or Czechoslovakia *1960–1990: '''Czechoslovak Socialist Republic''' (ČSSR), or Czechoslovakia *April 1990: Czech and Slovak Federative Republic (Czech version) and Czecho-Slovak Federative Republic (Slovak version) **The country subsequently became the '''Czech and Slovak Federative Republic''', ČSFR, or Československo (Czech version) and Česko-Slovensko (Slovak version).
