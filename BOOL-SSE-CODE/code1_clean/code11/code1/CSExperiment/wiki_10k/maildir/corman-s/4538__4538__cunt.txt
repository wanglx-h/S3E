'''Cunt''' is an abuse word that is used against people as an insult. It can also be slang, for the vagina, or vulva. Unlike many words of profanity that came from Anglo-Saxon, this word came from a Latin one (''cuneus'', meaning a wedge shape). After the Normandy invasion of England, it replaced the native word for vagina, 'mægeþblæd'. Category:Pejoratives Category:English profanity
