''Renaissance'' is a French language word for “cultural rebirth.” During this period, there was a “rebirth” of Classical antiquity. People started relearning the teachings of scholars from Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome, and other Ancient history societies. The Renaissance is often said to be the start of the Modern history. During the Renaissance, there were many advances in art, literature, the sciences, mathematics, and culture. Many famous artists, writers, philosophy, and scientists lived during this period. A person who is clever at a great number of things is sometimes called a "Renaissance man." The most famous Renaissance man was Leonardo da Vinci, a Painting, scientist, musician, and Philosophy. The Renaissance started in Italy but soon spread throughout Europe. In Italy, the period is divided into three parts: * the [http://www.artcyclopedia.com/history/early-renaissance.html Early Renaissance] * the [http://www.artcyclopedia.com/history/high-renaissance.html High Renaissance] * the [https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/renaissance-reformation/mannerism1/a/a-beginners-guide-to-mannerism Late Renaissance] ''(also called the "Mannerist period") Following the Mannerism period was the Baroque period, which also spread across Europe starting around 1600. Outside Italy, it can be hard to tell when the Renaissance period ended and the Baroque began. == Causes == File:Press1520.png === Reading and printing === In the Middle Ages, most Art, Law, and History production took place in and around books. Monastery, churches, university, and rich people them produced and owned books. They were produced entirely by hand and so were called manuscripts; illuminated manuscripts include handcolored, drawn, and gilded pictures. Most books were written in Greek language or Latin, which was used in the Catholic Church. Only priests and well-educated people could read Latin. People were forbidden by church law from translating the Bible into Italian language, English language, German language, French language, or other local languages. Around 1440, the first printed books were made in Europe. The printing press made it possible to print copies of large books like the Bible and to sell them cheaply. It took 300 calf skins or 100 pig skins to print the Bible. printings soon began to print everything that they thought was interesting: Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome writings, poetry, and Play (theatre); stories about the lives of the Canonization; mathematics textbooks; Medicine textbooks; Christian story; eroticism; books about animals and monsters; maps of the world; and advice to princes about on to rule. Before the invention of the printing press, knowledge had belonged to priests, monasteries, and universities. Suddenly many thousands of people, even merchants, could learn far more than they ever could before. File:Na Koloseum i K Franciszki Rzymianki.JPG.

The white front of the Church of St. Francesca is from the 1600s. All of the columns and broken walls are from Ancient Rome buildings. The circular building to the left is now a church but was once an ancient temple.]] === Ancient Roman things === From about 400 BC to 400 AD, Europe experienced a Golden age. In Ancient Greece and Rome, there were many philosophers, writers, painters, sculptors, architects and mathematicians. Things were beautiful, well-organized, and well run. However, by the year 1400, the city of Rome was in ruins. Inside the broken walls, which had been smashed in 410 AD, were the remains of huge temples, stadium, Bathhouse, apartment blocks and palaces. Nearly all of them were half-buried and ruined and so they could not be used. Many were pulled down to use as building stone. Among the ruins of the once-great city, the people of Rome lived in cottages. They still went to church in the huge churches (basilicas) that had been built by the first Christian emperor, Constantine the Great, in the 4th century. They still held market day in the ancient Roman market of ''Campo dei Fiori'' ("Field of Flowers"). In 1402, Filippo Brunelleschi and the teenager Donatello came to Rome. They were probably the world's first archaeology. They were fascinated by everything that they saw. They measured ancient ruined buildings, drew things, and dug around for weeks looking for bits of broken statues and painted pottery that they could put back together. When they went back home to Florence, they knew more about ancient Roman architecture and sculpture than anyone had known for about a thousand years. Brunelleschi became a very famous architect, and Donatello became a very famous sculptor. === Money and politics === File:FlorenceSkyline.jpg has not changed very much since the 1400s.]] The Renaissance really began in the city of Florence. In those days, Italy was not one single country but was made of many little states. All of them were governed in different ways and were constantly making alliances and fighting one other. Rome was Politics powerfu, because the city had the Pope, the head of the Roman Catholic Church. Because of his very great importance as a spiritual leader, most people and most cities did not want to argue with him. After a pope died, a new pope was elected. Rich and powerful people hoped that a member of their family would be chosen. It was always a good idea to have several young men in the family trained as Priest just in case. It also helped to be good friends with other rich families. One way to do so was to have many daughters and to get them to marry rich and powerful men from different cities, which was how politics then worked. There were other powerful cities in Italy. Venice had a large and powerful navy. Milan controlled trade with Northern Europe and was very rich. Genoa was also very rich because it controlled trade with France and Spain. Florence, where the Renaissance is said to have started, was another important city. Florence’s strength came from a strong army, strong fortress, or control over trade but came from finance. The ruling House of Medici were an important banking family and helped to make Florence a powerful city and the centre of Renaissance learning. == List of important events of the Renaissance == === In art === File:Sandro Botticelli - La nascita di Venere - Google Art Project - edited.jpg]] File:Rome San Pietro.jpg began during the Renaissance.]] File:Proportions of the Head.jpg's study of the human head]] * 1401: Lorenzo Ghiberti wins a competition to create the Florence ''Baptistry Doors''.
