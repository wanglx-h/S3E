File:A size illustration.svg Paper comes in different sizes. There are names for the different sizes of paper. In different parts of the world, different sizes and names are used. There are also envelope sizes made to fit different kinds of paper. Envelope sizes are normally wider to fit the paper inside. == International sizes == In most of the world an international system of paper sizes is used. The normal size of paper is called '''A4'''. It is measured in metric system. It is 210 millimetres wide and 297 millimetres long. This is about the size of '''US letter''', but it is a little narrower, and a little longer. The Deutsches Institut für Normung chose this standard in 1922 and other countries soon followed. The other common size of paper in Europe is called '''B5'''. It is 176 millimetres wide by 250 millimetres long. This is about the same as '''executive''' size in the United States. It is sometimes used for writing personal letters to people. There are also many other paper sizes used for writing notes, for big posters, for books, and for other things. In the international paper size system, the sizes are based on mathematics. '''A0''' is the biggest at 1 square metre. '''A1''' is half as big as '''A0'''. '''A2''' is half as big as '''A1''', and so on. The sizes with "'''B'''" and "'''C'''" in their name are in between the "'''A'''" sizes. == Sizes in North America == In the United States, Mexico and Canada the normal size of paper is called '''letter''' size, or sometimes '''US letter'''. It is inches wide and 11 inches long (216 279 mm). The other common size of paper in the US is called '''legal''', or sometimes '''US legal'''. It is also inches wide, but it is 14 inches long. It is similar to the size called foolscap in Britain. Another size is called '''executive'''. It is inches wide by inches long. It is not very common. It is sometimes used for writing personal Letter (paper) to people. There is also a size called '''tabloid'''. It is 11 inches wide, and 17 inches long. That is the same size as two pieces of '''letter''' size put next to each other. There are also many other paper sizes used for writing notes, for big posters, for books, and for other things. == Paper sizes and computer printers == Most computer printer used with computers are designed to fit '''US letter''' and '''A4''', and smaller paper sizes. Sometimes they can fit '''US legal''' also. For larger paper sizes, printers at professional printing businesses may be needed. == Details == Below are charts showing all the different sizes of paper that are usually made, listed in increasing order of size. Dimensions are shown width first, then length. If a company wants to make something with a different size of paper than these, they have to have it specially cut for them. {| class="wikitable" |+ US/Canada Paper Sizes !Name ! Inches !! mm !!
