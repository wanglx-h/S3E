File:WorldMapLongLat-eq-circles-tropics-non.png The '''latitude''' of the Earth gives the distance north or south of the equator. It is measured in degrees. Latitude is represented by the Greek letter phi (letter), \phi\,\!. It is usually used along with a measurement of longitude in order to pinpoint a location on Earth. The equator is numbered 0 degrees. Everything north or south of the equator is designated either as '''north latitude''' or '''south latitude'''. The north pole is 90 degrees north, and the south pole is 90 degrees south. The Antarctic Circle, Tropic of Capricorn, Tropic of Cancer, and Arctic Circle are all circles of latitude. == Related pages == * Longitude == References == Category:Lines of latitude == Other websites == * [http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/Latitude Latitude Citizendium]
