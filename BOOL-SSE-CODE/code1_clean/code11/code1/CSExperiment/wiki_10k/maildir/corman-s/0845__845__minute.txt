A '''minute''' is a customary unit of time. It is equal to 60 seconds. There are 60 minutes in an hour. Unlike the second, the minute is not an SI unit. A minute is also of a degree (geometry). In this context, a minute is also called an '''arcminute''', and is written with the ' symbol. For example, the Sun and Moon both have angular diameters of about 30 arcminutes—when seen from Earth.
