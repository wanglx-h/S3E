As such, right-libertarianism in the United States remains a fruitful discourse with which to articulate conservative claims, even as it lacks political efficacy as a separate ideology. However, even without its own movement, libertarian sensibility informs numerous social movements in the United States, including the U.S. patriot movement, the gun-rights movement, and the incipient Tea Party movement.}} }} | headquarters = 310 First Street SE,Washington, D.C., U.S. | international = * International Democracy Union ** Asia Pacific Democracy Union ** European Conservatives and Reformists Party (global partner) | website = | country = the United States | abbreviation = GOP | founders = Alvan E.

Since the mid-1850's, the party's main opponent has been the Democratic Party (United States). Both political parties have controlled American politics ever since. The party sits at the Right-wing politics of the Politics of the United States, with the Democratic Party being positioned to their Centre-left politics. However, there also factions of the Republican Party that are center-right to Far-right politics. Ideologically, Republicans favor fiscal and social conservatism. It opposes single-payer healthcare, Abortion debate, euthanasia, Labour union, affirmative action, Marijuana, Same-sex marriage and a high minimum wage. It advocates for Tax, limited government, gun rights, Free market, traditional values and free trade. It did, however, hold Protectionism opinions during its early days, for example during Theodore Roosevelt’s presidency. It also held anti-free trade opinions during Donald Trump’s presidency. The symbol of the Republican party is the elephant. This symbol was first used in 1874 in a political cartoon by Thomas Nast.[http://www.harpweek.com/09Cartoon/BrowseByDateCartoon.asp?Year=2003&Month=November&Date=7 Cartoon of the Day: "The Third-Term Panic"]. Retrieved on 2008-09-01. The Republican National Committee, or the RNC, is the main organization for the Republican Party in all 50 states. The Republican Party is not the same political party as the Democratic-Republican Party. A state where most voters vote for Republican politicians is called a Red states and blue states. ==History== The Republican Party was founded in Ripon, Wisconsin in 1853, with the help of Francis Preston Blair. The Republican Party was formed by people who did not like the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854, which would let each territory allow slavery. The Republican Party was founded by past members of the Free Soil Party and the Whig Party (United States) who wanted to stop the expansion of slavery. The founders of the Republican Party wanted to stop the expansion of slavery because they believed it was against the ideals of the United States Constitution and United States Declaration of Independence. Some founders of the Republican Party wanted to Abolitionism everywhere in the United States. The Republican Party's first candidate for president of the United States was John C. Frémont in 1856. As the Whig Party collapsed, the Republicans became one of two major political parties in the United States (the Democratic Party was the other major political party). In 1860 Abraham Lincoln, the first Republican president, was 1860 United States presidential election. For the rest of the second half of the 19th century, the country had mostly Republican presidents. From 1860 until 1912 the Republicans lost the presidential election just twice (non-consecutively to Democrat Grover Cleveland in 1884 and 1892). Republicans believed in protectionism (the belief that raising taxes on trades with other countries would protect the economy) during the second half of the 19th century and during the early half of the 20th century. After World War I, the 1920s had three Republican presidents: Warren Harding, Calvin Coolidge, and Herbert Hoover. It was called the Republican Decade for that reason. Harding and Coolidge made a plan for the economy which lowered taxes, made the Federal government of the United States spend less money, and got rid of rules and laws that affected the economy. Near the end of the 1920s, the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the Great Depression began. During the Great Depression, the Republican Party became less popular. No Republicans were president between 1933 and 1953, when Dwight Eisenhower began his first of two consecutive terms as president (he was 1956 United States presidential election in 1956). Richard Nixon lost the 1960 United States presidential election in 1960 but was 1968 United States presidential election president on the Republican ticket in 1968 and 1972 United States presidential election in 1972. Ronald Reagan, an actor and conservative political activist, was 1980 United States presidential election as president in 1980. Ronald Reagan became the first Republican president who was a former member of the Democratic Party (United States). Ronald Reagan served two terms and his successor George H.W. Bush served one term. Reagan wanted fewer laws to affect the economy and wanted the Military of the United States to be stronger. Bill Clinton (a Democrat) was 1992 United States presidential election president in 1992, and 1996 United States presidential election in 1996. However, a new United States Congress was elected in 1996, and Republicans gained control of both the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate. They voted against many of Clinton's ideas and proposed ideas of their own such as a line-item veto and a balanced budget amendment. In 2000 United States presidential election, George W. Bush was elected president, defeating Al Gore in a very close election. Bush was re-elected in 2004 United States presidential election. After elections held in 2006, Republicans lost control of Congress. Democrat Barack Obama was 2008 United States presidential election in 2008 and 2012 United States presidential election in 2012. Republican John Boehner was elected the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives in 2010 and re-elected in 2012. In 2014, Republicans gained control of the Senate and the House. Boehner resigned in early October 2015 and was eventually succeeded by Paul Ryan of Wisconsin on October 29, 2015. On November 9, 2016, Donald Trump was United States presidential election, 2016 president, defeating Democrat Hillary Clinton in the U.S. Electoral College. Trump was the first Republican to take office as president since January 20, 2001, when George W. Bush was inaugurated. The Republicans lost the House and won the Senate in 2018. Paul Ryan retired in 2019 and was succeeded by Nancy Pelosi, who is a member of the Democratic Party. In 2020 United States presidential election, the Republicans lost the presidency when Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump. In 2022, they were able to get control back of the House of Representatives, but not the Senate. In 2024 United States presidential election, the Republicans won the presidency again when Donald Trump defeated Kamala Harris. They were also able to hold their control of the House of Representatives, as well as gain control of the Senate. == Republican beliefs == Currently, the Republican Party is identified by classical liberalism, conservatism, and right-wing policies.
