'''Medical ethics''' is the set of ethics rules that medical doctors follow. These ethics guide doctors as to how they should treat patients. The earliest set of ethical ideas in medicine was the ''Hippocratic oath'' (an oath is an important promise). It was supposed to be written by Hippocrates. == Principles == There are 6 major principles (important ideas): * Beneficences - a doctor must do things that are good for the ''patient'' (the doctor is giving medicine care to.) * Non-maleficence – a doctor must not try to hurt his patients. * Autonomy - the patient can say he does not want to be treated * :wikt:justice – talks about what is fair in giving people medicines and care. It talks about who gets what treatments. * Dignity - the patient (and the doctor) have the right to dignity (respect for someone as a person) * Truthfulness (being honest) – the doctor must tell the patient the truth == Medical ethics questions == Here are some kinds of medical ethics questions: * If there is not enough of a medicine to treat every person who has a disease who should get the medicine? * If a baby has a disease that will kill him very soon, what should a doctor do if the baby's mother says she does not want the baby to be helped? * A patient has an injury that cannot be helped and that will kill them in a few minutes. The patient asks a doctor “am I going to die?” What should the doctor say? *If a man has stage four cancer but only wants hollistic medicine, should you treat him with chemotherapy anyway? ==Related pages== *Bioethics *Conflict of interest *Deontological ethics *Informed consent *Right to die Category:Medicine Category:Ethics
