'''Sartell''' is a city in the U.S. state of Minnesota. The 2020 United States Census said 19,351 people live in the city. Sartell is in both Stearns County, Minnesota and Benton County, Minnesota. ==History== Sartell started as a small town near the Mississippi River. It was first named "The Third Rapids" because it was the third rapids that French Fur trades came to as they went north from St. Anthony Falls in Minneapolis, Minnesota. One of the first people to live in this young town was Joseph B. Sartell. He came in 1854 and worked as a millwright at a local sawmill. In 1877, he started a flour mill at the nearby Watab River. In 1884, he started the Sartell Brothers Lumber Company with his sons. In 1905, some people started to build the Watab Pulp and Paper Company. They also started to build the Sartell Dam across the Mississippi near the "third rapids". Both of these things were finished in 1907. Seven people died when building the dam. Since that time, Watab Pulp and Paper was rebuilt several times and many people bought and sold it. Now a company called International Paper owns it. It was in 1907 that residents of the town decided it was time to Incorporated Several influential people felt the town ought to be named "Wengert" after a local businessman. Another man lobbyied to have the town named "Oberly" after himself. However, because of his many relatives and generous contributions to the community, the town was incorporated as "The Village of Sartell" in honor of Joseph B. Sartell. From 1907 until 1973, there was a Sartell on nearly every City Council, the most prominent being Ripley B. "Rip" Sartell who was mayor for 31 years. The town continued to grow slowly and developed a number of businesses and a "downtown" on the east side of the Mississippi along U.S. Highway 10. In the 1960s, the highway was re-routed and the downtown area suffered. The later construction of a new bridge over the Mississippi in the early 1980s replaced the remaining businesses. This and Sartell’s move to St. Cloud, Minnesota's major retail center account for Sartell's lack of a traditional "downtown". Because residents wanted to educate their children locally, Independent School District #748, Sartell-St. Stephen, was created in 1969. Despite not having a downtown the city continued to grow and the pace of the growth increased in the 1970s. From 1970 to the present, the population of the city has grown from 700 to nearly 20,000. ==Government== Sartell's city council has a mayor and four Councillors.
