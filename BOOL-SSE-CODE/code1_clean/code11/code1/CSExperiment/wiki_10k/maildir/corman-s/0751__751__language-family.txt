File:Primary Human Languages Improved Version.png '''Language families''' are groups of Language that are related to each other because they come from a common older language. The languages in a family have similar vocabulary or structure. For example, French language and Spanish language both come from Latin language. Latin was spoken a long time ago, and some of the people who spoke it started to speak different ways - for the word "good", one group started saying "bueno" while another group started saying "bon". Most words are said a little differently in Spanish language and French language, so the two are called different languages. Most languages belong to a language family, but some languages do not. These languages are called language isolates. There also are constructed languages, such as Esperanto. Constructed languages are made for different reasons (for example, making a 'world language', for fun, or for use in fiction, like with Klingon language). ==Major language families== ===By number of languages=== ''Ethnologue'' 22 (2019) lists these language families as "major".
