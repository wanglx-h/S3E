Subject: Sex Pistols
The '''Sex Pistols''' were the first popular punk group in Britain and one of the first bands to come from the rising U.K. punk scene of the late 1970s. They were only together for about 3 years, from late 1975 to early 1978, and they were known for their rowdy behaviour more than their music. The music they made gave many new artists a big influence on their music, mostly in the Alternative rock and punk scenes such as California punk rock group Green Day. The band members were Johnny Rotten (vocals), Paul Cook (drums), Steve Jones (guitar) and Glen Matlock (bass). Sid Vicious later replaced Matlock on bass in February 1977 but died 2 years later. They recorded only one studio album, called ''Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols'' during the summer of 1977. One of their most famous songs is "Anarchy In The UK". Another one of their most famous songs is "God Save the Queen (Sex Pistols song)", which was banned by the BBC for it's contents. They split up after a show at Winterland on January 14th, 1978, with Rotten saying "You ever get the feelin' you're bein' cheated?" == Albums == * ''Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols'' (1977) *The Great Rock n' Roll Swindle (1979) (Soundtrack to a film of the same name) *Flogging A Dead Horse (1980) (Greatest Hits Compilation Album) == Other websites == * [http://www.sex-pistols.net God Save The Sex Pistols] * [http://www.johnlydon.com/jlhome.html John Lydon Official Site] * [http://www.thefilthandthefury.co.uk/home.htm The Filth and the Fury] * [http://www.bobgruen.com/files/sexpistols.html Photographs by Bob Gruen] Category:1975 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:1978 disestablishments in the United Kingdom Category:1970s British music groups Category:English punk bands Category:Musical groups established in 1975 Category:Musical groups disestablished in the 1970s Category:Musical groups from London Category:Sex Pistols
