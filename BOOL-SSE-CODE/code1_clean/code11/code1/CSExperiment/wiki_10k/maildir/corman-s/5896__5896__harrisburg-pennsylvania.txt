As of the 2020 United States Census, the city has 50,099 people living in it. Harrisburg is the county seat of Dauphin County, Pennsylvania and is on the Susquehanna River, 105 miles (169km) northwest of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Originally the home to Native Americans, John Smith of Jamestown first made contact with them in 1608. In 1719, English trader John Harris, Sr. built a home on the bank of the river, and by 1785 obtained the land from William Penn, creating the settlement of "Harrisburg" named after Harris. ==Related pages== *Three Mile Island accident ==Notes and References== == Other websites == *[http://www.harrisburgpa.gov/ City of Harrisburg official website] Category:County seats in Pennsylvania Category:Harrisburg, Pennsylvania Category:State capitals in the United States Category:1791 establishments in the United States Category:1790s establishments in Pennsylvania
