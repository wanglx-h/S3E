By January 1996, Dole was more open to talk about ending the shutdown, but was not supported by other Republicans who wanted the shutdown to continue. Gingrich and Dole had a hard time working together. Many people thought that both of them might want to run for the 1996 Republican presidential nomination.

However, Bush beat Dole in the New Hampshire primary a week later. During the New Hampshire primaries, Dole lost his temper in a television interview with Tom Brokaw and said that Bush should "stop lying about my record".

Several days later, every southern state voted for Bush during Super Tuesday. He eventually lost Illinois to Bush and afterwards dropped out of the race. ===1996 presidential campaign=== File:1996 1st Presidential Debate F.png at the first presidential debate in October 1996]] On April 10, 1995, Dole announced his candidacy for the 1996 Republican Party presidential primaries for president, in his third campaign for the presidency.

He made former Congressman and supply-side economics supporter Jack Kemp his running mate for vice president. Clinton said Dole was similar to the House Speaker, Newt Gingrich. He warned that Dole would work with the Republican Congress to cut popular social programs, like Medicare (United States) and Social Security (United States). Dole's tax-cut plan was attacked by the White House. They said it would "blow a hole in the deficit spending". Some people were worried about Dole's age. On September 18, 1996 at a rally in Chico, California, he was reaching down to shake the hand of a supporter, when the railing on the stage broke and he fell four feet. Many compared the fall between Dole to a younger Clinton. At the end of October 1996, Dole and his advisers knew that they would lose the election, but in the last four days of the campaign they went on the "96-hour victory tour" to help Republican Congressional candidates. Dole lost to President Clinton, with a 379–159 United States Electoral College landslide victory. Clinton won 49.2% of the vote against Dole's 40.7% and Ross Perot's 8.4%.
