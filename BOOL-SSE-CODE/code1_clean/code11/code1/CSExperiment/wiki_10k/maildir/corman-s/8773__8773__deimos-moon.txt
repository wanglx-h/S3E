Its name comes from the Greek word for terror. Its orbital period is 30.3 hours, which is 1.263 days. Deimos is only 15 kilometers in diameter. It is covered with craters, as Earth's moon and other bodies without an atmosphere are. == Discovery and naming == Deimos was discovered by Asaph Hall at the United States Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C. on 12 August 1877. It is named after the god Deimos (mythology) in Greek mythology, who was one of Mars' sons, and means Panic. == Physical characteristics == Deimos is not spherical with triaxial dimensions of 15 × 12.2 × 11 km. Deimos is made up of rock (geology) rich in Carbonaceous chondrite material. It is has lots of Crater. Escape velocity from Deimos is 5.6 m/s. The apparent magnitude of Deimos is 12.45. == Exploration == The Soviet Phobos program sent two probes to Phobos. In case ''Phobos 1'' succeeded, ''Phobos 2'' could have been sent to Deimos. Both probes launched successfully in July 1988. In 1997 and 1998, the proposed ''Aladdin'' mission was selected. The plan was to visit both Phobos and Deimos, and launch Projectile at the Natural satellite. The probe would collect the dust kicked into Outer space as it made a slow flyby. These samples would be returned to Earth for study three years later. Also, the sample-return mission called ''Gulliver'' to Deimos, in bringing 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds) of material from Deimos to Earth. Another concept of sample-return mission from Phobos (moon) and Deimos is ''OSIRIS-REx 2'', which would use heritage from the first ''OSIRIS-REx''. In March 2014, a mission was proposed to place an orbiter on Mars orbit by 2021 and study Phobos and Deimos. It is called ''Phobos And Deimos & Mars Environment'' (PADME). ==References== Category:Moons of Mars
