File:Sandro Botticelli - La nascita di Venere - Google Art Project - edited.jpg]] '''''The Birth of Venus''''' is a painting by Sandro Botticelli (1445 – May 17, 1510). It is of a Roman goddess who was called Venus (mythology). He pictured her standing on a shell because Venus was said to have been born from foam on the sea in ''Stanze per la giostra'', a poem written by Angelo Poliziano. The painting shows Zephyr, god of the winds holding the gentle breeze Aura, blowing her toward the shore where Horae, goddess of the seasons, is awaiting her with a cloak. She is pictured naked to show her innocence and divinity. Category:Sandro Botticelli Category:15th-century paintings
