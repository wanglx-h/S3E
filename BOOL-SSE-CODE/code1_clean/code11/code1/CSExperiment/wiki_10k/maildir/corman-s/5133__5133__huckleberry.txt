Image:Huckleberry.jpg '''Huckleberry''' is a name used in North America for several plants in two closely related Genus in the Family (biology) ''Ericaceae'': ''Gaylussacia'' and ''Vaccinium''. The huckleberry is the U.S. state fruit of Idaho. Some ''Vaccinium'' species, such as the red huckleberry, are always called huckleberries. Other species may be called Blueberry or huckleberries in different locations. There is much confusion in naming of berry in American English. The 'garden huckleberry' (''Solanum melanocerasum'') is not a true huckleberry but a member of the nightshade family. The fruit of most species of huckleberry can be eaten. The berries are small and round. They are usually less than 5mm in diameter and contain 10 seeds. Berries range in color from bright red, through dark purple, and into the blues. In taste the berries range from wikt:tart to Sweet (taste). They have a flavor similar to that of a blueberry. Huckleberries are well liked by many mammals such as bears and humans. ==References== Category:Berries Category:Ericaceae
