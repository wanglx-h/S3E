The Americans wanted to education the German people to became a democracy. So they wikt:encourage prisoners with talent to write. Böll and some other young writers founded the group 47. Böll wrote a lot of society critical literature. His main themes were the repression in the way of life by conservatism catholic forces and the unsolved problem of old Nazism in the society. In the 1970s, he criticized the losing of civil laws by the fight against terrorism (of the RAF, Red Army Faction, a left-winged politics terror group in the 1970s in West Germany). For that reason, the Bild-Zeitung, an very conservative yellow press newspaper, started a campaign against him.
