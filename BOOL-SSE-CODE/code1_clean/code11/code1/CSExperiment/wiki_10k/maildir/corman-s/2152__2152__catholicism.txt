File:Mapamundi católico (2005).png '''Catholicism''' is the traditions and beliefs of Catholic Churches. It refers to their theology, liturgy, morals and spirituality. The term usually refers to churches, both Latin Church and Eastern Catholic churches, that are in full communion with the Holy See. ==Overview== In 2012, there were more than 1.1 billion Catholics worldwide. This makes up more than 17% of the world population. ==Origin== The word "Catholicism" comes from the Greek language word ''catholikismos'' (). This means "universal". ===Meaning=== The word "Catholicism" refers to many things, including its religious beliefs (called Theology and "doctrines"), and its form of religious worship (called liturgy). The word also refers to Catholic religious beliefs about ethics (things that are right and wrong). It also refers to the ways that members of the Catholic religion live and practice their religion.For McBrien, the "broad term" refers exclusively and specifically to that "Communion of Catholic Churches" in communion with the Bishop of Rome. Richard McBrien, ''The Church: The Evolution of Catholicism'' (New York: HarperOne, 2008), 6, 281-82, and 356. In its [http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_28051992_communionis-notio_en.html Letter on Some Aspects of the Church Understood as Communion] the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith stressed that the idea of the universal church as a communion of churches must not be presented as meaning that "every particular Church is a subject complete in itself, and that the universal church is the result of a ''reciprocal recognition'' on the part of the particular Churches". It insisted that "the universal Church cannot be conceived as the sum of the particular Churches, or as a federation of particular Churches". ==Use== Many people use the word Catholicism to talk about religious beliefs of the Catholic Church, whose leader is called the "Bishop of Rome" and often called the "Pope". The Catholic Church is based in the Vatican City, a small independent country in the city of Rome, Italy.McBrien, Catholicism, 19-20. Sometimes the word also refers to beliefs of other Christian churches, including the Eastern Orthodox Churches, who have many beliefs similar to the Catholic Church, but do not believe the Bishop of Rome is their leader. The word Catholicism is often used to tell the difference between the beliefs of Catholic Christians and the beliefs of others called Protestant Christians. Catholic and Orthodox churches use church leaders, called bishops, to determine beliefs. Protestants, however, often use each member's own understanding of the Bible to determine beliefs. Protestants use guidelines from the 16th-century Protestant Reformation to understand the Bible.The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (Oxford University Press 2005 ), article ''Catholic'', p. 308 It is the world's second largest religious denomination after Sunnism.Religious Diversity and Children's Literature: Strategies and Resources, Sandra Brenneman Oldendorf - 2011, p 156 ==History== The oldest document that uses the name "Catholic Church" is a letter written by a man named Ignatius of Antioch. Ignatius lived in the ancient city of Antioch. In the year 107, Ignatius wrote a letter addressed to the Christian community in the ancient city of Smyrna. In this letter, Ignatius encouraged the Christian Community to be loyal to their leader, the Bishop. Ignatius wrote: Wherever the bishop shall appear, there let the multitude of the people also be; even as, wherever Jesus Christ is, there is the Catholic Church. ==Group identified as ''Catholic''== Many different Christian denomination (groups) of Christians call themselves "catholic". Often these groups have special beliefs about their leaders, called bishops. They believe Jesus of Nazareth (whom Christians believe is the Son of God) appointed the first bishops, who appointed future bishops, who eventually appointed each community's current bishops. This appointing of leaders is called "Apostolic Succession". The groups that use the term "Catholic" to talk about themselves are the: # Catholic Church, which is also called the Roman Catholic Church.Richard McBrien, ''Catholicism'' (Minneapolis, MN: Winston Press, 1981), 680. # Eastern Orthodox Church and Oriental Orthodoxy # Old Catholic Church, Anglican, and some Lutheran and other groups # Communities that believe they lost their "Apostolic Succession", but asked a different community to "ordain" new leaders for them. ("Ordain" or Consecration" is a word for the ceremony that makes a bishop or new religious leader.) Not all communities believe that other communities use the term "catholic" properly. Also, not all communities believe that the other communities have apostolic succession either. For example, the Catholic Church believes that the Eastern Orthodox have apostolic succession. However, the Catholic Church does not believe that the Anglicans or Lutherans have it. Eastern Orthodox have similar beliefs about Anglicans and Lutherans. Not all Eastern Orthodox believe that the Catholic Church has apostolic succession. Different members of the Eastern Orthodox churches have different opinions. However, the Anglicans and Lutherans generally believe that all Christians are part of the "catholic" church. These groups have a very different understanding of the term "Catholic". ===Classical antiquity=== Catholicism was started as a result of Jesus of Nazareth, a Jewish man whom Christians believe is the Son of God, a Christian belief known as the Trinity (Christian) (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit). Catholics believe Jesus to be a descendant of David, a Jewish king from a long time ago. Jesus was crucified by the Roman Empire in the year 33. Catholics believe Jesus rose from the dead, and spoke to his followers, called the twelve Apostles. They also believe that Jesus rose into Heaven, and then sent the Holy Spirit to guide his followers at an event known as Pentecost. One of his followers, the apostle named Saint Peter, was appointed leader by Jesus and later became recognized as the first Pope, or Bishop of Rome. Soon after that, he was captured and martyred in Rome. Catholics believe that Saint Peter was given the "keys of the Kingdom of Heaven," meaning that Jesus made him and the apostles in charge of forgiving sins. Catholics believe that Saint Peter passed the Apostolic Power (the ability to ordain priests and consecrate the Eucharist), given to him by Christ, to the Popes, who continue to pass the power through the papacy to this day. The pope is the leader of the Catholic Church. The word ''pope'' comes from the Latin word for "father." In 325, the First Council of Nicaea agreed on how to organize the church. The council agreed the Church had five patriarchs (patriarch was the highest type of church leader). The five leaders were the archbishops of Rome (the Pope), Alexandria, Antioch, Constantinople, and Jerusalem. The Patriarch of Rome was honored as "first among equals." ===Schisms=== In time, several groups split off from the Catholic Church because of differing opinions of theology. This caused breaks from the Church called schisms. Most schisms happened because people had different beliefs about what is true. ====Chalcedonian schism==== In 451, a church division happened when all the church leaders meeting at the Council of Chalcedon Excommunication (cut off) three leaders, because they held to monophysitism and would not accept the view that Jesus had two natures (fully divine and fully human). These three were the bishops of Egypt, Syria, and Armenia. Of course, these three bishops did not accept being excommunicated either, so the churches under them are still known today as Oriental Orthodox Churches. ====Great Schism==== In 1054, an Eastern part of the Catholic Church severed itself, in the East-West Schism. The church in Western Europe which followed the Pope, became known as the Roman Catholic Church. The churches in the rest of the world, which did not think that the Pope should lead all Christians, became known as the Eastern Orthodox Church. "Orthodox" means "correct belief;" as they believe that they have kept the teachings of the early church, and the Roman Catholics have not. ====Reformation==== The next big secession was the Protestant Reformation. Protestants resisted the valid central authority of the Church in Rome and rejected many practices, beliefs and disciplines. The Reformation started in Germany, where Martin Luther sent his demands for change to the Church. Because of politics in Europe, many nations supported Luther. The Lutheranism was started. Later the Calvinist or Presbyterian Church started. In England, King Henry VIII of England started the Anglicanism church. He wanted to divorce his Catherine of Aragon; but the Pope wouldn't allow it, as the marriage was valid. At first, the church of King Henry VIII, the Church of England, was very similar to the Catholic Church. The major difference was that the king was head of the church, instead of the Pope. Later, under his son, Edward VI of England, the Anglican Church became more Reformed churches or Protestant. Anglicans, and several other Protestant denominations, still believe they are reformed Catholics. Puritanism arose among Anglicans who thought the reforms didn't go far enough. After the Reformation, many other Churches began because of disagreements over beliefs and practices of earlier Protestant doctrine. According to the 2010 U.S. Religious Congregations and Membership Study, this accounts for most of the Protestant denominations in the United States. There are about 314,000 of these. Two examples of these Protestant (or Reformed) churches are Methodism and Baptist. ==Doctrines== * The Ten Commandments * The importance of worshipping God * The infallibility of the Bible * The supremacy of the Pope * The belief that God knows everything, that God has unlimited power, and that everything God does is good * The belief that Jesus Christ died for the sins of the world, rose again, and one day "will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead" ===Differences from Eastern Orthodoxy=== * the Filioque clause (Nicene creed) ===Differences from mainstream Protestants=== * Catholics have an elaborate Mary (mother of Jesus), while most Protestants do not * Catholics believe in the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, also called Transubstantiation * Catholics hold to a larger 73 book Books of the Bible, while Protestants typically hold to 66 books * Catholics believe God forgives mortal sins through the sacrament of Absolution (confession), performed through a priest, while most Protestants do not believe in the sacrament * Catholics hold to the authority of Scripture and Tradition, which the teaching authority of the Church Magisterium (the bishops in communion with the Pope) comes from, while most Protestants believe in ''Sola scriptura'' (the Bible alone) * Catholics believe that papal authority (in very specific, solemn occasions called "ex Cathedra"), the Bible and conclusions of ecumenical councils are infallible, while most Protestants believe in an Biblical inerrancy but not an infallible Pope. Papal infallibility has been declared twice in the history of the Catholic Church. Once to state that Mary was conceived without sin and another to state that Mary was assumed into heaven body and soul * Catholics venerate saints, especially the Virgin Mary (Mother of God). "Venerating saints" means that Catholics give special honor to saints (people in heaven) because they believe that saints can pray for them directly to God. Many Protestants do not, because they regard "venerating saints" as "worshiping saints". Because they believe that only God should be worshiped, they do not venerate. Many Protestants also simply do not believe that any veneration is necessary ==Related pages== * Ustaše * Inquisition ** Spanish Inquisition * Anglicanism * Antisemitism#Lies about Jews * Protestantism ** Five solas *** Sola fide *** Sola gratia *** Sola scriptura *** Solus Christus *** Soli Deo Gloria * Supersessionism * East-West Schism * Eastern Christianity * Independent State of Croatia * ''The Protocols of the Elders of Zion'' * Native Americans in the United States#European Exploration and Colonization ==Other websites== * [https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/the-catholic-church The Catholic Church] * [https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/antisemitism-in-history-from-the-early-church-to-1400 Antisemitism in History: From the Early Church to 1400] * [https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/scottish-journal-of-theology/article/abs/our-lady-reconsidered-john-knox-and-the-virgin-mary/D261C972F361CB7E24AE956D120F6F60 Our Lady reconsidered: John Knox and the Virgin Mary] * [https://jpost.com/blogs/the-jewish-problem---from-anti-judaism-to-anti-semitism/foundations-of-holocaust-from-inquisition-to-purity-of-blood-365346 Foundations of Holocaust: From Inquisition to “Purity of Blood”] ==References== Category:Catholicism
