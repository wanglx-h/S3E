It is an ice giant. It is the fourth-largest planet in the system. Neptune's mass is 17 times Earth's mass and a little bit more than Uranus' mass. Neptune is denser and smaller than Uranus. Because of its greater mass, Neptune's gravity makes its atmosphere smaller and density. It was named after the Roman mythology of the sea, Neptune (mythology). Neptune's astronomical symbol is ♆, the trident of the god Neptune. Neptune's atmosphere is mostly hydrogen and helium. It also contains small amounts of methane which makes the planet appear blue. Neptune's blue color is similar, but slightly darker, than the color of Uranus (planet). Neptune also has the strongest winds of any planet in the Solar System, as high as 2,100Kilometres per hour or 1,300Miles per hour. Urbain Le Verrier and John Couch Adams were the astronomers who discovered Neptune. Neptune was not discovered using a telescope. It was the first planet to be discovered using mathematics. In 1821, astronomers saw that Uranus' orbit was different from what they expected. Another nearby planet's mass was changing Uranus' orbit. They found Neptune was the cause. ''Voyager 2'' visited Neptune on 25 August 1989. It was the only spacecraft to visit the planet. Neptune used to have a huge storm known as the "Great Dark Spot". ''Voyager 2'' discovered the spot in 1989. The dark spot was not seen in 1994, but new spots were found since then. It is not known why the dark spot disappeared. Visits by other space probes have been planned. Neptune has five rings surrounding it. However, the rings are hard to see from Earth. == History == File:Galileo.arp.300pix.jpg|left]] File:Urbain Le Verrier.jpg, the co-discoverer of Neptune|left]] === Discovery === Galileo Galilei was the first person to see Neptune. He saw it on 28 December 1612 and 27 January 1613. His drawings showed the points where Neptune is placed, it is near Jupiter. But Galileo was not credited for the discovery. He thought Neptune was a "fixed star" instead of a planet. Because Neptune moved slowly across the sky, Galileo's small telescope was not strong enough to see that Neptune was a planet. In 1821, Alexis Bouvard published the astronomical tables of the orbit of Uranus.A. Bouvard (1821), ''[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1821tapp.book.....B&db_key=AST&data_type=HTML&format=&high=44b52c369020669 Tables astronomiques publiées par le Bureau des Longitudes de France].'' Paris: Bachelier Later observations showed that Uranus was orbiting in an irregular way.[Anon.] (2001) "Bouvard, Alexis", ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', Deluxe CDROM edition Some astronomers thought this was caused by another large planet. In 1843, John Couch Adams calculated the orbit of an eighth planet that could possibly affect the orbit of Uranus. He sent his calculations to Sir George Airy, the Astronomer Royal. George Airy asked Adams for an explanation. In 1846, Urbain Le Verrier made his own calculations but also failed to get much attention from French astronomers. Airy saw his calculations and encouraged James Challis to search for the planet. Challis began his search in July 1846. Meanwhile, Le Verrier had convinced Johann Gottfried Galle to search for the planet. Heinrich d'Arrest, a student at the Berlin Observatory, suggested that a newly drawn map of the sky in the region of Le Verrier's predicted area could be compared with the current sky. This map was needed to look for the change of position of a planet, compared to a fixed star. Neptune was discovered the same night on 23 September 1846. It was found 1° from where Le Verrier had thought it would be. It was about 1.5° from Adams' prediction. Challis later found out that he had seen the planet twice in August. He did not recognize it at the time because of his careless work approach. Neptune became the first planet to be discovered by mathematical calculations instead of a telescope.File:Neptune Orbit.gif === Crediting and naming === When Neptune was discovered, the French and the British could not agree on who would get credit for the discovery. Later, an international agreement decided that both Le Verrier and Adams deserved credit. However, historians reviewed the topic after the rediscovery in 1998 of the "Neptune papers" (historical documents from the Royal Greenwich Observatory). It had seemingly been stolen by astronomer Olin Eggen for almost 30 years. It was only found again (in his ownership) shortly after his death. After looking at the documents, some historians now think that Adams does not deserve equal credit with Le Verrier.William Sheehan, Nicholas Kollerstrom, Craig B. Waff (December 2004). [http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=000CA850-8EA4-119B-8EA483414B7FFE9F The Case of the Pilfered Planet - Did the British steal Neptune?] ''Scientific American''. Shortly after its discovery, Neptune was temporarily called "the planet exterior to Uranus" or "Le Verrier's planet". The first suggestion for a name came from Galle. He proposed the name ''Janus''. In England, Challis suggested the name ''Oceanus''. In France, François Jean Dominique Arago suggested that the new planet be called ''Leverrier'', but a lot of people outside France disagreed with this. French almanacs quickly reintroduced the name ''Herschel'' for Uranus and ''Leverrier'' for Neptune. Meanwhile, Adams suggested changing the name ''Georgian'' to ''Uranus'', while Le Verrier (through the Board of Longitude) suggested ''Neptune'' for the new planet. Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve supported the name ''Neptune'' on 29 December 1846, to the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Smithsonian/NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS). Soon, ''Neptune'' was internationally agreed as the official name for the new planet. In Roman mythology, Neptune (god) was the god of the sea, identified with the Greek god, Poseidon. Neptune's astrological symbol is Neptune's trident (♆). == Structure == === Mass and composition === Neptune's mass is between that of the Earth and the largest gas giants.At 102.413kilogram, Neptune is the fourth largest planet in the Solar System and the third most massive. Neptune is 17 times the mass of Earth, but just the mass of Jupiter.Bradford A. Smith, «Neptune », 'World Book Online Reference Center', 2004, p. 5 Neptune is a little bit more massive than Uranus, though Neptune is denser and smaller in size than Uranus. Neptune and Uranus are often considered a part of "ice giants" (a sub-class of gas giants). They are smaller in size than Jupiter and Saturn, and have different compositions. To search extrasolar planets, Neptune has been used as a reference to compare the size and structure of other discovered planets. Some discovered planets that have similar masses like Neptune are often called "Neptunes". The atmosphere of Neptune is made up mostly of hydrogen, with a smaller amount of helium. A tiny amount of methane was also detected in the atmosphere. The methane gives Neptune its blue color. NASA Space Place – NASA Science for Kids|url=https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/all-about-neptune/en/|access-date=2021-06-12|website=spaceplace.nasa.gov}} The color of Neptune is similar, but slightly darker, than the color of Uranus. Because of Neptune's far distance from the Sun, it gets very little heat. The average surface temperature on Neptune is about −201°Celsius (−331 °Fahrenheit; 72 Kelvin). Therefore, at its surface Neptune is the coldest planet in the Solar System. But in the depths of the planet, the temperature rises. The source of this heating is unclear.Broadfoot A.L.; Atreya S.K.; Bertaux J.L.; et al. 1999. Ultraviolet Spectrometer Observations of Neptune and Triton. ''Science''. '''246''' (4936): 1459–66.

Several possible explanations have been suggested. Firstly, radiogenic heating from the planet's core. Among the explanations is the continued radiation into space of leftover heat made by Accretion theory during the planet's birth. Another explanation is gravity waves breaking above the tropopause. It has also been suggested that the friction and ram pressure of the diamond hail heats up the planet.McHugh J.P. [http://www.aas.org/publications/baas/v31n4/dps99/572.htm Computation of gravity waves near the tropopause] , ''AAS/Division for Planetary Sciences Meeting Abstracts'', p. 53.07, September 1999McHugh J.P. and Friedson A.J. 1996. Neptune's energy crisis: gravity wave heating of the stratosphere of Neptune. ''Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society'', p1078. The structure inside Neptune is thought to be similar to the structure inside Uranus.Hubbard, W.B. 1997. Neptune's deep chemistry. ''Science''. '''275''' (5304): 1279–80. There is likely to be a planetary core, thought to be about 1.5 Earth masses. It is made up of molten rock and metal surrounded by rock, water, ammonia, and methane. This mixture is referred to as icy. It is called a water-ammonia ocean.Atreya, S.; Egeler, P.; Baines, K. 2006. [https://www.cosis.net/abstracts/EGU06/05179/EGU06-J-05179-1.pdf Water-ammonia ionic ocean on Uranus and Neptune?] (PDF). ''Geophysical Research Abstracts''. '''8''', 05179. More mixtures of methane, ammonia, and water are found in the lower areas of the atmosphere.'''''' At a depth of 7,000km of Neptune, the methane may decomposes into diamond crystals. These diamond crystals look like hailstones.Kerr, Richard A. 1999. Neptune may crush methane into diamonds. ''Science''. '''286''' (5437): 25a–25. === Weather and magnetic field === One difference between Neptune and Uranus is the level of its Meteorology activity. When the Voyager spacecraft flew by Uranus in 1986, the winds on that planet were observed not so strong as on Neptune. When Voyager flew by Neptune in 1989, powerful weather events were observed. The weather of Neptune has very active storms. Its atmosphere has the highest wind speeds in the Solar System. It may be powered by internal heat flow. Regular winds in the equatorial region have speeds of around 1,200km/h (750mph). Winds in storm systems can reach up to 2,100km/h, near-supersonic speeds. In 1989, the Great Dark Spot, an anticyclonic storm system, was discovered by NASA's ''Voyager 2'' spacecraft. On 2 November 1994, the Hubble Space Telescope did not see the Great Dark Spot on the planet. Instead, a new storm similar to the Great Dark Spot was found in the planet's Northern Hemisphere. The reason why the Great Dark Spot has disappeared is unknown.Sromovsky L.A.; Fry P.M.; Dowling T.E. & Baines K.H. 2000. The unusual dynamics of new dark spots on Neptune. ''Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society''. '''32''': 1005 The Scooter is another storm, a white cloud group farther south than the Great Dark Spot. Its nickname was given when first noticed in the months leading up to the ''Voyager'' encounter in 1989. It moved faster than the Great Dark Spot. Introduction to Astronomy|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/atd-fscj-introastronomy/chapter/planet-neptune/#:~:text=Neptune%20also%20has%20atmospheric%20scooters,of%201,200%20miles%20per%20hour.|access-date=2021-06-15|website=courses.lumenlearning.com}} Later images showed clouds that moved even faster than Scooter. The Small Dark Spot is another southern cyclonic storm, the second strongest storm seen during the 1989 encounter. It originally was completely dark, but as ''Voyager'' came closer to the planet, a bright core developed. File:Neptune Cloud Cover Over Three Decades (2023-019).png In August 2023, the clouds vanished. The possible reason is solar flare. 30 years of Neptune' weather observations by Hubble Space Telescope showed that cloud activity is related to solar cycles. Neptune also has similarities with Uranus in its magnetosphere. However, Uranus' magnetosphere is weaker than Neptune's magnetosphere. The magnetic field is strongly tilted compared to its rotational axis at 47°. It is offset at least 0.55radii (about 13,500kilometres, bigger than the Earth's diameter, for scale) from the planet's physical center. The unusual course may be caused by flows in the interior of the planet. Neptune has a similar axial tilt to Earth, so it will have seasons. Its seasons last about 40 years. == Neptune's rings == File:New Webb Image Captures Clearest View of Neptune’s Rings in Decades.png]] There are five rings around the planet. They are not as well known as the rings of Saturn. The rings were discovered by a team led by an American scientist Edward Guinan in 1968. Then, in the mid-1980s astronomers thought that the rings might not be complete. Stellar occultations were found that rarely showed an extra "blink" just before or after the planet Occultation the star. However, ''Voyager 2'' showed that they were complete. The planetary rings of Neptune have a weird "clumpy" arrangement. Scientists think that it may be because of the gravitational contact with small moons that orbit near them. Pictures showed that the ring system had several faint rings. The farthest ring, Adams, has five arcs named ''Courage'', ''Liberté'', ''Egalité 1'', ''Egalité 2'', and ''Fraternité'' (Courage, Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity). File:Neptune rings PIA02224.jpg The laws of motion predict that arcs will spread out into one ring in a very short time. But the arcs in Neptune's rings somehow did not. A moon's gravity may have created the arcs. Galatea (moon) is a moon just inside the Adams ring. Neptune|url=https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/neptune/in-depth|access-date=10 May 2021|website=NASA Solar System Exploration}} However, in 2005, scientists figured out that Neptune's rings were more unstable than previously believed. The ''Liberté'' arc may disappear in roughly less than 100 years. == Neptune's moons == Neptune has 16 known Natural satellite. As Neptune was the Roman god of the sea, the planet's moons were named after lesser sea gods or goddesses.[https://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Page/Planets "Planet and Satellite Names and Discoverers"]. Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature. U.S. Geological Survey. The largest moon of Neptune is Triton (moon). Triton was discovered on 10 October 1846 by British astronomer William Lassell. Triton|url=https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/neptune-moons/triton/in-depth|access-date=2021-06-13|website=NASA Solar System Exploration|archive-date=2018-08-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817014136/https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/neptune-moons/triton/in-depth|url-status=dead}} Unlike all other large planetary moons, Triton Retrograde orbit to the other moons. This shows the moon was probably captured.Agnor, Craig B.; Hamilton, Douglas P. 2006. Neptune's capture of its moon Triton in a binary–planet gravitational encounter. ''Nature'' '''441''' (7090): 192–194. It is close enough to Neptune to be locked into a synchronous orbit. It is also slowly moving into Neptune and may one day be torn apart when it passes the Roche limit. Triton is the coldest object that has been measured in the Solar System, with temperatures of −235°C (38 K, −392°F).Nelson R.M; Smythe W.D; Wallis B.D; Horn L.J; et al 1990. Temperature and thermal emissivity of the surface of Neptune's satellite Triton. ''Science''. '''250''' (4979): 429–31. Neptune's second known moon (by order of discovery), the odd moon Nereid (moon), has one of the most unusual orbits of any satellite in the Solar System. Nereid|url=https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/neptune-moons/nereid/in-depth|access-date=2021-06-11|website=NASA Solar System Exploration|archive-date=2021-06-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210611214602/https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/neptune-moons/nereid/in-depth/|url-status=dead}} Nereid is so far from Neptune that it requires 360 Earth days to make one orbit. It causes the largest elliptical orbit and the largest deviation from a Circular orbit. Some of these moons have been speculated to have been possible Kuiper belt objects, which in turn became a part of Neptune's orbit. From July to September 1989, ''Voyager 2'' discovered six new moons of Neptune.Stone, E.C.; Miner, E.D. (1989). "The Voyager 2 Encounter with the Neptunian System". ''Science''. 246 (4936): 1417–21. Of these, Proteus (moon) is the second most massive Neptunian moon. Rwanda|language=en}} It has only one quarter of 1% of the mass of Triton. Neptune's closest four moons, Naiad (moon), Thalassa (moon), Despina (moon), and Galatea (moon), orbit close enough to be inside Neptune's rings. The next farthest out, Larissa (moon) was discovered in 1981 when it had covered up light from a star. Larissa|url=https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/neptune-moons/larissa/in-depth|access-date=2021-06-15|website=NASA Solar System Exploration|archive-date=2021-06-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210627110206/https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/neptune-moons/larissa/in-depth/|url-status=dead}} The moon was credited for causing Neptune's ring arcs when ''Voyager 2'' observed Neptune in 1989. Five new unusual moons discovered between 2002 and 2003 were announced in 2004. The latest moon, S/2004 N 1, was discovered from examining Hubble Telescope images on 16 July 2013.

Triton (moon) is clearly visible, while others appear much smaller.]] == Observation == Neptune cannot be seen by just looking at the sky with the naked eye. To see it, a telescope or binoculars is needed. This is because Neptune has a normal brightness between Apparent magnitude +7.7 and +8.0. It can be outshined by Jupiter (planet)'s Galilean moons, the dwarf planet Ceres (dwarf planet), and the asteroids 4 Vesta, 2 Pallas, 7 Iris, 3 Juno and 6 Hebe.See the respective articles for magnitude data. A telescope or strong binoculars show Neptune as a small blue dot that looks similar to Uranus. The blue color comes from the methane in its atmosphere. Its small size in the night sky has made it difficult to study visually. Most telescopic data was quite limited until the arrival of the Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics. The average distance between Neptune and the Sun is about 4.5 billion km. Therefore, Neptune completes its orbit once every 164years. On 12 July 2011, Neptune completed its first orbit since its discovery in 1846. == Exploration == File:Voyager.jpg'']] Currently, only one spacecraft has visited Neptune. NASA's ''Voyager 2'' probe made a quick fly-by of the planet with its closest encounter on 25 August 1989. Neptune|url=https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/neptune/exploration?page=0&per_page=10&order=launch_date+desc,title+asc&search=&tags=Neptune&category=33|access-date=15 May 2021|website=NASA Solar System Exploration}} One of ''Voyager 2'''s important discoveries was its very close fly-by of Triton (moon), where it took pictures of several parts of the moon. The pictures were sent back to Earth from ''Voyager 2'' in 1989. The probe also discovered the Great Dark Spot. However, it had now disappeared after the Hubble Space Telescope took pictures of Neptune in 1994. Originally thought to be a large cloud or cyclonic storm system. It was later guessed to be a hole in the visible cloud deck."[https://www.windows2universe.org/neptune/atmosphere/N_clouds_GDS.html Neptune's Great Dark Spot of 1989]" Windows to the Universe === Proposed missions === * Shensuo (used to be called Interstellar Express)—Two probes by China National Space Administration to explore the heliosphere.
