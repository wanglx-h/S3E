They are in a subfamily of the Salamandridae. They are found in North America, Europe, and North Asia. == Life cycle == Females lay Egg (biology) and leave them. Tadpoles are Birth from those eggs. Newts have three life stages. First as a tiny aquatic larva, which gradually undergoes metamorphosis. Then they leave the water for a year as a juvenile called an ''eft''. They go back in the water to breed as adults. In some species the adults stay in water for the rest of their lives. Others are land-based, but return to water each year to breed. == Defences == Many newts produce toxins in their skin secretions as a defence against predators. They have wikt:bright skin colours as a warning to other animals. ''Taricha'' newts of western North America are particularly toxic; the rough-skinned newt ''Taricha granulosa'' of the Pacific Northwest produces more than enough tetrodotoxin to kill an adult human. Recently, a 29-year-old man in Coos Bay, Oregon, who had been drinking heavily, swallowed a rough-skin newt for a dare; he died later that day despite hospital treatment. Most newts can be safely handled, provided that the toxins they produce are not ingested or allowed to come in contact with mucous membranes, or breaks in the skin.see [http://www.caudata.org/cc/articles/toxin2.shtml caudata.org] Accessed 2007-11-28 After handling, proper hand-washing techniques should be followed due to the risk from the toxins they produce and bacteria they carry, such as salmonella.[https://web.archive.org/web/20040618015311/http://www.metrokc.gov/health/prevcont/salmonellosis-reptiles.htm Salmonellosis - Reptiles and Amphibians] Accessed 2007-11-28[https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5249a3.htm CDC MMWR: Reptile-Associated Salmonellosis: Selected States, 1998-2002] Accessed 2007-11-28 It is illegal to handle or disturb great crested newts in the UK without a licence.[http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/wildfacts/factfiles/479.shtml bbc.co.uk Factfile 479] Accessed 2007-11-28 == Are newts a related group? == The term "newt" has traditionally been used as a functional term for salamanders living in water, and not a Biological classification. The relationship between the Genus has been uncertain, though they may be a clade. Newer molecular analysis tend to suggest they actually do form a clade.Titus T.A. & A. Larson 1995.
