File:Xuan Huong Lake 08.jpg '''Dalat''' (Vietnamese language: Đà Lạt) is a city in southern Vietnam. It was built in the early 1900s to be a resort city for the French. Much of the buildings are European style. This is why it has the nickname "Little Paris". The city is known for its much cooler climate than most of the rest of Vietnam. It is known for having high altitude, many pine trees, and being an excellent place to grow many different kinds of fruits, vegetables, and flowers. It has about 120,000 inhabitants. ==References== Category:Cities in Vietnam
