Subject: Family name
A '''family name''' is a name shared by people in the same family. Different cultures have different customs for a person's family name and given name. In English, the family name is always at the end, and it is called a '''last name''' or '''surname'''. Children usually have the same family name as their father. A married woman usually changes her family name to be the same as her husband. File:FML names-2.png as example. This shows a structure typical for English-speaking cultures (and some others). Other cultures use other structures for full names.]] For example, Mary Brown married John Smith and she changed her name to Mary Smith. They had two children, David Smith and Kate Smith.
