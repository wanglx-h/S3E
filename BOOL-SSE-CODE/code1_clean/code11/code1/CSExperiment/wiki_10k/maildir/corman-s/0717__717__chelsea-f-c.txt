Their home stadium is Stamford Bridge (stadium) in Fulham, London. Chelsea is wikt:Consider to be one of the most successful clubs in England, having won many trophies, including 6 Premier League, 2 UEFA Champions League, 2 UEFA Europa League, 5 EFL Cup, 8 FA Cup, 1 UEFA Super Cup and 2 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup titles. Their all-time highest goalscorer is Frank Lampard and their most successful goalkeeper (on the basis of clean sheets and titles statistics) is Petr Čech. Chelsea is owned by the United Statesn businessmans Todd Boehly, Mark Walter and Swiss businessman Hansjörg Wyss. There was a supposed breakaway European Super League that Chelsea were apart of but this quickly collapsed as many English teams pulled out due to fan disagreement. Chelsea were the first of the English teams to pull out after Chelsea fans protested outside of the stadium before their game against Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.. == History == Chelsea started in 1905 and played the second division of the league. They won their first trophy in 1955, when they became Champions of the First Division. They won the FA Cup in 1970, 1997, 2000 and 2007. They won the EFL Cup in 1965, 1998, 2005 and 2007. In 1970s Chelsea failed to maintain their position of the first division, due to the financial difficulties. In 1990s they challenged the title of Premier League. They came close but did not win it until 2005 and 2006. In 2003 the Russian billionaire, Roman Abramovich, purchased Chelsea and invested lots of capital to employ new football players. He also hired Luiz Felipe Scolari as the manager of the club. Abramovich also employed Peter Kenyon as the chief executive to be responsible for the commercial strategies of the club. This made Chelsea stronger, and they won the English Premier League in consecutive years. A third straight FA Premier League title slipped through Chelsea's fingertips after their failure to defeat Arsenal F.C. at the Emirates Stadium, meaning that Manchester United F.C. had won their ninth league title in fifteen tries. On September 20, 2007, the very successful manager José Mourinho left the club by "mutual consent". This exit came just days after a shockingly poor performance which saw them barely scrape out a 1-1 draw in a UEFA Champions League tie against Norwegian side Rosenborg B.K.. Following Mourinho's exit, Chelsea made Director of Football Avram Grant, the former manager of Israel from 2002 to 2006, the new manager of the club, until May 2008. Grant took over with Chelsea trailing in the English Premier League "title race" behind Manchester United and Arsenal, and managed to keep Chelsea in the hunt for the league until the last game of the season. He got Chelsea into the UEFA Champions League for the first time as well as the Carling Cup Final, but he was sacked at the end of the season, along with assistant Henk ten Cate. Grant was sacked from the job after he lost in the final in a 5-6 penalty shootout loss to Manchester United and replaced by Luiz Felipe Scolari, the then-Portugal coach, in August. However, after a poor run of results Scolari was sacked on February 9, 2009. Guus Hiddink took over the club until the rest of the season. In early June they played in the FA Cup final against Everton F.C., where Chelsea won 2-1, after Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba scored goals. In that final, Louis Saha of Everton scored the fastest goal in FA Cup history, in 25seconds. A week later, the former A.C. Milan manager Carlo Ancelotti was named as the new manager of Chelsea. Antonio Conte was their manager until July 2018 and helped them win the 2016/17 league title. Frank Lampard, former Chelsea player, became Chelsea F.C.'s successor manager. He was sacked in mid-season of 2020/21 following series of poor performances. Thomas Tuchel replaced him, and successfully took Chelsea to the finals of UEFA Champions League 2020/21, played against Manchester City F.C., held in Istanbul, Turkey. Chelsea won the final 1-0, with the winning goal scored by Kai Havertz. On May 7 2022, Roman Abramovich sold the club to consortium led by Todd Boehly, Clearlake Capital, Mark Walter and Hansjörg Wyss. == League position == {| class="wikitable" style="text-align:left;" |- style="text-align:center;" ||Season|| style="text-align:center;"|League|| style="text-align:center;"|Position |- |2000–01||English Premier League||6th |- |2001–02||English Premier League||6th |- |2002–03||English Premier League||4th |- |2003–04||English Premier League||2nd |- |2004–05||English Premier League||Champions |- |2005–06||English Premier League||Champions |- |2006–07||English Premier League||2nd |- |2007–08||English Premier League||2nd |- |2008–09||English Premier League||3rd |- |2009–10||English Premier League||Champions |- |2010–11||English Premier League||2nd |- |2011–12||English Premier League||6th |- |2012–13||English Premier League||3rd |- |2013–14||English Premier League||3rd |- |2014–15||English Premier League||Champions |- |2015–16||English Premier League||10th |- |2016–17||English Premier League||Champions |- |2017–18||English Premier League||5th |- |2018–19||English Premier League||3rd |- |2019–20 |Premier League |4th |- |2020–21 |Premier League |4th |- |2021–22 |Premier League |3rd |- |2022–23 |Premier League |12th |} === Former position === ==Players== ===First-team squad=== ====Out on loan==== ===Other players under contract=== ===Development Squad and Academy=== * Players to have at least one first-team appearance for Chelsea. == Notable players == * Frank Lampard * John Terry * Didier Drogba * Petr Čech * Michael Ballack * Michael Essien * Andriy Shevchenko * Joe Cole * Florent Malouda * Ashley Cole * Eden Hazard * Peter Bonetti * Wayne Bridge * Claude Makélélé * William Gallas * Jimmy Greaves * Peter Osgood * Dennis Wise * Ruud Gullit * Mark Hughes * Gianfranco Zola * Celestine Babayaro * Tore André Flo * Marcel Desailly * Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink * Damien Duff * Shaun Wright-Phillips == References == Category:1905 establishments in England Category:Premier League clubs Category:Football clubs in London Category:Chelsea, London Category:London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham
