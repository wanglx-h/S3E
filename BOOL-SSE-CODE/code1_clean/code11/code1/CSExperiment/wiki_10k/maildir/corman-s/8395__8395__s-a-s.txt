It was founded in 1941 to attack behind the Germany line of defence in North Africa, in World War II. They are one of the best schooled units in the world, that makes them very valuable. There are about 500 active SAS soldiers.Ryan, Chris 2009. ''Fight to Win''. Century. ISBN 978-1-84605-666-6 The SAS is a secret organisation. Its members often do not tell anyone except close family that they are in it. The British Ministry of Defence (MOD) rarely speaks of the SAS and mission details are never released until much later. The badge of the organisation was originally designed as a flaming sword of Damocles but ended up as a winged dagger. It shows the motto: ''Who Dares Wins''. Current SAS roles include: * Gathering intelligence behind enemy lines. * Destroying targets far behind enemy lines. * Protecting The Royal Family, and important government members. * Training special forces of other nations. * Performing counter-terrorism operations. The SAS is thought of all over the world as one of the best, if not the best Special Operations organisations. This is mainly because of the intense training they are put through. The hardest part of this is intense interrogation (questioning while under torture) which the trainees must go through. The SAS is respected worldwide and used to train many other Special Forces Units. Several special operations units are modeled after the SAS. For example, the U.S. Army's Delta Force was founded due in large part to Charles Beckwith, a U.S. Army special operations officer, serving as an exchange officer with the SAS. He felt the U.S. Army was vulnerable in not having a unit comparable to the SAS. One fact is that the SAS are not often talked about, therefore the other countries tend to mention that they are never really talked about. At the same time they get announced as one of the best because they are so secret that the last mission heard about was performed in Iraq, which states how secretive they are. ==Related pages== * Central Intelligence Agency * Secret Intelligence Service * Special forces == Sources == Category:1941 establishments in Europe Category:Military of the United Kingdom Category:Special Forces Category:1940s establishments in the United Kingdom
