The countries shown in red are some examples of "banana republics" (Cuba, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama) where the United Fruit Company held considerable influence.]] A ''banana republic'' is a politically unstable country whose economy depends on the export of one product in limited supply, such as agricultural products like bananas or minerals. A banana republic has Class (social) that are divided by wealth. These include a large, poor working class and a small ruling class (elite) made up of the businessman, politicians, and the military. The ruling class controls and exploits the country's economy. '''Characteristics of a Banana Republic''' The way the phrase banana republic is used has evolved since it was introduced more than a century ago. It is no longer limited to countries in Central America or the tropics. Key characteristics of a banana republic in the modern world include: * Widespread government corruption * Dictatorship government * Unstable government * Civil unrest * Coup attempts/insurgency * Economic dependency on exporting a limited natural resource (which may or may not be bananas) * Infrastructure owned/supported by out-of-country interests * Overall economic dependency on foreign investment or business entities * Widespread poverty * Significant stratification of social classes * Enormous gap between the haves and have nots * Lack of a middle class '''Examples of Banana Republics''' In the modern world, whether or not a country could accurately be described as a banana republic government is a matter of opinion. A number of countries have been described as banana republics at some point. ● The United States * Bangladesh * Botswana * Costa Rica * Colombia * Cuba * Guatemala * Honduras * Nicaragua * Nigeria * Panama * Zambia A country that at some point might exhibit all of the characteristics of a banana republic could change, which would mean that the term would no longer apply. The fact that someone refers to a country as a banana republic does not mean that the country really is one. The phrase is a derogatory description rather than an actual type of government. ==Related pages== * Puppet state ==References== Category:Country classifications
