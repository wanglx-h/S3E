It was formed in Lebanon in 1982, during the Lebanese Civil War. The leader of Hezbollah is Naim Qassem. Hezbollah's main goals during the Lebanese Civil War were to fight against Western civilization influences and protect Lebanon's Shia Muslim population. Its members are mostly Shia Islam. The group also supports Arab people nationalism. It wants freedom for the Palestinian people in Palestine (region). Because of this, it believes that the State of Israel should not exist, and fights against it. Over the years, the Hezbollah militia has fought a guerrilla warfare against the Israel Defense Forces along the border in southern Lebanon. It often attacks Israeli military and civilian positions by firing Missile across Israel's northern border. Hezbollah is supported by Syria, Iran, Russia, Lebanon, Houthis and Hamas. == History == === Founding === Hezbollah was officially founded in 1985, following the 1982 Lebanon War. Lebanese Shia clerics who had received education in Najaf came together to form Hezbollah as a movement of Resistance movement against Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982. They were influenced by Ayatollah Khomeini's model established after the Iranian Revolution in 1979. The party's founders adopted "Hezbollah" as the name chosen by Khomeini which means 'Party of God'. Hezbollah is also part of the movement spreading the Islamic Revolution beyond Iran.

In 2000, Israel withdrew its troops from the "security zone" in Southern Lebanon, but not from a sliver of land called Shebba Farms. This fertile area was kept under Israeli Occupied territory. The border stayed relatively quiet until July 2006, except for targeted assassinations and kidnappings by Israel. In July 2006, Hezbollah killed three Israeli soldiers and captured an additional two. This led to the 2006 Lebanon War. Several foreign governments consider Hezbollah a Terrorism group.The global majority including Russia and China do not. Among those who consider it to be a terrorist group are the United States, "Current List of Designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations... 14. Hizballah (Party of God)". Bahrain, Canada, Japan, Netherlands and Israel. The European Union and the United Kingdom consider Hezbollah's military branch to be a terrorist group, but not the political party. Iran and Lebanon considers Hezbollah to be a legitimate Rebellion movement. This view is shared by Syria, Iran and all other countries in the Arab world.Russia considers Hezbollah as a legitimate sociopolitical organization while China remains neutral, and maintains contacts with Hezbollah. Other countries that do not consider Hezbollah a terror organization includes Cuba, Iraq, North Korea, and others. Hezbollah has received armed and logistics support from the government of Iran and its leader Naim Qassem maintains close ties with the Iranian supreme leader Ali Khamenei. Hezbollah forces in Syria were also commanded by the now deceased Iranian general Qasem Soleimani. Hezbollah participated in the Syrian civil war, fighting alongside Syrian government forces of the former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
