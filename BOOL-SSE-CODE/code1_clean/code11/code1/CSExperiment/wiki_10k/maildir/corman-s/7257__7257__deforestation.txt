File:Lacanja burn.JPG '''Deforestation''' is when forests are destroyed by cutting trees (logging) or burning them purposefully, without replanting more. The most common reason is to clear the land to make space for farms and ranches. They also cut trees for firewood and lumber and replace them with cities. Deforestation destroys the habitat of many animals, leading to their death. The loss is more severe in primary or old-growth forests, which are forests that have yet been untouched by humans. Deforestation also releases Carbon sequestration. Restoring trees in deforested places is called reforesting. == Causes of deforestation == File:5 مكامير الفحم.jpg Land has other uses besides Forestry. Ffarming and ranching are the two main motives that contribute to deforestation. Some land is also used for roads and buildings, especially in urban area. As the population grows, people need to remove more trees. They also use the wood from the trees as lumber to make buildings and other things, or they burn the trees as firewood. Advantages to preserving forests: * Regulates the water cycle to some extent * Produces soil, and prevents soil erosion * Provides habitats for animals * Provides ''some'' of our oxygen (some is produced in the sea) * Regulates temperature to some extent Forests are often planted to protect against natural disasters. When forests are lost, very often the soil they protected is also lost. This loss of soil is called erosion. Trees are important for carbon sequestration. To [https://fsc.org/en/blog/what-is-deforestation combat deforestation] we need to first acknowledge the problems in front of us and come with innovative solutions. When the trees burn or rot, the carbon in them returns to the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide. Since carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, deforestation causes global warming. Tropical deforestation is responsible for about 20% of world greenhouse gas emissions. Deforestation continues. == References == ==Related pages== *Desertification *Illegal logging *Reforesting ==Other websites== *[http://www.climateactionprogramme.org/news/asia_pulp_paper_announces_end_to_deforestation_in_indonesia/ APP & APRIL announces end to deforestation in Indonesia] Category:Forests Category:Environmental issues
