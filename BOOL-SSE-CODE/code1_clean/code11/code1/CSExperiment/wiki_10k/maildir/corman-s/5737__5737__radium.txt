File:Radium226.jpg '''Radium''' is a chemical element. The Chemical symbol for radium is '''Ra''', and its atomic number is 88. It was discovered by Marie Curie and Pierre Curie in the form of radium chloride in 1898. It is a slivery-white alkaline earth metal, but it turns black quickly when it is exposed to nitrogen in the air. All isotopes of radium are Ionizing radiation. The radioactivity of radium causes it to Radioluminescence. Radium is used in many things, such as glowing watches, which are now banned because they can cause radiation poisoning. Some of the things radium was used for are now made using less dangerous radioactive elements, such as promethium. It can be used in treating cancer.

It does not exist naturally inside of people or other living things; it is dangerous when Exposure (toxicology) because it takes the same place as calcium. == History == Radium was discovered by Marie Curie and her husband Pierre Curie on 21 December 1898. They found that some radioactive Mineral had unknown compounds left over after removing uranium and barium. The unknown compounds were polonium and radium; the discovery was announced to the French Academy of Sciences on 26 December 1898. The original unit of measurement for radioactivity was called the Curie (unit). The unit was equal to the radioactivity of one gram of radium-226, but later it was changed to 3.7×1010 disintegrations per second. == Properties == Radium is the heaviest alkaline earth metal and the only radioactive element in the group. It has a silvery-white color, but turns black when it is exposed to air. It is more similar to barium than it is to any other element. It is also similar to barium in the ways it reacts with other things. Radium has 33 Isotope. All of these isotopes are radioactive. The isotope which lasts the longest is radium-226: it has a Half-life (element) of 1,600 years. == Uses == Radium used to be used in glowing paints for watches and other instruments that are used in the dark. Radium stopped being used in the mid-1920s after a lawsuit by five people who were called "Radium girls". The Radium Girls were told to lick the brushes used to paint with radium, which caused them to ingest radium. This was very dangerous to their health. Ingesting radium in paint caused sores, anemia, and Bone tumor in the Radium Girls. The lawsuit caused the dangers of radioactivity to be known by many more people. After the 1960s, radium paint was replaced by less dangerous radioactive paint made from promethium-147 or tritium. Radium was also used in different things such as toothpaste and food. These products were made illegal after people found out about the dangers of radioactivity. Radium is not used now in anything except for Nuclear reactor. There are safer elements that can be used in all of the same ways radium was used. == Toxicity == Radium is the most Poison radioactive element. It collects in bones when ingested, which causes cancer. However, even just being around radium can cause cancer. Radium creates radon when it radioactive decay. This is even more dangerous, because radon is a gas. Marie Curie's death was most likely caused by radium. ==References== Category:Alkaline earth metals
