It can be made from wine or other liquids containing alcohol, like cider, fermentation fruit juices, or fermentation malt. Ethanol is oxidation from the liquid, resulting in vinegar. Vinegar made from Date palm is a traditional product of the Middle East. It can also be made through the use of certain bacteria. Vinegar contains about 5% of acetic acid. The acid makes it Sourness. In cooking, it is often used as a condiment to add to salad, fish, french fries and vegetables like pickles and cabbage. It is much used in salad dressings. The pH of vinegar depends on how much acid is in it. Apple cider vinegar is typically between pH 4.25 and 5.00 if undiluted. Distilled vinegar has a pH of around 2.4. There are many types of vinegar, such as balsamic vinegar, red wine, and apple cider vinegar. It is also shown above as well as the others. == Other websites == * citizendium:Vinegar -Citizendium == References == Category:Condiments
