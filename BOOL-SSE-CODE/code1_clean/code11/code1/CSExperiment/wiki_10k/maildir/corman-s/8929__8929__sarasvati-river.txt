'''Sarasvati River''' was one of the major rivers of Pakistan. The river flowed through parts of western and northern India. Then in Allahabad, the river merged with the Jamuna River. At one time, Sarasvati was a deep river. The river dried up and became lost over a few hundred years, possibly between 2000 and 1500 BC. == References == Category:Rivers of Pakistan Category:Tributaries of the Indus River Category:Rivers of India
