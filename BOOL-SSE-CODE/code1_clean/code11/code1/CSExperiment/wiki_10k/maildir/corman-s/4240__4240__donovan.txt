File:Donovan Washington 2007.jpg '''Donovan Phillips Leitch''' (born 10 May 1946 in Maryhill, Glasgow, Scotland) is a Scotland-born pop music singer and acoustic guitar, who was popular in the 1960s. Early in his career he was compared to Bob Dylan, but he developed his own musical style, which included elements of jazz and Indian music. (Donovan and Dylan met during 1965, and became friends.) Donovan's best-remembered songs include "Catch The Wind", "Mellow Yellow", "Sunshine Superman", "Happiness Runs", and "Hurdy Gurdy Man". He helped the The Beatles with their song "Yellow Submarine", and two Beatles (John Lennon and Paul McCartney) sang on his song "Atlantis". Donovan was one of the first pop musicians to wikt:denounce the use of Illegal drugs, after his own arrest for hashish possession in 1966, and his seeing friends begin to use "hard drugs" like heroin and speed (amphetamine). The liner notes to his 1967 album ''A Gift From a Flower to a Garden'' called upon young people to "stop the use of ''all'' drugs, and heed the quest to seek the Sun." (He later resumed occasional marijuana use, and drinking alcohol.) After the 1960s, Donovan's music was not as popular as it had been, but it is remembered now as part of the flower power era. Many of his songs now appear in television Television advertisement. He continued to make albums regularly through the 1980s, and sometimes in the 1990s. He also continued to tour, and some of his later albums are of live performances. He wikt:publication an wikt:autobiography, ''The Hurdy Gurdy Man'', in 2005. Two of Donovan's children, Donovan Leitch and Ione Skye, are actors. ==Other websites== * [http://www.donovan.ie/ Official Site] * [http://donovan-unofficial.com/ Donovan Unofficial Site] * [http://www.mossiehigh.com/Donovan/ Complete discography] * [https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19823/m1/ Hear Donovan] on the Pop Chronicles (1969).
