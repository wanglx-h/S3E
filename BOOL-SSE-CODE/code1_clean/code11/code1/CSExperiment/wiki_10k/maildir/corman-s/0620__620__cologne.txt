It is on the Rhine River. About 1,060,000 people live there, making Cologne the biggest city in North Rhine-Westphalia. It is in the southern part of the 'Rhine-Ruhr agglomeration' of cities with a combined total population of about 10 million people. This is one of the most densely populated areas of the world. Cologne has an oceanic climate (''Cfb'' in the Koeppen climate classification). ==History== The city was founded by the Roman Empire in the year 50 AD. Before that, it was a Roman castle ("castellum") and a town inhabited by a local German tribe named ''Ubier'' at least for 100 years. Archaeologists have found out that the surrounding area was populated already during the Stone Age. Traditionally, the city was always Roman Catholic. That changed only recently after the Second World War, as a result of massive immigration of Protestants from the East Germany. Still the largest number of people, 41.6%, are Roman Catholic, compared to 17% Protestant. 10% of the people are Muslim. ==Sights== The most interesting thing to see there is Cologne Cathedral. This Church (building) was built from about 1248 to about 1550, but completed only in 1880. The United Nations list it as 'World Cultural Heritage'. Cologne's archbishop Rainald von Dassel brought the relics of the biblical Biblical Magi there in 1164. They are kept in a very beautiful Shrine of the Three Kings at Cologne Cathedral in the cathedral. Three golden crowns in the coat of arms of the city symbolize them. They made Cologne a major place of pilgrimage. The University of Cologne alone has more than 50,000 students. It was founded 1919 and is one of the biggest universities in Germany. There are several specialized Schools in addition to the university. The ''Hochschule für Musik'' is the biggest academy of music in Europe. Cologne has two colleges of arts and the sports college again is one of the biggest institutions of its kind worldwide. Cologne has 31 museums. It has one of the busiest train stations in Europe. It is the only train station next to a big cathedral. ==Culture== People in Cologne and nearby have their own dialect. They call it Kölsch (language). During Carnival time it even appears on nationwide broadcasts. Cologne has a handful of broadcasting stations. The WDR, part of the network ARD, is the biggest producer of television and radio programs in Germany. Cologne is also famous for Eau de Cologne (''Kölnisch Wasser''). ==Related pages== * Berlin * Bonn (nearby city) * Düsseldorf (nearby city) * Frankfurt/Main * Hamburg * Leverkusen (nearby city) * Munich == References == == Other websites == * [http://www.koeln.de German page on the city] * [http://www.uni-koeln.de German page of the University] * [http://www.koelner-dom.de German page of the cathedral] * [http://www.wdr.de German page of the broadcasting station ''Westdeutscher Rundfunk''] Category:Cities in North Rhine-Westphalia Category:Cologne Category:1st-century establishments in Europe Category:Establishments in Germany Category:50s establishments
