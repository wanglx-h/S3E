Its former name was '''Loanda'''. It is a main seaport of the country on the Atlantic Ocean. In 1995, about 3 million people lived there. It is a center of manufacturing, but very destroyed because of a Angolan Civil War. It was founded by Portugal in 1575 as '''São Paulo de Luanda''' and has been the administrative center of Angola since 1627 (except for 1640–1648). When Angola got independence in 1975, it became the capital of Angola. ==References== Category:Cities in Angola Category:National capitals in Africa Category:1575 establishments Category:Luanda Province
