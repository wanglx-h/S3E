File:E cursiva.gif :''For the drug sometimes referred to E, see Ecstasy (drug).'' '''E''' is the fifth (number 5) letter in the English language alphabet. In English language, E has two main sounds when it is spoken as a vowel. Usually it is a short E ('''ĕ'''), but sometimes it is a long E ('''ē'''). E is also a silent E ('''e̸''') when it is used as a consonant (silent letter). Also, it is the most commonly used letter in the English dictionary. One more thing in English is the so-called '''magic E''', also known as the '''bossy E'''. That is when E almost makes a vowel long or C, G or Q(u) soft in any part of a word. Two examples are '''name''', which is pronounced as n'''ā'''m, and '''gem''', which is pronounced '''j'''em. == Typographic types of E == The types of E include (but may not be limited to) capital '''E''' lower-case '''e''' '''é''' '''È''' '''è''' '''Ê''' '''ê''' '''Ë''' '''É''' '''ë''' '''Ě''' '''ě''' '''Ē''' '''ē''' '''Ĕ''' '''ĕ''' '''Ė''' '''ė''' '''Ę''' '''ę''' ''None'' of these different types are used in English language, except occasionally '''É'''/'''é''' for some French language words such fiancé, café, and crème brûlée. == Meanings for E == These meanings are for E/e as a separate letter. * In computers, the letter E is often used to start other words to mean "electronics", like in e-mail or e-commerce. * In money, E is commonly used as a symbol for the euro when the symbol € is not available. * In music, E is a Note (music), sometimes referred to as “Mi”. * In mathematics, E in its lowercase form (e (mathematical constant)) is a Mathematical constant about 2.718; see e (mathematical constant) * In ''Wheel of Fortune (US game show)'', E is one of the six letters given to any contestant participating in the "Bonus Round." * E! is an United States television network ==Other websites== Category:Vowel letters
