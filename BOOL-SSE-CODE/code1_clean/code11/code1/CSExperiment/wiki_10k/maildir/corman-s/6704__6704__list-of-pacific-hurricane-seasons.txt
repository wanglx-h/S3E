Subject: List of Pacific hurricane seasons
The following is a '''list of Pacific hurricane seasons'''. They all began on May 15 in the eastern Pacific and June 1 in the central Pacific in their respective years. There, they end on November 30. These dates are when tropical cyclones usually form in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Before the satellite (artificial) age started in the 1960s, data on east Pacific hurricanes is extremely unreliable.
