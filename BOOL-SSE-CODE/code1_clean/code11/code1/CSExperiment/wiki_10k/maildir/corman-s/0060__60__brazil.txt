That group of Indigenous peoples is often called the South American Native Americans and probably came from North America. They practiced hunting, foraging, and farming. Over thousands of years, many different indigenous people were living there. File: Flag of Portugal sea (1500).svg Pedro Álvares Cabral was the first Europe to see Brazil. He saw it in 1500. He was from Portugal and the Portuguese kingdom claimed Brazil. Soon, Portugal Colonization Brazil and created colonies all along the coastline. They began to import Black people Slavery from Africa and force them to work. Because of the violence of the slave masters, many of these slaves would Maroon (people) into the forest and create their own communities called quilombos. In the late 1500s and early 1600s, the Dutch and the French tried to take some land in Brazil. Dutch, French, and Portuguese started moving inland further than the Treaty of Tordesillas said they could. This caused some fights with the Spaniards (people from Spain) and indigenous people in the area. In 1822, Brazil declared independence from Portugal. Soon there was civil war. Meanwhile, the quilombos survived and Brazil was bringing in more slaves than any other country in the Americas, even though many countries were beginning to legally Abolitionism slavery. This led to an increase in slave revolts, especially in the 1860s and 1880s, which forced the government to change the system to keep the country stable. Slavery was legally abolished in 1888. In 1889, there was a military coup, and Pedro II had to leave the country. In 1889, Brazil became a republic. The only people who could vote were people who owned land. There were some uprisings in the 1920s because some people thought the government was unfairly helping coffee growers. Brazil joined the Allies of World War II during World War II. During the 1960s, the military leader Castelo Branco overthrew the government and created a dictatorship that was supported by the United States. It was very anti-communist and they Prison, Torture, or Killing many people on Left-wing.
