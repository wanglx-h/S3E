Subject: Evidence
'''Evidence''' is something that is used to support an argument. It gives examples of why something is truth. '''Evidence''' is defined by Merriam-Webster dictionary as: 1a : an outward sign : INDICATION 1b : something that furnishes proof : TESTIMONY specifically: something legally submitted to a tribunal to ascertain the truth of a matter 2 : one who bears witness especially: one who voluntarily confesses a crime and testifies for the prosecution against one's accomplices Choo states “Evidence is the information with which the matters requiring proof in a trial are proved.” The study of evidence, therefore, is the study of the process by which such matters are proved in court.” (Choo, 42). Peter Achinstein defines evidence as “information that increases probability of a hypothesis” or “information on the basis of which a hypothesis has high probability.” (Achinstein, 44). The Division of Extension Research and Training at the University of Arkansas defines evidence as “the outward sign, the indication, the proof” (University of Arkansas, 1). For example, if someone come across a cup of spilled milk, that person could look for evidence as to how the milk was spilled. If hairs of a cat and paw wikt:print were found on the ground, they could be evidence that a cat was the cause of the spilled milk. If a witness saw the cat spilling the milk, her testimony would also be evidence. == References == Category:Law Category:Criminal investigation Category:Epistemology Choo, Andrew. Evidence.
