Adolf Hitler is on the left; Rudolf Hess is second from right]] The '''Beer Hall Putsch''' was a failed coup d'état in Munich, Weimar Republic between the evening of 8 November and the morning of 9 November 1923. During the Putsch, the Nazi Party under Adolf Hitler tried to take over the government of Bavaria, a States of Germany in Germany. They took several hundred people hostage in a beer hall (a large building where people got together to drink beer and sometimes listen to political speeches). Several Nazis died when they got into a gun fight with police officers in another part of Munich. Hitler went to prison for eight months and wrote his manifesto ''Mein Kampf'' during that time. == Reasoning == Hitler chose to launch the Putsch for many reasons. At the time, Germany was the Weimar Republic. The Republic and its government were weak because of fighting between Right-wing politics and Left-wing politics Political party. Because of inflation, many people did not have enough money to pay daily expenses. Sometimes, wages or pensions were not paid. The Weimar Republic's financial problems started when Germany lost World War I. Treaty of Versailles, and Germany had to make taxes very high in order to pay. This hurt Germany's economy. In the early 1920s, the Nazi Party was getting very strong. Hitler was a strong leader. In 1923, the year when the Weimar Republic was least popular, the Nazi Party grew from 6,000 members to 55,000. With the Putsch, Hitler wanted to take control of the government by force. He wanted to copy Benito Mussolini, Italy's Fascism dictator, who took power by Invasion Rome. == Attempted coup == File:FrMeinKampf20050214.jpg wrote ''Mein Kampf'' while in prison after the Beer Hall Putsch]] On 8 November 1923, Hitler and his men entered the Beer Hall and took several hundred people hostage. The Sturmabteilung (the Nazi Party paramilitary force) also took over the Army Headquarters, but they forgot to capture the Telegraphy office. This meant that anybody could call the police. The Putsch failed. A day after it started, 16 Nazis and 4 Bavarian State Police officers were killed in a gunfight in ''Residenzstraße''. Hitler was arrested two days later. == Results == After the Beer Hall Putsch, Hitler and some other participants were sent to prison for treason. Two other important Nazi Party officials, Hermann Göring and Rudolf Hess, were also imprisoned. They would later play key roles in the The Holocaust. Hitler spent about 8 months in prison, and the Nazi Party broke up after the Putsch (thought it would later get back together). The Putsch made Hitler famous. Before the Putsch, he was unknown, but afterwards many people learned about him. He was a hero to many people after the Putsch. After the governments of the Weimar Republic, many German people wanted strong leadership, and some thought Hitler would provide that. In prison Hitler wrote ''Mein Kampf'' (''My Struggle''), which became one of the most famous books in history. It sold millions of copies at the time and taught many people about Hitler's ideas. Rudolf Hess helped with the book; Hitler told Hess what he wanted to say and Hess wrote it down. After the Putsch, Hitler rethought his strategy. He realised he could not take power using violence, the way Mussolini had in Italy. Instead, he had to get power through being Election. == Causalities == File:Hitler portrait crop.jpg led the Beer Hall Putsch. He later led Nazi Germany and committed the Holocaust]] Sixteen participants in the Beer Hall Putsch died during the takeover.
