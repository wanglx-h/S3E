This is from an old word that means "act or time of springing or appearing; the first appearance; the beginning, birth, rise, or origin". Spring as a word came from Middle English's ''springen'', from Old English's ''springan.'' These meant to go up or burst forward. These are like modern German language's ''springen'', which means 'jump'. It is not thought that these words were talking about the season. They all come from the Proto-Germanic language ''sprenganan.''
