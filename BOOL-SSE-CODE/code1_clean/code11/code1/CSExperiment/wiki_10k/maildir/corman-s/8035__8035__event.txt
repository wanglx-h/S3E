Subject: Event
An '''event''' is something which happens or takes place. An event is brief, possibly extremely brief. Not like a process, which takes time. *Alternate meaning: an important activity, an item in a program, or the program as a whole. ==Culture== * A special occasion, such as a wedding or other party, is a social event. == Science == * In physics (and in some kinds of philosophy), an event occurs at a point in time which can be distinguished because the state (disambiguation) of the world changed. Something was different before and after the event. * In special relativity (and general relativity), an event is a point in the spacetime continuum, i.e. it has a position in Space (physics) and time. * In experimental particle physics, an event (particle physics) refers to a set of elementary particle interactions recorded in a brief span of time. * In probability a possible outcome of an experiment is called an elementary event, while a set of those (a subset of all) is called simply an event. * In palaeontology, one speaks of List of extinction events. == Telecommunications == * In information processing, an event is a change in the property received by an observer after being transmitted from an wikt:object. * In computer science, an event is a software message that indicates something has happened. See event-driven programming. A number of protocols, such as MIDI, are also event-based.
