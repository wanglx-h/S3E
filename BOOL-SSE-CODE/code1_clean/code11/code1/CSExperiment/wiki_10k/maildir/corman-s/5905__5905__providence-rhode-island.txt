This metropolitan area includes almost all of Rhode Island and part of Massachusetts. Providence is at the mouth of the Providence River, at the head of Narragansett Bay. The city's small footprint is crisscrossed by streets at odd angles and has a rapidly changing distribution of residents. Providence was founded in 1636 by Roger Williams (theologian), a religious exile from the Massachusetts Bay Colony. He named the area in honor of "God's merciful Providence" which he believed was responsible for revealing such a haven for him and his followers to settle. The official name of the state includes the name of the city, ''Rhode Island and Providence Plantations''. After being one of the first cities in the country to industrialize, Providence became noted for its jewelry and silver (household) industry. Today, the City of Providence is home to eight hospitals and seven institutions of higher learning, which has shifted the city's economy into service industries, although it still retains significant manufacturing activity. From colonial times to the mid-19th century, the Rhode Island General Assembly rotated meetings between the state's five county court houses. After 1853 the state legislature stopped meeting at the Kent, Washington and Bristol county courthouses, but continued to alternate its sessions between Providence State House and the Newport State House in Newport. Early in the 20th century, Providence became the only capital of the state. ==Hurricanes== On 1938 New England hurricane, a severe Category-3 hurricane struck Providence and nearby areas.
