In 2020, the population of Charlotte according to the U.S. Census Bureau was 874,579. In addition, the population of Charlotte's metro area is listed as 2,660,329. == History == The first people settled at the place where Charlotte is in 1755 when a man named Thomas Polk built a house near two Native American trading paths. More people started living in the area and in 1768 it became a town named Charlotte Town. It was named after Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, the wife of King George III, because the townspeople wanted him to like them and not have him pass unfair laws. For this reason, the city is nicknamed the 'Queen City'. However, despite naming the city after his wife, George III still passed laws that the people in Charlotte did not like. So, on May 20, 1775, the people in Charlotte signed a proclamation that later was called the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence. They did not want to be ruled by the king anymore so eleven days later they had a meeting and made new laws for their town. In the early 1800s, many churches started to form in Charlotte. That is why Charlotte is sometimes called “The City of Churches.” In 1799, a boy found a big rock. When a jeweler told his family that it was gold, the first gold rush in the United States started.[http://www.blanchardonline.com/AmericanRarities/archive-08/dah.html Blanchard Online: American Rarities] (Retrieved on 05-22-07) A lot of gold was found. More gold was found in North Carolina then any other state until the California Gold Rush of 1848. Some people in Charlotte still enjoy looking for gold. After the American Civil War Charlotte became a busy town. Cotton farmers brought their cotton to Charlotte to ship it on trains. Even more people started living in Charlotte during World War I.
