A '''court''' in a law, is a part of the government in which people come together to decide how to apply the country's laws to a specific situation, especially when there is an argument over how to apply the law. Some disagreements a court may decide are whether a person is guilty of a crime, who is the legal owner of property, or who the children of two divorced parents should live with. The system of courts that interprets and applies the law is commonly known as the judiciary. A court is usually located in a special building called a courthouse. Most countries have multiple courts to deal with different issues. For example, civil law courts deal with private disputes between people or organizations, while criminal law courts deal with people who have been accused of crimes. == Types of courts == * Appellate court * Court-martial * Constitutional court * International court * Supreme court * Trial court Category:Courts (law)
