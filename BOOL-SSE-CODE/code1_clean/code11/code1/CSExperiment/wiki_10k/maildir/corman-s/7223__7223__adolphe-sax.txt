Adolphe's first important invention was an improvement of the bass clarinet design. He patented this at the age of twenty-four. In 1841, Sax moved to Paris. Around this time he invented the saxophone. He got a job teaching at the Paris Conservatoire starting in 1867. Sax suffered from lip cancer between 1853 and 1858 but made a full recovery.
