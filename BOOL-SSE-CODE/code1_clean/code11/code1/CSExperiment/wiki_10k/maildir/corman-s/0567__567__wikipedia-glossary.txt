Many of these words are jargon. ;'''!vote''' :A entry on a WP:RFD discussion that is not a vote. ;'''Article''' :An encyclopaedia entry. All articles are pages, but not all pages are articles.

The four most common are to check for copyright violations, to determine which term among several is the most widely used, to decide whether a person is famous enough to have an article or is just making the page because of vanity, and to check whether a questionable and uncommon topic is real (instead of a fake invention written about by a person).
