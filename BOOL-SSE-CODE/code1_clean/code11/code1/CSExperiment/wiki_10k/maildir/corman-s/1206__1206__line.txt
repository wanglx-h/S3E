A '''line''' is the path of one Point (geometry) that is moving. A line is a type of geometric wikt:figure. A line has length, but no width. A line is made up of an Infinity number of points. == Straight and curved lines == File:CVsimp.svg A line can be wikt:straight or curved. In geometry, the word ''line'' means a ''straight line''. A straight line is the shortest distance between two points. A straight line is traced by a point moving in a direction that does not wikt:change. A ''curved line'' is sometimes called a curve. The edge of a circle is not straight. It is an example of a curve. == Line segments == A ''line segment'' is part of a line. Here are examples of straight line segments: ::: ::: _____ __ ::: == Naming lines == Lines can get their names from any two points on the line. For example, if a line contains two different points, named A and B, then the line can be called either \overleftrightarrow{AB}, or \overleftrightarrow{BA}. Sometimes, lines are named with just one symbol. A letter such as \ell might be used. == Two lines == Two lines can be: * parallel (geometry): Two lines are parallel if they are on the same Plane (mathematics) and they never touch. * Concurrent: Two lines are concurrent if they touch on one point. * Coincident: Two lines are coincident if they are made of the same points. * Perpendicular: Two lines are perpendicular if they make four right angles where they touch. * Skew lines: In Euclidean space, two lines are skew if they are not parallel but they never touch. ==Related pages== * Linear function * Point (geometry) * Plane (mathematics) == References == Category:Basic English 850 words Category:Geometry
