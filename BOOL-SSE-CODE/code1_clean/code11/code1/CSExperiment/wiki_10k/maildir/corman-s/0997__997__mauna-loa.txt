It is considered to be the largest subaerial (from the bottom of the Pacific Ocean) volcano in the world and the tallest volcano in Hawaii. == Name == ''Mauna Loa'' is Hawaiian language for "long mountain". ==Size== The volcano is at least in volume and over 4 kilometers above sea level. Measured from its base on the ocean floor, it reaches above 8 kilometers, making it the tallest mountain on Earth, but not the highest. That distinction is reserved for Mount Everest. Measured from sea level Mauna Loa is 4,169 meters high.Kaye, G.D.

It is also one of the largest volcanoes measuring 96 kilometers long and 48 kilometers wide. The world's biggest volcano is named Mauna Loa in Hawaii. Mauna Loa is part of the five volcanoes on Hawaii Island. The most recent time this volcano erupted was in 2022. It erupted 33 times in the last 170 years. Like all the other Hawaiian volcanoes, Mauna Loa was created by the movement of the Pacific tectonic plate which moved over the Hawaii hotspot (geology) in the Earth's mantle. It is a shield volcano. The largest recent eruption from Mauna Loa left a lava trail 51 kilometers long. ==References== Category:Volcanoes of Hawaii
