Subject: Proton decay
'''Proton decay''' is a theory that a proton could decay into two small particles, a pion and a positron. This would be a new type of radioactive decay. So far, proton decay has not been observed, but some physicists believe it. Most current theories say that protons do not decay. Category:Nuclear physics
