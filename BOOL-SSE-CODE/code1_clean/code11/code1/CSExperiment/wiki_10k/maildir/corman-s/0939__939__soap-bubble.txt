File:soapbubble.sky.250px.jpg File:H._A._Brendekilde_-_Sæbebobler_(1906).jpg A '''soap bubble''' is a very thin film of soap water. Their shape is a wikt:hollow, round ball, or sphere. They have a colorful surface. Soap bubbles do not last very long. Sometimes they break in the air. When they touch something else, they usually break. When people talk about soap bubbles they think about them being pretty but short-lived. So, they are a symbol for other things that are pretty but short-lived or unimportant. Children enjoy playing with bubbles. Sometimes, adults enjoy seeing art done with soap bubbles. They get their colors from iridescence. == Artists == * Tom Noddy, author of ''Bubble Magic'', * Keith Michael Johnson,http://www.keithmichaeljohnson.com/ Unterseite Bubble Show anclicken * Fan Yang,http://www.bubbleart.com/ * Louis Pearl, * Reinhold Leppert, * Craig Glenday, * John Erck. == References == Category:Water
