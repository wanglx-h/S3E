File:Captain W. de W. Abney. C.B, R.E, F.R.S. President of the Camera Club. (8385712527) - crop.jpg '''William de Wiveleslie Abney''' (24 July 1843 – 3 December 1920) was an England astronomer, chemist, and photographer. Abney was a member of many scientific organizations. He was best known for his discovering and measuring the effect of adding white to a hue, in 1910. The effect is generally known as the Abney effect. For example, adding white to red makes it slightly bluish (bluish red is known as pink), and adding white to yellowish green hues makes them less yellowish and thus greener.Chambers Biographical Dictionary, , page 5 ==References== Category:1843 births Category:1920 deaths Category:English chemists Category:English astronomers Category:English photographers
