It is used as a cleaner, and as hair bleach. In a concentration (chemistry) of 3% (meaning that there are 3 grams of hydrogen peroxide for 100 grams of a water solution), it can be used to treat wounds. Over time, it will slowly become oxygen gas and water through decomposition. Chemistry often use hydrogen peroxide in chemical reactions. It is a very strong redox when used with acid and water. ''Oxidising agents'' take electrons from other compounds. : Here hydrogen peroxide takes an electron from the ions and becomes water. The iron is oxidised (loses electrons) to the ion. It can also be a redox when used with stronger oxidisers like sodium hypochlorite. When it acts as a reducing agent, oxygen gas is also produced. ''Reducing agents'' give electrons to other compounds. This method is often used to make oxygen in laboratory. : Hydrogen peroxide can be bought in shops when mixed with lots of water but is very dangerous when the concentration is higher. Because it is an oxidiser, it can cause flammable materials to ignite. Category:Oxygen compounds Category:Hydrogen compounds
