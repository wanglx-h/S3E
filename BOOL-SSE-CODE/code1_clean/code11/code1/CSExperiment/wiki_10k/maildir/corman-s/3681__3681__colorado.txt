Its Capital (city) and largest city is Denver, Colorado. Other large cities are Colorado Springs, Colorado and Aurora, Colorado. Colorado became the 38th US state admitted to the union on August 1, 1876. ==History== Native Americans first settled in Colorado. The prominent Colorado Native Americans are the Navajo, Ute, and Cheyenne-Arapahoe Indians. The state was named after the Colorado River by Spanish explorers. US Army officer and amateur explorer Zebulon Pike was recruited by the United States government in 1806 to find the source of the Mississippi River and to check out Spanish settlements in New Mexico. Even though his recorded location for the source of the Mississippi was extremely inaccurate and allegedly got lost in his expedition, he did explore much of what would become the Southwestern United States. When he reached what is now Colorado Springs, Colorado, he named a mountain after himself, Pikes Peak, which remains a symbol for the city as well as the state to this day. Colorado has a long history of mining and digging for gold. It is the place where the Pike's Peak Gold Rush took place. When gold in California was becoming harder and harder to find, people came to Colorado in large numbers when gold was discovered there in 1859, ten years after the California Gold Rush began. Many mining camps set up in Colorado would later become cities, such as Denver City and Boulder City. The motto for the gold rush was "Pike's Peak or Bust". ==Geography== File:National-atlas-colorado.png The State of Colorado is shaped like a rectangle. The borders are latitude and longitude lines. The four borders are at 37°N, 41°N, 102°03'W, and 109°03'W. (The east and west borders are 25°W and 32°W from the Washington Meridian.) Colorado, Wyoming, and Utah are the only three U.S. states that have only lines of latitude and longitude for boundaries and that have no natural borders. When government surveyors made the border markers for the "Territory of Colorado", minor surveying mistakes made many small wikt:twist along the borders, most seen along the border with the "Territory of Utah." The tip of Mount Elbert at 14,440 Foot (unit of length) (4,401m) elevation in Lake County is the state's highest point and the highest point in the entire Rocky Mountains. Colorado has more than 100 mountain peaks that reach over 4,000 meters (13,123ft) in height. Colorado is the only U.S. state that lies wikt:entirely above 1,000meters (3,281ft) in height. Colorado has the highest average elevation of any state at 6,800ft. It borders New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, and Wyoming. The land area of Colorado is roughly the same size as New Zealand. ===Climate=== The weather and temperatures in Colorado are quite different wikt:compared to most of the United States. In most other states, the southern part is warmer than the northern part, southern Colorado is not noticeably warmer than northern Colorado. Mountains and surrounding valleys greatly wikt:affect wikt:local climate. As a normal rule, with an wikt:increase in height comes a wikt:decrease in temperature and an increase in rain. The Rocky Mountains on the west have a very different climate than the Great Plains on the east. Between these two areas is a smaller mountain range known as "the Foothills". ==Population== File:Colorado population map.png The state's largest city, and capital (city), is Denver. The "Denver-Aurora-Boulder Combined Statistical Area", is home to 2,927,911 people, it has more than two-thirds of the state's population. As of 2005, Colorado has an wikt:estimated population of 4,665,177, which is an wikt:increase of 63,356, or 1.4%, from the last year and an increase of 363,162, or 8.4%, since the year 2000. This has a natural increase since the last census of 205,321 people (that is 353,091 births minus 147,770 deaths) and an increase because of human migration of 159,957 people into the state. Immigration from outside the United States makes a net increase of 112,217 people, and migration within the country made a net increase of 47,740 people. ===Religion=== File:Colorado Rocky Mtn Church.jpg.]] File:USAFA Chapel from terrazzo.JPG near Colorado Springs, Colorado.]] Colorado's most common religion is Christianity, and its most common Christian denomination is Catholicism. Colorado, and mostly the city of Colorado Springs, serves as the headquarters of many Christian groups, many of them Evangelicalism.

Major religious affiliations of the people of Colorado are: * Christian – 65% * Protestant — 44% * Unaffiliated – 25% * Evangelical – 23% * Mainline — 19% * Roman Catholic — 19% * Other Religions – 5% * Jewish — 2% * Latter Day Saint / Mormon— 2% * Other Protestant – 2% * Muslim — 1% * Eastern Orthodox Church — 1% ==Economy== The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates the total state product in 2007 was $236 billion. Income per person in 2007 was $41,192, ranking Colorado eleventh in the United States. Early companies were based on mineral extraction and Agriculture. Today's agricultural products are cattle, wheat, dairy products, corn, and hay. On January 1, 2014 Colorado became the first state to make marijuana legal. In the first week of 2014, $5 million of marijuana was sold. The marijuana industry was expected to add $359 million to Colorado's economy by the end of 2014. ==Related pages== * List of counties in Colorado * List of rivers of Colorado == References == Category:Colorado Category:1876 establishments in the United States
