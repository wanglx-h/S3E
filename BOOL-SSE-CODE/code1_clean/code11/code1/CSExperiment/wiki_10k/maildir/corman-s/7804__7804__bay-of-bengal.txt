File:Bay of Bengal map.png The '''Bay of Bengal''' is a bay in the northeastern part of the Indian Ocean, west of the Malay Peninsula and east of India. It looks like a triangle. It is called the "Bay of Bengal", because to the north are the Indian state of West Bengal and the country of Bangladesh. It is an extended part of the Indian Ocean, but part of the sea landed on part of Bangladesh. It has four sea ports on part of Bangladesh. BIMSTEC (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation) supports free trade internationally around the Bay of Bengal between Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. == References == Category:Bays of Asia Category:Indian Ocean
