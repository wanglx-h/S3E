File:Parthenon (30276156187).jpg of Ancient Greece]] '''Ancient history''' is all the events we know about between the invention of writing and the start of the Middle Ages. Writing is one of the greatest inventions of the human species. It was invented after the Neolithic revolution in which people settled in small towns and started agriculture. Writing dates from about 3,300 BC, which is over 5000 years ago, in the Middle East. The first people to use writing were the Sumerians and the Ancient Egyptians.Robinson. Andrew 1995. ''The story of writing''. Thames & Hudson, London. Before writing, the only things we have are the tools and monuments made by earlier people. This is studied by archaeology rather than history. The period of ancient history ends with the early Middle Ages. == Study of ancient history == Finding facts about ancient history is difficult because people wrote less in those times: only scribes could write. Most of what they did write has been lost. There were very few copies made because there was no printing at that time. What people wrote they wrote by hand. More people could read and write in Ancient Rome than in other places but much of what they wrote is now lost. === Archaeology === Archaeology is looking at things that were made or used in the past to learn about that time. Things like Pottery, solid tools, and metal weapons often exist at the same time. Things like paper, wood, and cloth can be easily broken, burnt or damaged. Some ancient things found using archaeology are: * The Egyptian pyramids - Big tombs made by the Ancient Egyptians for their king and queens. * The city of Pompeii - A city from Ancient Rome. When a volcano (a mountain that makes fire and hot rocks) killed the people living there, the city was buried and the things inside it were covered with rock and ash. This meant that they did not change for a long time. * The Terracotta Army - the tomb of the First Qing dynasty Emperor in Ancient China. === Primary sources === Primary sources are written by people who lived in ancient times. They tell us most of what we know about ancient history. But people in ancient history may have believed different things from each other. They may also be wrong. Some famous people who wrote ancient history are: Herodotus, Josephus, Livy, Polybius, Suetonius, Tacitus, Thucydides and Sima Qian. == Chronology == === Prehistory === * The human race evolved in Africa.
