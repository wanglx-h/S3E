The city's population is 321,992. It is the 42nd-largest city and the oldest European settlement in United States territory. Today, San Juan is Puerto Rico's most important port. == History == San Juan was founded in 1521. It was named after San Juan Bautista, or St. John the Baptist (name given by Christopher Columbus). San Juan is also known as "La Ciudad Amurallada". This means the "Wall city". Many Spain explorers came during the Age of Discovery and built forts, churches, and other historical buildings. "La Fortaleza" (also known as "Palacio de Santa Catalina") is an example of a very old fort in San Juan. In the 16th century, San Juan was a Spanish Empire fortress against Caribs. (These were the people Indigenous peoples to the Caribbean islands and Central America.) San Juan has many old buildings still standing today. One is the Casas de los Contrasfuertes (House of Buttress), the oldest residence in Old San Juan. == References == Category:Cities in Puerto Rico Category:Municipalities of Puerto Rico Category:United States capital cities Category:1521 establishments Category:1520s establishments in North America Category:Establishments in Puerto Rico
