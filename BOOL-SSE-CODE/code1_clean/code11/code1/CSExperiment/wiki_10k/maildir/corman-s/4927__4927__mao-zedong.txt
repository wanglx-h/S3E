According to Deng Xiaoping, Mao was "seven parts right and three parts wrong ... [his] contributions are primary [most important] and his mistakes secondary [less important]".

They blame him for making China lose its most important ally, the Soviet Union, in the Sino-Soviet split.

Reacting to this population growth, Chinese leaders after Mao began the One-child policy. Over the long term, this made the Chinese population much smaller. === Language === Mao made several changes to the Chinese language. For example, he switched from the Wade-Giles system of Romanisation to Pinyin. For this reason, Nanking is now called Nanjing on modern Map. (Taiwan still uses Wade-Giles, so its capital is called Taipei instead of the pinyin Taibei.) Mao also simplified Chinese characters. He thought this would make them easier to read and write, so that more people would be Literacy. Many of Mao's successors (except Xi Jinping) had less power than he did. === Ideology === Mao created an ideology called Maoism. This ideology spread across China, and influenced many people around the world. Many communist parties around the world believe in Maoism. == Related pages == * Communism * Maoism * History of China * Great Leap Forward * Cultural Revolution * Great Chinese Famine ==Notes== ==References== == Other websites == * [https://digitalarchive.wilsoncenter.org/collection/227/foundations-of-chinese-foreign-policy "Foundations of Chinese Foreign Policy] online documents in English from the Wilson Center in Washington * [https://web.archive.org/web/20000510085445/http://www.asiasource.org/society/mao.cfm Asia Source biography] * [http://www.chinesemao.com/ ChineseMao.com: Extensive resources about Mao Zedong] * [http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/1999/china.50/inside.china/profiles/mao.tsetung/ CNN profile] * [https://web.archive.org/web/20041209035950/http://www.etext.org/Politics/MIM/classics/mao/index.html Collected Works of Mao at the Maoist Internationalist Movement] * [https://purl.fdlp.gov/GPO/gpo47030 Collected Works of Mao Tse-tung (1917–1949)] Joint Publications Research Service * [http://art-bin.com/art/omaotoc.html Mao quotations] * [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/index.htm Mao Zedong Reference Archive at marxists.org] * [http://www.oxfordreference.com/pages/samplep02 Oxford Companion to World Politics: Mao Zedong] * [https://web.archive.org/web/20130909234651/http://english.cpc.people.com.cn/66095/4468893.html Bio of Mao at the official Communist Party of China web site] * [https://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/object/188416 Photo of Chairman Mao strolling outside his official residence, 1957] Category:1893 births Category:1976 deaths Category:Chinese communist politicians Category:Former dictators Category:20th-century Chinese politicians
