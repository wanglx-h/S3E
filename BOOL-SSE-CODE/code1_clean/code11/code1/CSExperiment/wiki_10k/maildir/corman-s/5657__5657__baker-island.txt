It is just above the equator. It belongs to the United States. The United States Department of the Interior is in charge of the island. It is called the ''Baker Island National Wildlife Refuge''.[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/um.html "Baker Island" at ''CIA World Factbook''] ; excerpt, "no indigenous inhabitants"; retrieved 2013-4-19. The island has no trees. The island is surrounded by a coral reef. This makes the atoll hard to approach in a boat. == Gallery == Image:Baker Island Coastline.jpg|Baker Island coastline with red-footed booby Image:Fish and Wildlife sign on Baker Island.jpg|Fish and wildlife sign Image:Baker Day Beacon.jpg|Baker Island day beacon Image:Baker settlement remains.jpg|Settlement remains, radio tower in background Image:Baker Radio Towers.jpg|Brown noddies with radio towers in background ==Related pages== * List of uninhabited regions ==References== ==Other websites == * [http://www.fws.gov/bakerisland/ Baker Island National Wildlife Refuge] Category:Atolls Category:United States Minor Outlying Islands Category:Pacific islands Category:Islands of Oceania Category:Uninhabited regions
