File:Grabe- und Bauspaten.JPG In gardening, a '''spade''' is a tool for digging. It is similar to a shovel. It has a straight handle, usually of wood and a blade, usually of steel. For some purposes the difference between a spade and a shovel is important. For example, spade more easily digs in hard soil; a shovel more easily moves gravel. In card games a '''spade''' is one of the four shapes or "suits" of cards. Category:Basic English 850 words Category:Gardening tools
