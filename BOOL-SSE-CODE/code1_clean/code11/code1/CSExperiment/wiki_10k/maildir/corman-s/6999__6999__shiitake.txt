File:Shiitake Lentinula edodes.jpg File:Shiitake mushroom in Vegetable store in Yuen Long.jpg The '''shiitake mushroom''', or simply called "shiitake"(椎茸) (''Lentinus edodes'' or ''Lentinula edodes'') is also known as '''Chinese black mushroom''' or '''black forest mushroom'''. It is also called "black mushroom". It is an wikt:edible mushroom, which is typically grown on the tree, such as Castanopsis cuspidata kunugi and oak. There are two variant names. For high grades of shiitake is ''dōnggū'' (冬茹: どんこ) ("winter mushroom"). And another is ''huāgū'' ("flower mushroom," (香信: こうしん) which has a flower-like cracking pattern on the mushroom's upper surface). Both are produced at colder temperatures. There are many cultivated varieties, which grow-up in a temperature at 7C - 26C, most cultivars like cooler temperatures. == Notes == File:Lentinula edodes.jpg Category:Edible fungi Category:Mushrooms
