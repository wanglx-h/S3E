In 2018, Madrid made history by becoming the first club in recent history to win the Champions League three times in a row. They beat Liverpool F.C. 3–1 in 2018 UEFA Champions League Final. Since it began, Real Madrid has since spent all of its history in La Liga, and has never been Relegation down to a lower level. This shows how strong they have been just to stay in the top flight of Spanish football. In the 1940s, the club, the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium and the Ciudad Deportiva, Madrid were rebuilt after the Spanish Civil War. The club became a major force in both Spanish and European football during the 1950s. In the 1980s, the club had one of the best teams in Spain and Europe (known as ''Quinta del Buitre''). They had won two UEFA Cups, five Spanish championships in a row, one Spanish cup and three Spanish Super Cups.
