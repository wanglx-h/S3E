Its Capital city is Hartford, Connecticut, and its largest city is Bridgeport, Connecticut. It is one of the six states of New England. It borders New York (state) to the west, Massachusetts to the north, Rhode Island to the east, and the Long Island Sound to the south. Connecticut is called the "Constitution State." In 1639 settlers adopted the "Fundamental Orders," which has been called the first written constitution in history. Its current constitution (Connecticut's third) was adopted in 1965. ==Geography== Connecticut has Forest, River, Lake, Waterfall, and a Sand shore. The Connecticut River cuts through the center of the state. It flows into Long Island Sound, Connecticut's outlet (connection) to the Atlantic Ocean. === Regional variations === Even though Connecticut is small, different parts of the state have different Landscape and culture. Some areas are very rural. For example, the Litchfield Hills in northwestern Connecticut have rolling mountains and horse farms. There are many small towns and rural areas in the northeast and northwest corners of the state. Connecticut also has Industry cities, located along the coastal Highway from the New York border to New Haven, Connecticut, then northwards to Hartford, Connecticut, and farther up the coast near New London, Connecticut. The state has some very wealthy areas. The southwestern corner of Connecticut, where it touches New York State, includes Greenwich, Connecticut, Stamford, Connecticut, Fairfield, Connecticut, Westport, Connecticut, Wilton, Connecticut, and Darien, Connecticut. Some of the Wealth residents in the world live in these areas. Many towns center around a small park, known as a "green" (such as the New Haven Green). Near the green there is often a small white Church (building), a town meeting hall, a tavern, and several Thirteen Colonies houses. === Highest locations === The highest peak in Connecticut is Bear Mountain (Connecticut) in Salisbury, in the northwest corner of the state. The highest point is just east of where Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York (state) meet (Longitude; Latitude), on the southern slope of Mount Frissell, whose peak lies nearby in Massachusetts. === National Parks === The United States National Park Service maintains several areas in Connecticut. These include the: * Appalachian National Scenic Trail * Quinebaug & Shetucket Rivers Valley National Heritage Corridor * Weir Farm National Historic Site ==== The Appalachian Trail ==== The Appalachian Trail runs for about 52 miles through Connecticut, passing through hardwood forests. Appalachian Trail Conservancy|url=https://appalachiantrail.org/explore/explore-by-state/connecticut/|access-date=2024-09-29|website=Appalachian Trail Conservancy }} At its lowest, the Trail in Connecticut is 260 Foot above sea level (just under 80 Metre). At its highest, its is nearly half a mile high (2316 feet, or 796 meters). ==History== The name "Connecticut" comes from the Mohegan Indian word ''Quinnehtukqut''. This word means ''Long River Place'' or ''Beside the Long Tidal River''. === Colonial history === In 1614, a Dutch people man named Adriaen Block became the first Europe Exploration to arrive in modern-day Connecticut. After that, Dutch Fur trade sailed up the Connecticut River (which they called ''Versche Rivier''). They built a Fortification near present-day Hartford, which they called ''House of Hope'' (''Huys de Hoop'' in Dutch language). The first English people Settler arrived in 1633. They were Puritans from Massachusetts, led by the Reverend Thomas Hooker. They founded the Connecticut Colony. Colony were also established at Old Saybrook, Connecticut and New Haven, which later became part of Connecticut. Historically important colonial settlements included: * Windsor, Connecticut (1633) * Wethersfield, Connecticut (1634) * Saybrook (1635) * Hartford (1636) * New Haven (1638) * New London (1646) Because the Dutch were outnumbered by the English settlers, they left their fort in 1654. Connecticut is the fifth of the Thirteen Colonies. === Changing borders === Connecticut's western Border have changed over time. According to a 1650 agreement with the Dutch, the western boundary of Connecticut ran north from the west side of Greenwich Bay ("provided the said line come not within 10miles [16 km] of Hudson River"). On the other hand, Connecticut's original Charter in 1662 granted it all the land to the "South Sea" (the Pacific Ocean, which is on the West Coast of the United States). Connecticut got its current boundaries because: * Government officials made agreements with New York * Connecticut fought for control of Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania during the Pennamite Wars against Pennsylvania * United States Congress got involved in setting borders after the Pennamite Wars * Connecticut had to give up and sell the Western Reserve lands ==Related pages== * List of counties in Connecticut * List of hurricanes in Connecticut * List of rivers of Connecticut * Connecticut Colony ==References== ==Other websites== * [http://www.ct.gov/ www.ct.gov] * [https://web.archive.org/web/20000229204326/http://www.tourism.state.ct.us/ www.tourism.state.ct.us] Category:Connecticut Category:1788 establishments in the United States
