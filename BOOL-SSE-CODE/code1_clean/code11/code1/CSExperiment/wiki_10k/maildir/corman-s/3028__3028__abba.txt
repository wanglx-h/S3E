Frida and Agnetha were both solo singers. Benny and Bjorn both had their own individual bands. In 1966, Benny and Bjorn both met and decided to write songs together. In 1969, Bjorn met Agnetha and Benny met Frida. All four friends met together and decided to work together to record songs. By 1970, they were known as "Bjorn & Benny (With Svenska Flicka)".Meaning "Bjorn & Benny (With Swedish Girls) Later they were called Bjorn & Benny, Agnetha & Frida. Their first hit was a song called "Hej, gamle man".Meaning "Hey, old man". By 1971, Bjorn and Agnetha were married and Benny and Frida were engaged. It wasn't until 1973 that the group became officially known as ABBA. The name was suggested by their manager, Stig Anderson. === Melodifestivalen and Eurovision === "Ring Ring" in 1973 was when the group achieved success throughout much of Europe and Africa. They entered the Swedish song contest Melodifestivalen in 1973 and finished in third place. They returned to Melodifestivalen the next year with "Waterloo (ABBA song)" and won. This gave them the chance to perform in the Eurovision Song Contest. With "Waterloo", they won and soon got global success. === Global career === In 1976, ABBA released "Dancing Queen", which is often known as ABBA's "signature song" and "one of the greatest pop songs ever written". During 1977, their huge popularity became known as "Abbamania". In Australia, ABBA played in huge concerts that usually always sold out. "ABBA: The Movie" was also released in 1977 during the height of the group's popularity. Throughout the mid and late 1970's ABBA performed in Europe, The United States, Japan and Australia. In early 1979, Agnetha and Bjorn divorced. In early 1981, Frida and Benny also got divorced. This led to many sadder and more mature songs over the next few years. By 1981, ABBA's popularity was declining. Their last album, "The Visitors" a not a big success like previous albums. "The Day Before You Came" was the last song ABBA ever recorded together, while "Under Attack" was the last song ever released, both in 1982. ABBA broke up shortly before 1983 and all members continued on their independent music careers, just like before they had met. === Legacy === File:ABBA Voyage (2022).jpg]] Even though they split up, they have remained very popular and many of their songs are still listened to by many people.
