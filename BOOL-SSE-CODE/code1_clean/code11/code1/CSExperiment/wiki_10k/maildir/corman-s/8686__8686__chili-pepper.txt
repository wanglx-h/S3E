Image:Cubanelle Peppers.jpg '''Chili pepper''' is the fruit of a series of plants called Capsicum (nightshade family). Chilis are now grown all over the world, but originally, they came from Mexico. They are used as spices or as vegetables, and also have some use in medicine. Chili peppers are completely unrelated to the ''Piperaceae'' genus, which Black pepper is from. ==History== File:Prehispanic chili pots journal.pone.0079013.g008.pngChili peppers have been a part of the human diet in the Americas since at least 7500 BCE. Chili peppers were domesticated over 6000 years ago in Mexico. Since then, chili peppers could be farmed throughout all of Mexico, Central America, and parts of South America. ==Spelling== The word "chili" is spelled differently in different countries.
