'''CONMEBOL''' or '''CSF''' ('''CON'''federación Suda'''ME'''ricana de Fút'''BOL''' in Spanish language, '''CON'''federação Sul-A'''ME'''ricana de Fute'''BOL''' in Portuguese language; ''South American Football Confederation'') is the governing body of Association football in most of South America. Three countries or territories on the South American mainland—the independent countries of Guyana and Suriname, plus the France overseas department of French Guiana—are not CONMEBOL members. Instead, for cultural and competitive reasons, they are members of CONCACAF, the governing body for the rest of the Americas. ==Related pages== * Copa América, the CONMEBOL championship for men's national teams * Copa Libertadores, the main CONMEBOL club championship * Copa Sudamericana, second major CONMEBOL club championship == Other websites == * [http://www.conmebol.com/ CONMEBOL homepage] Category:CONMEBOL
