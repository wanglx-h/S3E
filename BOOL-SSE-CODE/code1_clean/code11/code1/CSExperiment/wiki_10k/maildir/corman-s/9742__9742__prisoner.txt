People who are suspected of a crime, for example, a murder, may be arrested and held in jail so they will not escape before their trial. After conviction a prisoner may be punished. For example, they may be imprisoned for a fixed number of years, or receive a life imprisonment meaning they stay in jail until they die. A prisoner of war is a person who was captured by the enemy in a war. Category:Prisoners
