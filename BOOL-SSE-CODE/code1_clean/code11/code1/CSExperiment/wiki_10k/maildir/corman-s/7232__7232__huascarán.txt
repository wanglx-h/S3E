The mountain is located in the Ancash Region of Peru. Huascarán has turned into a tourism attraction for mountain climbers. Huascarán is made of granite brought to the surface by a major Fault (geology). It has been staying at about the same elevation, but keeps loosing ice. As recently as 1970, the 1970 Ancash Earthquake caused a big part of the mountain to crumble and fall off. That part of the mountain was all Rock (geology) and ice, and it killed almost 17,000 wikt:people in small towns around the mountain. == Related pages == * List of mountains in the Andes * Fault (geology) == References == Category:Andes Category:Volcanoes of South America Category:Mountains of Peru Category:Ancash Region
