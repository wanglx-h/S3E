File:Magnesium.jpg '''Magnesium''' ( /mæɡˈniːziəm/ mag-NEE-zee-əm) is a chemical element. It has the symbol ''Mg'', atomic number 12 and common oxidation state +2. It is an alkaline earth metal and the eighth most Abundance of chemical elements Chemical element in the Earth's crust. It makes up 2% of the mass of the crust. It is the ninth most common element in the Observable universe universe.. This is because it is easily built up in supernova stars by addition of three helium nucleus (physics) to carbon (which in turn is made from three helium nuclei). Magnesium ion's high solubility in water helps ensure that it is the third most abundant element dissolved in seawater. Magnesium is the 11th most abundant element by mass in the human body. Its ions are essential to all living Cell. The ions play a major role in manipulating important biological polyphosphate compounds like Adenosine triphosphate, DNA, and RNA. Hundreds of enzymes thus require magnesium ions to function. Magnesium is also the metallic ion at the center of chlorophyll. It is a common additive to fertilizers. Magnesium ions are sour to the taste, and in low concentrations help to impart a natural tartness to fresh mineral waters. The free element (metal) is not found naturally on Earth, as it is highly Reactivity (chemistry) (though once produced, it is coated in a thin layer of oxide (see Passivation (chemistry)), which partly masks this reactivity). The free metal burns with a brilliant white light, making it a useful ingredient in Flare. The metal is now mainly obtained by electrolysis of magnesium salts obtained from brine. ==Uses== Commerce, the main use for the metal is as an alloying agent to make aluminium-magnesium Alloy, sometimes called "magnalium" or "magnelium". Since magnesium is less dense than aluminium, these alloys are prized for their relative lightness and strength. Magnesium is used in Firework to make a brilliant bright light. Another use is to mix it with other metals to make it strong, lightweight alloys such as those used to make bicycle frames. Magnesium compounds are used Medicine as common laxatives, Antacid (i.e. milk of magnesia), and where Stability of abnormal nerve excitation and blood vessel spasm is required (that is, to treat eclampsia). Magnesium is used in Electronics Electronic component, including: mobile phones, laptop computers, cameras, and other electronic components. Magnesium's low weight, good mechanical and electrical properties are good for these uses. Magnesium reacted with an alkyl halide gives a Gringard reagent, which is a very useful tool for preparing alcohols. Magnesium is also used in Incendiary device bombs, which are bombs that blow up and spread fire everywhere. == Forms == === Alloys === File:Cold_rolling_of_Mg_and_Mg-1Al-0.1Ca.jpg when its thickness is reduced by only 10% by cold rolling (top). However, after alloying Mg with 1% Al and 0.1% Ca, its thickness could be reduced by 54% using the same process (bottom).]] As of 2013, Magnesium alloy was used less than one million Metric ton per year. This was a lot less than Aluminium alloy. In the same year, 50 million tonnes of Aluminium alloy were used. Using magnesium alloys have limited. This is because magnesium alloys can Corrosion, Creep (deformation) at high Temperature, and Combustion. === Compounds === Magnesium can makes many different Magnesium compounds. They are important in industry and biology. Some common magnesium compounds are magnesium carbonate, magnesium chloride, magnesium citrate, magnesium hydroxide, magnesium oxide, magnesium sulfate, and magnesium sulfate heptahydrate (Epsom salts). === Isotopes === Magnesium has three stable Isotope. These isotopes are , and . All of these isotopes are very common in nature. About 79% of Mg is . The isotope is Radioactive decay. In the 1950s to 1970s, many Nuclear power plant made for Experiment. This isotope has a fairly short Half-life (element) of 21 hours. == Safety == Magnesium burns at a very high temperature, and cannot be put out with water or an ordinary fire extinguisher. It must be extinguished with a class D fire extinguisher. Burning magnesium also produces ultraviolet radiation, which can harm the eyes if it is viewed directly. ==Related pages== * Periodic table * List of common elements ==References== Category:Magnesium
