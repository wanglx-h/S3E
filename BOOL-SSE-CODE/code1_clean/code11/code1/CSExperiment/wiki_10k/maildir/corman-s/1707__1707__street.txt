File:Lombard street.jpg File:Merida-street.jpg :''See also Street (town)'' A '''street''' is a piece of land, made flat and often with pavement, so that people can travel on it better. "Street" and "road" may mean the same thing, but "street" is more often used only in a town. Many streets are the center of local culture or of a specialized activity. New Orleans’ Bourbon Street, for example, is famous for its active nightlife and also for its role as the center of the city’s French Quarter. The Bowery in Manhattan was, at different times, a main highway, a center of underground punk culture, and a specialized shopping district for light fixtures. ==Related pages== * Avenue * Boulevard * Road Category:Basic English 850 words Category:Roads
