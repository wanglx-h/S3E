''Latin Politics, Global Media''. 2002, p. 154 In 2016, Fujimori's head of Intelligence agency, Vladimiro Montesinos, [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-37494079 was convicted for the force disappearances of a professor and two students in 1993]. Many people accused Fujimori of being complicit due to his having direct control of the military, led by Montesinos. After that, Fujimori went to Japan, as his Japanese ancestry had allowed him citizenship there. Japan protected him from Peruvian law since they do not find any valid accusation. Fujimori resigned the Presidency of Peru. Valentín Paniagua was election president by the Congress soon after Fujimori resigned.
