'''Ribosomes''' are important cell organelle. They are Molecular machine that make Protein. They do this through RNA translation, building proteins from amino acids using messenger RNA as a template. Ribosomes are found in all living cells, prokaryotes as well as eukaryotes. Ribosomes are made of two parts: the large and small subunits. Each subunit is made of a mixture of protein and rRNA that are made in the nucleolus of a cell. After being made, ribosomes move from the nuclear envelope to the cytoplasm. Most ribosomes sit on the endoplasmic reticulum, but are also found throughout the cytoplasm. Human cells can have up to 10 million ribosomes in every cell. In order to create each ribosome, cells have many copies of rRNA Gene. In humans, about 400 rRNA genes are Inheritance across five Chromosome.Carey, Nessa 2015.

Each subunit is composed of one or more ribosomal RNA (rRNA) molecules and a variety of proteins. Eukaryotes have 80S ribosomes, each consisting of a small (40S) and large (60S) subunit.The unit of measurement is the Svedberg unit, a measure of the rate of sedimentation in centrifugal force rather than size. This accounts for why fragment numbers do not add up (80S is made of 40S and 60S). Their small subunit has a 16S RNA sub-unit (consisting of 1540 nucleotides) bound to 21 proteins. The large subunit has a 5S RNA (120 nucleotides), a 28S RNA (4700 nucleotides), a 5.8S RNA (160 nucleotides) subunits and 46 proteins.Alberts, Bruce ''et al'' 2002. ''The molecular biology of the cell''. 4th ed, Garland Science, 342. == Types of ribosome == Ribosomes evolved as cells evolved. Prokaryote (bacterial) ribosomes have just a single RNA chain. Archaeal ribosomes are similar. Only Eukaryotic ribosomes have the full gear, which is a total 80S ribosome with a small 40S unit plus a large 60S subunit. == References == Category:Organelles
