Dalton's theory of atoms was based on actual observation. Ideas about atoms were based on philosophy before John Dalton came up with his theory. His theory stated that: *Atoms cannot be divided *Everything is made of atoms *Atoms can not be made or destroyed, just as energy *Atoms are tiny particles *Law of definite composition *Atoms of the same element are the same, because they have the same atomic mass *Chemical reaction are made when atoms are moved around, put with other atoms or taken away from a group of other atoms == Further readings == * Claus Bernet: John Dalton (1766-1844), in: Biographisches-bibliographisches Kirchenlexikon, 31, 2010, 309-332. == References == == Other websites == * [http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/John_Dalton John Dalton] -Citizendium Category:1766 births Category:1844 deaths Category:English chemists Category:English physicists Category:British nuclear physicists
