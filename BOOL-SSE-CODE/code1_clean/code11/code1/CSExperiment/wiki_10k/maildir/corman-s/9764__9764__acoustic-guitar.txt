Once you pluck a string or strum a chord, the vibration of the strings is amplified by the highest of the guitar and thru the soundhole. These marks show where to press a string with the fingers of the left hand, to change the note that string plays. The right hand plucks or strums the strings, either with the fingers or using a plectrum ("pick"), to make them sound. Acoustic guitars are used in types of music ranging from classical music to rock and roll, to bluegrass and folk music. The six strings can be steel or nylon. Nylon strings are typically used for classical and related styles of music. Steel strings are typically used for most other styles. ==How the guitar became a popular instrument== The acoustic guitar came from Spain (an instrument with six strings), created by Antonio Torres Jurado.
