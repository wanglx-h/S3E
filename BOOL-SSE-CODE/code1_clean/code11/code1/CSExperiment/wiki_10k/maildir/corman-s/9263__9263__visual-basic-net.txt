It is sometimes shortened to '''''VB.NET'''''. It is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) and it includes an easy 'drag-and-drop' interface. It can make complete programs for Microsoft Windows very easily. ==Background== ===Visual Basic=== It was first released in 1992 by Microsoft. Visual Basic is a simple way to make programs for Microsoft Windows. It started as ''Project Ruby'' by Alan Cooper and then was sold to Microsoft. The system is built loosely on the original BASIC programming language released in 1963 and it can 'Test' programs in real-time, error checking them in a user-friendly way. ===.NET Framework=== This package is the 'backbone' of Visual Basic .NET. When applications are created, the Microsoft Windows Installer includes the framework with it. It includes all the items needed to run the VB.NET applications that have been made. ==Editions== Visual Basic was first released in May 1991 for Microsoft Windows. Many versions have been released since then. These are listed below: {| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center" |- ! Name !! Operating System !! Date Released |- !

It is aimed at encouraging more newbie programmers to try the series. The program can be downloaded from [http://www.microsoft.com/ Microsoft's Website]. ==Controls== Visual Basic .NET uses many controls which can be added to the forms or windows in the computer program. Other developers can create controls for applications, not just the ones that Microsoft include. ==Examples== The following example makes a program window pop up that says "Hello World" and has a button that says "OK" used to close the window: Public Sub button1_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles button1.Click MsgBox("Hello World") End Sub == Other websites == * [http://vb.net-informations.com VB.NET Step by Step Tutorial] * [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-gb/vstudio/default.aspx Visual Studio .NET Homepage] * [http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/ Visual Studio Express Homepage] Category:Microsoft software Category:IDEs Category:Programming languages
