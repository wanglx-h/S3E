''An Encyclopedic Dictionary of Conflict and Conflict Resolution, 1945-1996'', via Google Books. was a leader of the Soviet Union. Born in 1906, Brezhnev's title was "First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union". He was effectively the dictator of the Soviet Union from 1964 until his death in 1982. During the World War II, Brezhnev was a Political Commissar. He supervised various military units. There, he became a friend of Nikita Khrushchev. Unlike Khrushchev, the leader of the Soviet Union before him, Brezhnev did not agree with the process of destalinization, and did not support reform. Under Brezhnev, the Soviet economy mostly consisted of military spending. Because the country's resources were going to the armed forces, as they had under Joseph Stalin in wartime, consumer wants were ignored. The standard of living began to fall. Brezhnev died of a heart attack on November 10, 1982. At over 18 years, Brezhnev was longest ruling Russian Ruler since Stalin until Vladimir Putin broke this record in 2017. == Related pages == * Death and state funeral of Leonid Brezhnev == References == Category:1906 births Category:1982 deaths Category:Former dictators Category:People of the Vietnam War Category:Recipients of the Order of Lenin Category:Heads of government of the Soviet Union Category:General Secretaries of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union
