'''Engelbert Dollfuss''' (''German'': '''Dollfuß''') (October 4, 1892 – July 25, 1934) was the Chancellor of Austria from 1932 until 1933. He led the country as a dictator from early 1933 until 1934. He studied law in Vienna, and Economics in Berlin. During World War I, he served in the Alps and briefly became a prisoner of war in 1918. He became Chancellor on May 20, 1932 as head of a right-wing coalition government. He wanted to solve the problems caused by the Great Depression. He had problems finding majorities in parliament. The measures he liked to take to deal with inflation were not well liked. In March 1933, he suspended the Austrian parliament. He then governed by decree. With Adolf Hitler as Chancellor in Germany, Dollfuss feared that the influence of the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei would grow. This would then lead to a growth in popularity for its Austrian counterpart. Because of this, he banned the NSDAP in June 1933. He also banned the Sozialdemokarische Arbeiterpartei Osterreichs in February 1934. In September 1933, he formed an umbrella grouping to support the regime, the ''Vaterländische Front'' (Fatherland Front) and merged the Christian Social Party with the para-military Heimwehr (Home Guard), a Nationalism paramilitary group. The regime which was put into power by him and remained in power until 1938 is often called ''Austrofascism''. The form of state he employed was called the ''Ständestaat''. On July 25, 1934, eight Austrian Nazism entered the Chancellery building and gun and killed Dollfuss in an attempted coup d'etat, as a prelude to Anschluss. The Nazis surrendered and were execution. Kurt Schuschnigg became the new dictator of Austria. ==References== == Other websites == * [http://www.aeiou.at/aeiou.film.data.film/f029a.mpg Video: Dollfuß holds a speech in Burgenland 1933 (mpeg, 6,1 kb)] {| align="center" cellpadding="2" border="2" |- | width="30%" align="center" | Preceded by:'''Karl Buresch''' | width="40%" align="center" | '''Chancellor of Austria''' | width="30%" align="center" | Succeeded by:'''Kurt Schuschnigg''' |- |} Category:1892 births Category:1934 deaths Category:Chancellors of Austria Category:Government ministers of Austria Category:Murders by firearm
