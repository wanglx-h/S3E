'''Tyresta National Park''' is a small national park in Sweden. It only has about 50 square kilometre (or 19 square miles) of land. It is located near the capital city of Stockholm. A large fire burned almost 10 percent of the park in 1999, but the animals and plants have come back and are now doing fine. == Other websites == *[http://www.tyresta.se/english.shtml Tyresta National Park and Nature Reserve] Category:National parks in Europe Category:Geography of Sweden
