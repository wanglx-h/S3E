Subject: United States customary units
'''U.S. customary units''' are the main defacto official system of measurement used to measurement things in the United States and Territories of the United States (except in Puerto Rico and Guam, where the metric system is also officially used and is dominant). The system of Imperial units, on which the U.S. customary units are based, is very :wikt:similar but there are some Comparison of the Imperial and US customary systems. Length or distance units include the inch, Foot (unit of length), Yard (unit of length) and mile. Land units include '''square miles''' (2589998.47032 square meter) and '''acres''' (4046.8726 square meter). Common volume units are the '''teaspoon''', '''tablespoon''' (3 teaspoons), '''fluid ounce''' (two tablespoons), '''Cup (unit)''' (8 ounces), '''pint''' (2 cups, or 16 fluid ounces), '''quart''' (2 pints, or 32 fluid ounces), US gallon (16 cups, 128 fluid ounces, or 3.8 litres). A barrel (unit) is the unit to measure oil. Temperature is measured in degrees Fahrenheit (°F). Here is a formula to convert from Celsius to °F: \frac{9}{5}C+32 Units of weight and mass include the '''pound''' (453.6 grams), which contains 16 ounces. This should not be confused with the British pound which is a type of money. The different uses of the word ''pound'' can cause confusion. Different sizes of ounce are also in use. Some people have been trying to replace these units with the SI since the 1820s. Much infrastructure in the United States and British Empire was built in past centuries using the old measures. During the 20th century some sectors such as science, medicine and the military of the United States converted to metric but the majority Americans still primarily use the old units for daily purposes and most government documents list measurements in the US customary system only. On the other hand, world trade is conducted using the metric system and except for the US and Liberia, the world uses the metric system for almost all purposes. == Length == {| class="wikitable" |- ! unit || equal to || Metric |- |1 point (p) || ||0.4mm |- |1 pica (P) || 12 points ||4.2mm |- |1 inch (in) || 6 picas ||2.54cm |- |1 foot (ft) || 12 inches ||30.48cm |- |1 yard (yd) || 3 feet ||0.9144m |- |1 mile (mi) || 1760 yards || 1.609344km |} == Area == {| class="wikitable" |- !
