Black bears usually live in forested areas, but do leave forests in search of food. Sometimes they become wikt:attracted to human activity due to a lack of food. The American black bear is listed by the IUCN as Least Concern, because the species has a large global wikt:population estimated to be twice that of all other bear species combined. In the past century, only 37 people have been killed by these animals. American black bears usually hibernation during winter. During this time, the black bear's metabolism and heart rate both decrease in relation to one another. In fact, during hibernation, an American black bear's heart can stop for twenty seconds. The body temperature of black bears also decreases to 31 °Centigrade (88 °Fahrenheit) during hibernation. When hibernation is over, the black bear's body temperature returns to normal. Black bears are Omnivore (eating both meat and Plant). They feed on fish, Rodent, Rabbit, Insect, carrion, fruit, Nut (fruit), grass, Leaf, honey, deer, and moose calves. Their predators are Human, Grizzly bear, and American alligator, while Wolf, Coyote, Puma, lynx, Fox, Bird of prey, and even other black bears are predators of black bear cubs. ==References== Category:Bears Category:Mammals of North America
