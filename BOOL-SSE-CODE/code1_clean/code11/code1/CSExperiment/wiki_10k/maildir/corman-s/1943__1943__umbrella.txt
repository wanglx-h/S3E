An '''umbrella''' is a hand tool that is used to stop rain from falling on a person. It is also used to make shade and protect people from sunlight. An umbrella made for protection from the sunlight is called a parasol. A plastic umbrella does not cost a lot but can be broken easily. An umbrella,https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/umbrella sometimes referred to as a parasol when used for sun protection, is a portable device designed to shield the user from weather elements such as rain or sunlight. It generally consists of a fabric canopy supported by a frame and a central pole. Umbrellas are widely used for personal protection against rain or to provide shade on hot days. Their portability makes them a convenient accessory, and while most commonly associated with individual use, they have also had applications in architecture and transportation.https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/umbrella ==History== The umbrella's origins stretch back thousands of years, with early forms found in ancient Egypt, Greece, and China. In ancient Egypt, umbrellas were primarily used by royalty to protect against the sun and were often made from materials such as palm fronds and feathers. In Greece and Rome, umbrellas continued to serve mainly as sunshades, although rain protection became more common as time progressed. By the 16th century, umbrellas reached Europe, initially serving as sunshades for women. Over time, however, their role evolved, and umbrellas became more practical for rain protection. During the 17th and 18th centuries, there was significant development in umbrella design. The first umbrellas designed explicitly for rain protection were introduced in Europe. Frames began to be made of more durable materials like steel and whalebone, and by the 18th century, the collapsible umbrella,https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/umbrella which was more portable, became a common invention.https://www.dictionary.com/browse/umbrella ==Design and function== A standard umbrella consists of a fabric or synthetic canopy stretched over a framework of ribs. These ribs are attached to a central pole, which provides structural support. Lightweight materials like fiberglass or metal are used for the ribs, while the canopy is often made of polyester, nylon, or cotton. The folding mechanism, which allows for compact storage, is one of the key features of modern umbrellas. A spring or sliding button mechanism helps the umbrella open and close with minimal effort. Umbrellas also include a handle, which is designed for grip and ease of use. These handles can be made from wood, plastic, rubber, or metal, offering comfort and control during use. ==Types== There are several types of umbrellas,https://www.shabdkosh.com/dictionary/english-hindi/umbrella/umbrella-meaning-in-hindi each designed for specific purposes: * Rain Umbrella: The most common type, designed for protection against rain. It generally features a rounded or dome-shaped canopy and is used frequently in wet weather.https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/umbrella-organization https://most-iconic-art.com/collections/umbrellas * Sun Umbrella (Parasol): These umbrellas are primarily used to provide shade from the sun and to block harmful UV rays. They are typically lighter than rain umbrellas and often feature a wider canopy. * Compact Umbrella: This smaller, more portable version of the traditional umbrella is designed for convenience. It folds into a compact size, making it easy to store in a bag or backpack. * Golf Umbrella: Larger than standard umbrellas, golf umbrellas provide extra coverage, making them ideal for outdoor activities like golfing or hiking, where more protection from wind and rain is necessary.https://historycooperative.org/when-was-the-umbrella-invented/ * Double Umbrella: These umbrellas have a larger canopy and are designed to be shared by two people, making them a popular choice for couples or people needing to stay close during inclement weather. * Windproof Umbrella: Designed to withstand high winds, these umbrellas feature reinforced frames and specialized fabrics to prevent the umbrella from flipping inside out.https://www.researchnester.com/reports/umbrella-market/1919 * Automatic Umbrella: These umbrellas open and close with the push of a button, offering ease of use and convenience, especially when caught in sudden weather changes.https://apparelresources.com/technology-news/manufacturing-tech/umbrella-easy-muse/ ==Materials used in umbrella manufacturing== Umbrellas are typically constructed from materials chosen for their balance of strength, durability, and weight. The frame materials commonly used include: *Steel: Strong and durable, steel is often used for the ribs and shaft of larger umbrellas. However, it can be heavy. *Aluminum: Lighter than steel, aluminum is frequently used for compact umbrellas due to its lightness and resistance to rust. *Fiberglass: Known for its flexibility and strength, fiberglass is often used for ribs and shafts of wind-resistant umbrellas. *Wood: Some umbrellas feature wooden handles or frames, offering a more traditional aesthetic. The canopy material is typically chosen for its water-resistant properties. Common fabrics include: *Nylon: Lightweight, durable, and water-resistant, nylon is a popular choice for umbrellas. *Polyester: A synthetic fabric that resists water and can be treated for UV protection. *Cotton: Though less common, cotton may be used in higher-end umbrellas due to its natural, breathable qualities. In addition, many modern umbrellas feature coatings or treatments to enhance water resistance, UV protection, and wind resistance. ==Cultural significance of umbrellas== Umbrellas have carried cultural significance in various societies throughout history. They have often symbolized status, elegance, or protection. In Japan, the traditional paper umbrella, or wagasa, has been a part of cultural ceremonies like tea ceremonies and festivals, where it serves both practical and symbolic roles, offering protection and care. In Western cultures, umbrellas have often been associated with fashion. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, decorative umbrellas, such as lace parasols, were popular accessories, particularly for women during social events. ==Environmental impact and alternatives== Despite their utility, the environmental impact of umbrellas has raised concerns. Most umbrellas are made with materials that are not biodegradable, and many are discarded once they break, contributing to waste. In response to these concerns, some manufacturers have begun to explore more sustainable designs, using recycled materials for the frame and fabric or creating longer-lasting umbrellas. Alternatives to umbrellas, such as raincoats, ponchos, and waterproof jackets, provide similar protection from rain without requiring the use of a separate item. These alternatives can have a lower environmental impact, especially if made from eco-friendly materials. In conclusion, while the umbrella is often an overlooked object, its long and diverse history, design evolution, and ongoing environmental considerations highlight its continued relevance and importance in daily life. As awareness of sustainability grows, the design and manufacturing of umbrellas are likely to shift toward more eco-friendly and durable practices. == Gallery == Image:Umbrella.png|An ''umbrella''.
