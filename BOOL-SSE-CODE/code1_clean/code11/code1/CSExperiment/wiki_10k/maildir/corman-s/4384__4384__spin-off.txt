Subject: Spin-off
A '''spin-off''' is something new that comes from something already present. If military technology finds civilian use, for example, that is one kind of spin-off. It is often used for video games, movies, and television programmes, but it can also be used when talking about company or organisations. A spin-off may have the same people, places, themes or ideas as the original. ==Spin-offs in television== * ''Frasier'' (spin-off from ''Cheers'') * ''Angel (TV series)'' (spin-off from ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'') * ''The Facts of Life'' (spin-off of ''Diff'rent Strokes'') * ''She-Ra: Princess of Power'' (spin-off from ''He-Man and the Masters of the Universe'') * ''Daria'' (spin-off from ''Beavis and Butthead'', which was a spin-off from ''Liquid Television'') * ''The Simpsons'' (spin-off from ''The Tracey Ullman Show'') * ''Torchwood'' (spin-off from ''Doctor Who'') *''Jack and the Pack'' and ''All Engines Go'' (spin-off from ''Thomas and Friends'') * ''A.N.T.
