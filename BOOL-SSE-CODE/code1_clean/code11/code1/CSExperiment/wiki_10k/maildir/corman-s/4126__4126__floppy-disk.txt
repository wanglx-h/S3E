Subject: Floppy disk
The '''floppy disk''' is a removable magnetism storage medium. Floppy disks are used for moving information between computers, laptops or other devices. Some early digital cameras, electronic music instruments and older computer game consoles use floppy disks. Floppy disks are inserted in to a '''floppy disk drive''' or simply '''floppy drive''' to allow data to be read or stored. Floppy disks store much less Information than a CD-ROM disk or USB flash drive. A normal 3 inch disk can store 1.44 megabytes of data. This is usually enough for simple text documents. A special type of floppy disk was made in the late 1980s. It could store 2.88 megabyte of data. They did not become popular. Larger size floppy disks became available in the 1990s. The two most popular were the Zip drive and the Jaz drive, both made by Iomega. Floppy disk technology has been around since the early 1970s (the 8-inch floppy was the first). Today, floppy disks have been replaced by other storage media, like USB flash drives. Floppy disks and drives are no longer manufactured, but are still widely-available as new old stock. In 2024, authorities in Japan stopped asking people to give documents to the government using floppy disks, because they have been replaced. https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx82407j1v3o.

It is the part of a computer that reads and writes the disk that can be removed. A disk, often called a ''floppy disk'', is used to store files and carry them from one computer to another by using the floppy drive. The floppy drive reads the disk (or diskette) and the user is then able to open and change the Computer file saved on the disk. == Capacities == {| class="wikitable" |+ align="bottom"|''Historical sequence of floppy disk formats, including the last format to be generally adopted — the "1.44 MB" 3½-inch HD floppy, introduced 1987''. |- !align="center" width=28%|Floppy disk format !align="center" width=22%|Year introduced !align="center" width=28%|Storage capacity(kibibyte if not stated) !align="center" width=22%|Marketedcapacity |- |8-inch (read-only) |align="center"|1969 |align="right"|80 |align="right"|← |- |8-inch |align="center"|1972 |align="right"|187.5 |align="right"|1.5 Mbit |- |8-inch |align="center"|1973 |align="right"|256 |align="right"|256 KB |- |8-inch double density |align="center"|1976 |align="right"|500 |align="right"|0.5 MB |- |5-inch |align="center"|1976 |align="right"|223 |align="right"|← |- |8-inch double sided |align="center"|1977 |align="right"|1200 |align="right"|1.2 MB |- |5-inch DD |align="center"|1978 |align="right"|360 |align="right"|360 KB |- |3-inchHP single sided |align="center"|1982 |align="right"|280 |align="right"|264 KB |- |3-inch |align="center"|1982to be confirmed |align="right"|360to be confirmed |align="right"|← |- |3-inch (DD at release) |align="center"|1984 |align="right"|720 |align="right"|720 KB |- |5-inch QD |align="center"|1984 |align="right"|1200 |align="right"|1.2 MB |- |3-inch DD |align="center"|1984to be confirmed |align="right"|720to be confirmed |align="right"|← |- |3-inchMitsumi Quick Disk |align="center"|1985 |align="right"|128 to 256 |align="right"|← |- |2-inch |align="center"|1985to be confirmed |align="right"|720to be confirmed |align="right"|← |- |5-inch Perpendicular |align="center"|1986to be confirmed |align="right"|100 mebibyte |align="right"|← |- |3-inch HD |align="center"|1987 |align="right"|1440 |align="right"|1.44 MB |- |3-inch ED |align="center"|1991 |align="right"|2880 |align="right"|2.88 MB |- |3-inch LS-120 |align="center"|1996 |align="right"|120.375 mebibyte |align="right"|120 MB |- |3-inch LS-240 |align="center"|1997 |align="right"|240.75 MiB |align="right"|240 MB |- |3-inch HiFD |align="center"|1998/99 |align="right"|150/200 MiBto be confirmed |align="right"|150/200 MB |- |colspan=4 align="center"|Acronyms:'''DD''' = Double Density; '''QD''' = Quad Density; '''HD''' = High Density '''ED''' = Extra-high Density; '''LS''' = Laser Servo; '''HiFD''' = High capacity Floppy Disk |- |colspan=4 align="left"|Dates and capacities marked to be confirmed are of unclear origin and need source information; other listed capacities refer to: * For 8-inch: standard IBM formats as used by the System/370 mainframes and newer systems * For 5- and 3-inch: standard PC formats, capacities quoted are the total size of all sectors on the disk and include space used for the bootsector and filesystem Other formats may get more or less capacity from the same drives and disks. |} ==References == Category:Storage devices
