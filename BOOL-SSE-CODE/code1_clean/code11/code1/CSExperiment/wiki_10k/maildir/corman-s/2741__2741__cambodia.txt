Savanna grassland occur in the plains, with the grasses reaching a height of 5feet (1.5metres). In the eastern highlands the high plateaus are covered with grasses and deciduous forests. Broad-leaved evergreen forests grow in the mountainous areas to the north, with trees 100feet (30metres) high emerging from thick undergrowths of vines, rattans, palms, bamboos, and assorted woody and herbaceous ground plants. In the southwestern highlands, open forests of pines are found at the higher elevations, while the rain-drenched seaward slopes are blanketed with virgin rainforests growing to heights of 150feet (45metres) or more. Vegetation along the coastal strip ranges from evergreen forests to nearly impenetrable mangroves. ==Related pages== * Cambodia at the Olympics * Cambodia national football team * List of rivers of Cambodia ==References== == Other websites == * [http://annamap.com/cambodia/ Map of Cambodia with new provinces] Category:Cambodia Category:Current monarchies Category:Least developed countries Category:1953 establishments in Asia
