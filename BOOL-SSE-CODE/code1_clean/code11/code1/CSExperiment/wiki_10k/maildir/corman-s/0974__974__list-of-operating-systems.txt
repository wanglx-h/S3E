Subject: List of operating systems
This is a '''list of operating systems''' for computers. ==The first operating systems== *CTSS (The Compatible TimeShare System, made at Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Corbato and others) *Incompatible Timesharing System (The Incompatible Timeshare System, made at Massachusetts Institute of Technology) *Multics (project by Bell Labs, General Electric, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology) *Master programme for Leo I in 1962 *THE (operating system) (by Edsger Dijkstra and others) ===The first proprietary computer operating systems=== *Apple DOS (first Software versioning was firmware with Integer BASIC; later Software versioning had BASIC) *Business Operating System (BOS) - Cross-platform, Command Line Interface *Commodore PET, Commodore 64, and Commodore VIC-20, *First IBM PC had 3 OSes to start, UCSD P-system, CPM-86, PC-DOS *FLEX (by TSC for Motorola 6800 based computers: SWTPC, Tano, Smoke Signal Broadcasting, Gimix, etc.) *FLEX9 (by TSC for Motorola 6809 based micros) *mini-FLEX (by TSC for Floppy disk on 6800 based machines) *Sinclair Research Micro and QX, etc. *TRS-DOS, ROM OS's (largely BASIC Open source with file system Software extension) *TI99-4 ===Unix-like and other POSIX-ready systems=== *AIX operating system (UNIX from International Business Machines) *Amoeba distributed operating system (Research Operating System by Andrew S.
