His father, Elias Disney, had Irish-Canadian ancestry and his mother, Flora Call Disney, had German and English ancestry. His great-grandfather, Arundel Elias Disney, had emigrated from Gowran, County Kilkenny, Ireland where he was born in 1801. Arundel Disney was a descendant of Robert d'Isigny-sur-Mer, a Frenchman who had traveled to England with William the Conqueror in 1066. The d'Isigny name was anglicisation as "Disney" and the family settled in a village now known as Norton Disney, south of the city of Lincoln, Lincolnshire, in the county of Lincolnshire. ==Career== About the time Disney was entering high school, his family moved to the city of Chicago. Disney took classes at the Chicago Art Institute and drew for the school newspaper. When he was sixteen, Disney decided he wanted to help fight in World War I. Since he was still too young to join the army, he dropped out of school and joined the Red Cross. He spent the next year driving ambulances for the Red Cross in France. Disney's best-known creation is the animated cartoon character, Mickey Mouse. Disney even provided the voice for Mickey Mouse for many years. Donald Duck is another famous creation. Minnie Mouse and Pluto (dog) are also his creations. Disney was once fired from a newspaper company in Kansas City, Missouri because of his lack of creativity. Disney began as a cartoonist in the 1900s. He created Oswald the Lucky Rabbit but lost ownership of the character due to a contract problem. He then created Mickey Mouse. Disney started the Walt Disney Studios and created the first full-length animated movie when he created Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 movie) (1937). The movie was a huge success. The money from the movie helped Disney create many more cartoons and movies such as ''Fantasia (movie), Pinocchio (1940 movie)'' (both 1940)'', Dumbo'' (1941), and ''Bambi'' (1942). New animated and live-action films followed after World War II, including the critically successful ''Cinderella (1950 movie)'' (1950), ''Peter Pan (1953 movie)'' (1953), and ''Mary Poppins (movie)'' (1964), the latter of which received five Academy Awards. He earned 32 academy awards. Disney once refused an offer from Alfred Hitchcock to make a movie at Disney World after Hitchcock filmed ''Psycho (1960 movie)''. He also served as the host of The Wonderful World of Disney, a weekly variety show that had Disney cartoons and some live-action skits. In the 1950s, Disney created Disneyland in Anaheim, California. Disneyland was the first modern theme park. Disney also bought the land for Walt Disney World Resort in Florida. Disney did not see Walt Disney World finished though because he died before it opened. Both Disneyland and Walt Disney World (and now other Disney theme parks) are famous for their design, level of detail, being very clean, and animatronics.
