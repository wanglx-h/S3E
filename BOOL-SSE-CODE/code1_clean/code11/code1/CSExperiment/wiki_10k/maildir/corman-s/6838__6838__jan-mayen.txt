File:Beerenberg Jan Mayen.JPG Image:Jan Mayen FBOI2005.gif '''Jan Mayen''' is an island in the Arctic Ocean. It is part of Norway. The island's area is 373km². A large part of the island is an active volcano, the Beerenberg, which is 2,277m high. Jan Mayen is 600km north of Iceland, 500km east of Greenland and 1000km west of the Norway mainland.[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/jn.html "Jan Mayen" at ''CIA World Factbook''] ; excerpt, "no indigenous inhabitants"; retrieved 2013-4-19. There is a radio station and a Meteorology station on the island. The staff at these stations are the only people living on the island. ==History== There are many claims and stories about discovery of the island. Some claims and possible discoveries are as early as the beginning of the 6th century. However, the first discovery that is certain was in 1614. The Dutchman Jan Jacobs May van Schellinkhout visited the island then and it is named for him. His first mate made maps of some of the coast. It is incorrectly assumed that Henry Hudson discovered the island in 1607 and called it ''Hudson's Tutches'' or ''Touches'', but there is no evidence for this. Thereafter it was allegedly seen several times by navigators who claimed its discovery and renamed it. Thus, in 1611 or the following year whalers from Kingston upon Hull named it ''Trinity Island''; in 1612 Jean Vrolicq, a French people whaler, claimed in 1629 that he had discovered the island and called it ''Île de Richelieu;'' and in 1614 English captain John Clarke named it Isabella. The island has very few residents. The LORAN (Loran-C) base has a staff of 14 and a weather services station has a staff of four. The staff members of both stations live in Olonkinbyen. The island has no native people living on it, but is given the ISO 3166-1 country code SJ, the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) .no (.sj is [http://www.norid.no/domenenavnbaser/bv-sj.html allocated but not used] ) and data code JN. Its amateur radio call sign prefix is JX. ==Related pages== * Svalbard ==References== ==Other websites== *[http://home.online.no/~vteigen/satt.html Satellite Radar image of Jan Mayen] *[warning from Norway's last outpost] https://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/i/l3k8yA/jan-mayen-utposten-som-varmes-opp. 2023-10-09.
