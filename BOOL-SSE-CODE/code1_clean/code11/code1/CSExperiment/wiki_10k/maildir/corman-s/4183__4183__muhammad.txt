Many earlier (primarily non-Islamic) traditions refer to him as still alive at the time of the Muslim conquest of the Levant#Conquest of Palestine. See Stephen J. Shoemaker,''The Death of a Prophet: The End of Muhammad's Life and the Beginnings of Islam,'' page 248, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2011. Muhammad was born in Mecca, Hejaz. In 610 Anno Domini, at the age of forty, while Muhammad was Prayer, he reportedly met Gabriel and received the first revelation of the Qur'an. At first, Muhammad preached these revelations to his close friends and family. Then he started preaching monotheism publicly, and received opposition from Mecca Polytheism. He was eventually forced to leave his hometown of Mecca. After reaching Medina with Abu Bakr, the Medinan Muslims helped Muhammad and built a Al-Masjid al-Nabawi there. == Life == === Childhood === Muhammad was born about 570 AD in Mecca. His father, whose name was Abdullah, died six months before Muhammad's birth. His mother, Amina, died when he was six years old. After that, his grandfather, Abd al-Muttalib, took care of him, but he too died two years later when Muhammad was nine. After his grandfather's death, his uncle Abu Talib took care of him. When he was young, Muhammad accompanied his uncle on trade trips. Abu Talib remained a good support to him for many years of his adult life. === Beginning of the prophethood === In 610 AD, when Muhammad was forty years old, he went for a walk to the mountain of Hira near Mecca. According to Muslims, the angel Gabriel (called Jibril in the Arabic language) spoke with him in a cave on the mountain. The story says that when Muhammad first saw the angel Gabriel, he Syncope because Gabriel was so large. This is what Gabriel said to Muhammad: File:Cave Hira.jpg "Read... in the name of Allah Who made man from a drop of blood... Allah is Most Rewarding... He Who taught man to write with pen... and taught man what he knew not."This saying can be found in the Qu'ran (Chapter 96:1 - 5) Muhammad went back home to his wife Khadijah and told her what had happened. New revelations came to him commanding him to preach what was being sent ''down'' from God. When Muhammad first started teaching, many of the people of Mecca, who Idolatry, did not like the things that Muhammad said. But there were also people who listened to his preaching and obeyed his messages. These people were the first of the followers of Islam. Leaders of Mecca Religious persecution and Torture the followers of Islam. Some followers of Islam were Execution. Muhammad resisted this and continued to teach Islam. == The Hijrah == After Muhammad finished his work in Mecca, he took his message to Medina, where some people learned about him and his followers. They welcomed him into their city, and Muhammad wanted them to Religious conversion to Islam. They agreed, and many of his followers went to Medina. This movement from Mecca to Medina is called the ''Hijrah (Islam)''. The Hijra was also the beginning of the Islamic calendar. Muhammad stayed behind until all of his people left Mecca safely. As Muhammad stayed in Mecca, his uncle Abu Lahab trained seven men to kill Muhammad in his sleep. According to history, they did not see him leave Mecca. The men went into his house and found his cousin, Ali. Abu Lahab and his horsemen went to the desert to look for him and his friend, Abu Bakr. == His stay in Medina == Muhammad and Abu Bakr arrived in Medina. Some people welcomed Muhammad to their homes. He used his camel to show everyone where he would build his house. The first mosque of Medina, a small place for prayer, was built in the back of this house. The people in a strong Jewish tribe in Medina disagreed with Muhammad's teachings and rules. This tribe told their Alliance in Mecca to sell all the things and homes that Muslims of Mecca left behind. The Muslims and those from Mecca were advised to fight for their property. Muhammad told them not to do that. Muslims were called all over Medina to gather at a mosque that Muhammad prayed in. They were told to fight against the people of Mecca who Arson and Theft. == The wars == The Quraysh Paganism of Mecca heard about this, and they sent a larger army numbering 1000 warriors to fight the Muslims. They met in Battle of Badr, but the pagans were defeated and Abu Jahl, one of the pagan leaders, was also killed. However, the Muslims lost the second battle at Battle of Uhud. One year after the fight at Badr, the army of Mecca had outside help. Muslim Archery failed to listen to Muhammad's instructions and Khalid ibn al-Walid cleverly took advantage of that. Hamza, Muhammad's last uncle, was killed when a Slavery from Mecca threw a spear into his chest. Muhammad himself was injured. Then in 627, Abu Sufyan led the Quraysh and its allies to attack Medina itself. However, they could not pass the ditch that the Muslims had dug around Medina. After several weeks, the coalition broke up and went home. The Medinians were considered victors. == The truce with Mecca == After the pagans of Mecca failed to gain control of Medina, the Muslims became stronger. The pagans then decided to sign a Ceasefire with the Muslims where they promised not to fight each other for ten years. The Muslims used this as a chance to talk to other people all over Arabia. In three years, many people changed their religions to Islam. However, this truce did not last for long. After three years of the truce, a small group of horsemen from Mecca attacked a Muslim camp and killed a few of them. The Muslims in Medina heard of this, and the truce was cancelled. Abu Sufyan, the third leader of Mecca in Muhammad's lifetime, tried to resume the truce, but Muhammad politely refused the offer. Muhammad told his followers to be ready to capture Mecca. After Mecca was captured, they went on to capture the Torkan. == The capture of Mecca == In 630, most people in Arabian Peninsula had become Muslims, and they became part of Muhammad's large army to capture Mecca. The people of Mecca were afraid to fight back because the army was so big. Abu Sufyan, who was unhappy over the broken truce, went to Muhammad's camp outside Mecca to ask for forgiveness. Muhammad did not say that he would forgive him, so he returned home. While he was with Muhammad, he changed his religion to Islam by saying the Testimony (ash-Ashaada): "I testify that there is no other god but Allah, and I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah." The next day, the Muslim army walked towards Mecca. Everyone ran to their homes and closed all doors and windows. They were afraid that the Muslims were going to kill them, because of the bad things they did to the Muslims many years ago. But, the Muslims went towards the Ka'aba, believed to be built by Abraham and his elder son, Ishmael. Bilal ibn Ribah, a former Ethiopian slave, shouted out loud to the people of Mecca that they were all safe: "All those who lay down arms are safe. All those in the house of Abu Sufyan are safe. All those behind closed doors are safe." Abu Sufyan heard this in his home. From this, he learns that Muhammad forgave him. At that time, Muhammad and his followers removed and broke all idols from the Kaaba. The idols were statues that were Worship as gods. Muhammad forgave all citizens of Mecca. In the end, Bilal climbed to the top of the Kaaba and called for prayer. This was Muhammad's victory in spreading Islam all over Arabia. But, because he was old, he would not live for long. == His death == File:Mescidi nebevi.JPG in Medina. Muhammad is believed to be buried at the building with the green dome. It used to be his home when he was alive.]] In 632 AD, on June 8, Muhammad became very sick. Before he died, he told his followers about his death. He is buried in the chamber of his wife Aisha in Medina, where the Masjid al-Nabawi (Mosque of the Prophet) is. In Medina, his friend Abu Bakr went to the Masjid al-Nabawi and shouted to the people: "If any of you worship Muhammad, you should know that Muhammad is dead. But those of you who worship Allah(SWT) (God), let it be known that Allah(SWT) (God) is alive and cannot die."Muhammad’s Biography, [http://www.islamreligion.com/articles/180/ The Religion of Islam]. Found January 23, 2007 Although Muhammad died, Islam soon spread all over the Middle East. Then, centuries later, it continued till it reached Africa, Asia and Europe. Islam has become one of the biggest and fastest-growing World religions. ==Relations== When Muslims say or write the name of Muhammad, they usually follow it with ''"Peace and Blessing be upon him"'' (Arabic: ''sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam''). For example, "Muhammad (Peace and Blessings be upon him)".Ann Goldman, Richard Hain, Stephen Liben (2006), p.212 In printed matter, a Islamic calligraphy symbol is frequently used instead of printing the phrase. Sunni Islam believe that Abu Bakr succeeded Muhammad. Shia Islam believe that Ali should have succeeded. == Images of Muhammad == File:Maome.jpg's ''The Remaining Signs of Past Centuries'', depicting Muhammad Islamic calendar#Prohibiting Nasīʾ during the Farewell Pilgrimage, 17th-century Ottoman copy of a 14th-century (Ilkhanate) manuscript (Edinburgh codex)]] Muslims usually do not make or show images (like paintings or drawings) of Muhammad. For this reason, mosques do not contain paintings or sculptures of Muhammad. Instead, they use abstract art, architecture, and Islamic calligraphy for decoration. The Qur'an does not say that Muslims must never make images of Muhammad. However, it does contain passages that forbid the creation of idols. The Hadith also includes passages that forbid Muslims from creating images of God. As a consequence, Muslims (especially Sunni Muslims) believe there should be no pictures of Muhammad. When people create images of Muhammad, some Muslims may view this as disrespectful, offensive, and emotionally injurious. Much of knowledge about the Life of Muhammad is based on narrations.
