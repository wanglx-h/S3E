There are three genus of geese: the genus ''Anser'', the genus ''Branta'', and the genus ''Chen (biology)''. This family also includes the swans, which are mostly larger than geese, and the ducks, which are smaller and have short necks. Geese are famously gregarious: they like to stick together. They can be moved in large herds because of this feature of their behaviour. Both as chicks and as adults, geese show collective animal behaviour. Geese migration in groups in the spring and fall, flying together in a V-shape. A male goose is called a "gander" and a baby goose is called a "gosling". A group of geese is called a "gaggle". == Related pages == *Bar-headed goose *Canada goose *Magellan goose *Barnacle goose *Pink-footed goose *Swan goose *Chinese goose ==References== Category:Geese Category:Poultry
