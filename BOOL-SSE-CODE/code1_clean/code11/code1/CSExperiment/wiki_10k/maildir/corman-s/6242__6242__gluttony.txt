File:Georg Emanuel Opiz Der Völler 1804.jpg from 1804]] '''Gluttony''' is a wasting of resources. Usually it is food that is wasted. Either one person eats too much, or the person does something so the food (or the resources) do not reach those who need it. In Christianity, this is considered to be one of the Seven deadly sins.
