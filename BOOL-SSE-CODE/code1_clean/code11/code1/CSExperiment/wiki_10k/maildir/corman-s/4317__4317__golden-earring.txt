From 1992 to 2004 the band released three acoustic music live "unplugged" albums which were successful. Since 1992, the band has performed popular acoustic unplugged theater-shows.

George Kooymans, the band's vocalist and guitarist, wrote "Twilight Zone". It was released in 1982 and brought Golden Earring more success. This song also had one of the first music videos. It was aired on the new music television channel, MTV, which began in 1981. This helped "Twilight Zone" become a Top Ten hit in the States. The song was inspired by the popular TV series ''The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)''. "When the Lady Smiles", from the album ''News'', was the next international hit in 1984. It became a top hit in Europe and Canada with the help of a music video. It was not as successful in the States.
