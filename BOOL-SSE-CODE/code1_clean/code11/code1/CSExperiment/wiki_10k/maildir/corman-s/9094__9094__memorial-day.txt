File:The March of Time, by Henry Sandham.jpg '''Memorial Day''' is a national holiday in the United States. It is also a U.S. state holiday in many states. The holiday honors military who have died in past wars like World War I and the Korean War. It was founded by United States Army General John A. Logan, who fought in the Civil War and the Mexican–American War. Memorial Day was first held in 1865 after the American Civil War. It was called '''Decoration Day''' at that time. The holiday was first called Memorial Day in 1882, and became a federal holiday in 1967. On June 28, 1968, the United States Congress made a law that said that the official Memorial Day holiday is May 30, but that Memorial Day was to be observed by federal employees as a paid holiday on the last Monday in May. Memorial Day is thought of by many Americans as being the start of summer. Category:May observances
