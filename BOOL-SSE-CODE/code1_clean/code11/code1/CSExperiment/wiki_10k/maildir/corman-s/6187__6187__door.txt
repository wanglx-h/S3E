It is found in houses and other buildings. Doors are also found in cars and cages. The reasons for a door are: * for people, animals, and objects to go through; some doors are for emergencies only (emergency exit) * to keep cold or hot air outside (or inside, such as the door on a refrigerator) * so that people cannot see or hear what happens on the other side (privacy and stopping noise) * so that people do not fall out of the car or other vehicle * so a person can decide who to let in—many doors have a lock == Types of doors == A '''revolving door''' is a group of doors that turn in a circle as a person pushes one. The person can go through, but wind and rain cannot get in. A '''blind door''' is a fake door that is really part of the wall. People use them to make a room look nice.
