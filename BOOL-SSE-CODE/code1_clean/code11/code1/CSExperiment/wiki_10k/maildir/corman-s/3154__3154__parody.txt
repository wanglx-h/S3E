The parody is an imitation of the original, but exaggeration it, showing cliche which have been used, to make the original look ridiculous or to make a comment about an issue affecting society. For example, in a serious Western (genre) movie, the good guys always seem to shoot better and faster than the bad guys. In a Western parody, this might be exaggerated by showing a good guy firing a single shot, and a dozen of the bad guys falling from their horses as a result.

Parodies can be anything from songs to poetry to books to movies. A movie that makes a parody of another movie or several movies at once is a parody movie.
