Image:Hitchhiker-Luxemburg-1977.jpg '''Hitchhiking''' is a way to end travel from place to place in someone else's vehicle.. Usually, a hitchhiker (a person who hitchhikes) will stand at the side of a road and hold his or her thumb in the air waiting for a passing driver to stop and pick them up. This is a sign that he or she wants to go somewhere else. It was a very common way of traveling in Europe in the 1970s until increased vehicle ownership/affordability.. Fears of drivers and hitchhikers alike as depicted in popular culture and media and likely have also contributed to its decline. The legal status of hitchhiking varies by country. == Signaling Methods == In western European countries, raise their arm, extend their thumb and face traffic on the side of the road. This may be paired with a cardboard sign stating their intended direction or destination. == Legal status == The legal status of hitchhiking varies by country and state. Hitchhiking on highways or motorways is illegal in many countries, and some states explicitly ban it. == Community == In recent years, hitchhikers have made efforts to strengthen the community through websites and events such as Hitchwiki, Tramprennen and other events. == Other websites == Image:Autostop invalid attempt.jpg * [http://www.hitchwiki.org/ The Hitchhiker's Guide to Hitchhiking] - a wiki project to collect information about hitchhiking * [http://www.hitch-hiking.org Anhalterfreunde] - Information all about hitchhiking (English and German language) * [http://www.liftershalte.info/ Liftershalte.info] - a worldmap with hitching places. * [http://www.hitchbase.com hitchbase.com] - Database with hitchhing places * [http://abgefahren.hitchbase.com Abgefahren e.V.] - the first German Autostop Society; ideas, tips, projects,..
