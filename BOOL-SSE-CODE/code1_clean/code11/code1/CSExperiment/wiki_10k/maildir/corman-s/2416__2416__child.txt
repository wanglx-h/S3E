A person can be called his or her parent's child, regardless of the person's age. Another word for "child" is "kid". In almost all countries, it is legally required that children be educated either at school or by homeschooling. Small children may go to nursery school, preschool or kindergarten. Playing and using imagination is a beneficial part of child development. But in poor areas, especially in third world, children may be forced to work long and hard and be used for child labor, such as in the poorest areas of India, South America, or Africa. When people marry and one (or both) of them have children with someone else before this marriage, that child is known as a stepchild by the child's stepparent. If both people had children, the children of the other parent are ''stepbrothers'' or ''stepsisters'' of each other. Children with no parents are referred to as Orphan. Children who are adopted and live with non-biological parents are referred to as adoptive (or foster) children. ==Related pages== * Adolescent * Parent * Sibling (a brother or sister) Category:Children Category:Basic English 850 words
