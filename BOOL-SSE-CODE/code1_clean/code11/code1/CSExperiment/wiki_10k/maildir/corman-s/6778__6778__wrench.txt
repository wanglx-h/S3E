File:Gedore No. 7 combination wrenches 6–19 mm.jpg A '''wrench''' (or '''spanner''') is a tool used to provide grip and turn Nut (hardware) and bolts, and similarly shaped objects. In British English, ''spanner'' is the standard term. The most common shapes are called ''open-ended spanner'' and ''ring spanner''. The term ''wrench'' is generally used for tools that turn non-fastening devices (e.g. tap wrench and pipe wrench), or may be used for a monkey wrench – an adjustable spanner. What a wrench or spanner does is to grip. Pulling or pushing the handle to rotate gives mechanical advantage. It applies torque to turn objects – usually rotary fasteners, such as nuts and bolts – or keep them from turning. == Adjustable wrenches == An adjustable spanner, or adjustable wrench, or crescent wrench in American English, is a tool. It may move its jaw to rotate nuts or bolts of different sizes. It was invented by Edwin Beard Budding (1795–1846), who also invented the lawnmower. Category:tools
