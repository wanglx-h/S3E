During the Middle Ages it became a German people city, but before that Wrocław was a Czech Republic city. It was called Breslau for a long time. During the Second World War the city was badly damaged. About 70% of the buildings were damaged. Many of them were rebuilt. After the war, the city became Polish people, and the German citizens were forced to leave. It has been called by its Polish name Wrocław ever since. Johannes Brahms wrote his Academic Festival Overture to thank the University of Breslau in Wrocław. This was for an honorary doctorate he was awarded by the university. == Modern Wrocław == Its population in 2004 was 638,000. There are 10 universities in the city. It is famous for its beautiful historical town square (Polish ''rynek'') and cathedral (large church). In 1997 the Oder River flooded, causing a lot of damage. == Nobel Prize winners from Wrocław == 10 people from Wrocław have won the Nobel Prize.
