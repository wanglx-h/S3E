After the tissue has been perfusion, capillaries widen to become venules and then widen more to become veins, which return blood to the heart.]] A '''capillary''' is a blood vessel. It does not have the muscular/elastic tissue (biological) of other blood vessels. It has a single cell wall to help substances be transported through organisms. Capillaries are small, and smaller than any other blood vessels. They are about 5-10 micrometre big, connect arteries and venules, and enable the moving of water, oxygen, carbon dioxide, as well as many other nutrient and waste chemical between blood and surrounding tissue (biology). == Anatomy == Blood moves from the heart to arteries, which branch and narrow into arterioles, and then branch more into capillaries. At the capillaries, gases, nutrients, and fluids, are exchanged, with the exact nature and direction of the exchange depending on the location of the capillary bed. For instance, blood traveling through capillaries of the systemic circuit releases oxygen and absorbs carbon dioxide, while blood traveling through the pulmonary capillaries absorbs oxygen and releases carbon dioxide. After this exchange, capillaries join and widen to become small veins and then widen more to become veins, which return blood to the heart. The "capillary bed" is the network of capillaries supplying an Organ (anatomy). The more Metabolism active the cells, the more capillaries it will require to supply nutrients and carry away waste products. Metarteriole connect between arterioles and venules and are important in bypassing the flow of blood through the capillaries. True capillaries come from mainly from metarterioles and provide movement between cells and the circulation. The width of 8 μm forces the red blood cells to partly fold into bullet-like shapes in order to bypass them in single file. Precapillary sphincter are rings of smooth muscles at the start of true capillaries that handle blood flow into true capillaries and control blood flow through a body part or area. == Physiology == File:Illu capillary microcirculation.jpg The capillary wall is a one-layer endothelium so thin that gas and other molecules such as oxygen, water, proteins and lipids can pass through them driven by osmotic. Waste items such as carbon dioxide and urea can move back into the blood to be carried away for removal from the body. The capillary bed usually moves no more than 25% of the amount of blood it could contain, although this amount can be increased through auto regulation by making the smooth muscle relax in the arterioles that lead to the capillary bed as well as metarterioles making themselves smaller. The capillaries do not have this smooth muscle in their own wall, and so any change in their diameter is passive. Any signaling molecules they release (such as endothelin for constriction and nitric oxide for dilation) act on the smooth muscle cells in the walls of nearby, larger vessels, e.g. arterioles. Capillary's vascular permeability items can be increased by the release of certain cytokines, such as in an immune response. ==Related pages== *Alveolar-capillary barrier *Blood brain barrier *Capillary action *Hagen-Poiseuille equation == References == tags--> == Other websites == * Category:Blood vessels
