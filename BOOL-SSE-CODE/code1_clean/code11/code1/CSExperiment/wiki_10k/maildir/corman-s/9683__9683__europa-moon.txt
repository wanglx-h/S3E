It is a little smaller than Earth's Moon and it is the sixth-largest moon in the Solar System. Europa's diameter is about 3000 kilometers. It probably has an iron core, and a thin atmosphere of mostly oxygen. The surface is icy and very smooth. There are not a lot of wikt:crater, but there are some cracks and lines. Scientists believe that there is a liquid ocean under the surface, and that it is kept warm by tidal heating.Greenberg, Richard; ''Europa: the ocean moon: search for an alien biosphere'', Springer Praxis Books, 2005 In other words, heat from tidal flexing (Jupiter's strong gravity on Europa) makes it warm. Europa certainly has a lot of water.Chang, Kenneth (12 March 2015). "Suddenly, it seems, water is everywhere in Solar System". The New York Times. Archived from the original on 9 May 2020. Retrieved 13 March 2015. [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/13/science/space/suddenly-it-seems-water-is-everywhere-in-solar-system.html] The moon Europa was found by Simon Marius in December 1609. Galileo Galilei first saw the moon in January 1610 (he did not know Marius had found it). Simon Marius was the one who had the idea of the name 'Europa'. Europa is named after a princess from Greek mythology who became the first queen of Crete. == References == '''Notes''' == Other websites == * [http://stevechallis.net/Europa.php Europa] Category:Jupiter's moons
