Image:AmstradGX4000.jpg The '''GX4000''' was a video game console made by Amstrad in 1990. At first, it was successful. But it did not continue its early success. The GX4000 games could be used with other Amstrad computers. Only 40 games were made for it. Soon it disappeared into the mist of history. These days it is very rare to see one that is still in working condition. Category:Video game consoles de:Amstrad GX4000
