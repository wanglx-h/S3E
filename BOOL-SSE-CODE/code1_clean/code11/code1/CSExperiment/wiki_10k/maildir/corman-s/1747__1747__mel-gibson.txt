In 1995, Gibson received the Academy Award for Best Picture and the Academy Award for Best Director for his work on ''Braveheart''. He later directed and produced The Passion of the Christ in 2004, a Controversy drama regarding Jesus, which was viewed as Antisemitism by many people.

He is of Irish people descent, and the second son of Hutton Gibson, a writer, and Irish-born Anne Patricia (Née Reilly, died 1990).

One of Gibson's younger brothers, Donal, is also an actor. Gibson's first name is derived from St. Mel’s Cathedral, located in his mother's hometown of Longford, Ireland.

Gibson was twelve at the time. The move to his grandmother's native Australia was for Economics reasons, and his father's expectation that the Australian Defence Force would reject his eldest son for the draft during the Vietnam War.
