'''Roman numerals''' are a numeral system that was used by ancient Rome. Numbers in this system use letters from the Latin alphabet. Currently, it uses seven symbols: The Europeans still used Roman numerals even after the fall of the Roman Empire. From the 14th century, the Europeans replaced Roman numerals with Arabic numerals. However, people still use Roman numerals to this day. One place in which they are sometimes seen is on clock faces (the front of a clock). For example, on the clock of Big Ben, the hours from 1 to 12 are written as: '''''' The and can be read as "one less than 5" (4) and "one less than 10" (9). On many clocks that use Roman numerals, however, 4 is written as . There are also Roman numerals for fractions. They represent something over 12, for example, 8/12=S: == Subtraction rule == Instead of writing the same letter four times, a rule for subtraction is used. The letter is written once, then the next largest Roman numeral is written. When a lower number (such as ) appears before a higher one (such as ), the lower number is subtracted from the higher one. For example, 4 is not written as , but instead as , because is (5) minus (1). The same is done for 9 - it is not written as , but instead as , because is (10) minus (1). == Example == It is very easy to write a number as a Roman numeral. Simply subtract the largest possible Roman numeral as many times as possible from the number. This system will result in a valid Roman numeral, but will not take the subtraction rule into account. {| border="0" cellpadding="4" class="centered" |- align="center" | 1 × 1000 || + || 1 × 500 || + || 4 × 100 || + || 1 × 50 || + || 3 × 10 || + || 4 × 1 || = || 1984 |- align="center" | '''M''' || + || '''D''' || + || '''CCCC''' || + || '''L''' || + || '''XXX''' || + || '''IIII''' || = || '''MDCCCCLXXXIIII''' |} Getting the number from the numeral is equally simple, by adding the values of the symbols. In general, the values for 5, 50, and 500 are not subtracted. Here is the same number using the subtraction rule: {| border="0" cellpadding="4" class="centered" |- align="center" | 1 × 1000 || + || (1 × 1000) - (1 × 100) || + || 1 × 50 || + || 3 × 10 || + || (1 × 5) - (1 × 1) || = || 1984 |- align="center" | '''M''' || + || '''CM''' || + || '''L''' || + || '''XXX''' || + || '''IV''' || = || '''MCMLXXXIV''' |} == Special values == === Zero === The number zero has its own Roman numeral, which is '''Ɔ'''. At about 727, Bede or one of his colleagues used the letter '''N''', the abbreviation (short wikt:form) of ''nihil'' (the Latin word for "nothing").C. W. Jones, ed., ''Opera Didascalica'', vol. 123C in ''Corpus Christianorum, Series Latina''. === Fractions === File:Semisse.jpg}} ('''S''') coin.]] The Romans also used Fraction (mathematics). The most common Base (mathematics) for fractions was 1/12, which in Latin is called ''uncia'' (ounce). {| class="wikitable" |- ! Fraction ! Numeral ! Name (:wikt:nominative and :wikt:genitive) !

In this system, an extra '''Ɔ''' means 500, and multiple extra '''Ɔ'''s are used to mean 5,000, 50,000 etc. {| class="wikitable centered" style="text-align:center" |- !

For example: 26.'''XI'''.2014 or '''XI'''.26.2014 = 26 November 2014. *Some video games use Roman numerals to indicate the game position in a series. The most famous examples are Final Fantasy (Final Fantasy VII, Final Fantasy VIII, Final Fantasy X, etc...). * When movies or books are published, the year of publication or year of copyright may be written as a Roman numeral. * When people write about Monarchs or Popes, Patriarchs, or other leading figures, they are sometimes counted with Roman numbers, e.g. Queen Elizabeth II (of England), Pope John Paul II, Pope Benedict XVI, Patriarch Alexius II (of the Russian-Orthodox church) * In France, the Century are sometimes written with Roman numerals ''(example : "XXe siècle" meaning "20th century", XVIIIe siècle = "18th century", etc...)''. * In Poland, roman numerals are used to show the month in dates and as a short method of writing ordinals (i.e. instead of 6th). * Unicode has a code block called Number Forms, which also contains representations of Roman numerals, at the positions U+2160 to U+2188. == Related pages == * Arabic numerals * Greek numerals == References == == Other websites == * [https://www.knowtheromans.co.uk/Categories/SubCatagories/RomanNumerals/ Roman Numerals (Totally Epic Guide) - Know The Romans] * [https://romantonumber.com/ Roman Numeral Converter] Category:Ancient Rome Category:Numerals
