It was an important year in the history of the world. The most important events centred around Spain. Muslim forces were finally expelled (sent away) from Spain. This ended 780 years of Muslim control in Al-Andalus. Jew were also expelled. With the backing of the King of Spain, Christopher Columbus set off on the voyage by which he would discover the "New World", by which was meant the Americas. Fall of Granada: Muhammad XII of Granada, the last Emirate of Granada, surrenders his city to the army of the Catholic Monarchs (Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile) after a long siege. These discoveries and changes made Spain a large empire, not just a country in Europe. == References == Category:1492
