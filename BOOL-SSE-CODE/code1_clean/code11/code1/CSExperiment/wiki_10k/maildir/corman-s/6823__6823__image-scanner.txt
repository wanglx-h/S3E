File:Imagint scanners types 6.svg In computing, an '''image scanner''' is a device used to transfer images or text into a computer. There are special models for scanning Film negatives, or to scan books. In the computer, the signal from the scanner is transferred to a Digital media. This image can then be edited, printed, etc. All scanners have special parts which are used to take a picture from an object. Charge-coupled device or Contact Image sensor parts take the light from the object and change it into a digital signal. The digital signal is then transferred to the computer memory or is read in the scanner's processor. With some software it can be changed to a compressed digital image, like JPEG or PNG. Text printed or written by hand can be changed to ASCII code by an Optical character recognition program. == Types == The main types of scanner *''Desktop scanner'' (flatbed scanner).
