It is done at the Olympic Games, and it has its own world championships. The name means to make figures or patterns on the ice. People skate with music. In figure skating, sometimes women or men skate alone, or they skate in couples. Couples dancing includes ''pairs'' and ice dancing. Pairs skating has jumps, and sometimes the man lifts the woman in the air. These things are not done in ice dancing. In ice dancing, the woman must be held in the man's arms. Another kind of figure skating is synchronized skating done in groups. == History == The first ever figure skating club was started in 1742 in Edinburgh, Scotland. World Championships began in 1896 (the first in Saint Petersburg, Russia). Before the Winter Olympic Games were started, competitions in figure skating were part of the Summer Olympic Games, in 1908 Summer Olympics and 1920 Summer Olympics. == Rules == The International Skating Union (ISU) made the rules. === Singles skating === Singles skating is composed of a Short Program and a Free Skate. Both of them have a technical score and a presentation score. * The '''Short Program (SP)''' must include two solo jumps, a jump combination consisting of two jumps, three spins and one Step Sequence fully utilizing the ice surface. * '''Free Skate (FS)''' contains jump elements, jump combinations or jump sequences. The Free Skate also has three spins, one Step Sequence fully utilizing the ice surface and a choreographic sequence. == Judges == Under the ISU Judging System the Judges focus entirely on evaluating the quality of each element performed (technical aspect) and the quality of the performance. There will be a panel of nine Judges per segment. Out of these nine scores, the highest and lowest score of each element or program component are ignored and the average will be taken. === Technical score === The score for the element is composed of a "Base Value" of each element and the "Grade of Execution - GOE". GOE is that the Judge grades the quality of the element on a scale of +5 to -5. The total of all the elements scores gives the Technical Score. === Presentation score === The Judges award points on a scale from 0.25 to 10.00 with increments of 0.25 for the Presentation Score to grade the overall presentation of the performance. There are five items in the Presentation Score. ====Skating skills==== :Over all skating quality '''Transitions, Linking Footwork and Movement''' :The varied and/or intricate footwork, positions, movements, and holds that link all elements. This also includes the entrances and exits of technical elements. '''Performance/Execution''' :The physical and emotional involvement of the skater/couple as they translate the intent of the music and choreography. '''Choreography/Composition''' :The arrangement of all movements according to the principles of proportion, space and music. '''Interpretation''' :The translation of the music to movement on ice. == Jumps == There are six types of jump that ISU decides to score. The following items are listed in order of the score (difficulty). There are two types of jumps: edge jump and toe jump. The Axel, loop, and Salchow are edge jumps and the lutz, flip and toe loop are toe jumps. :'''Axel''' ::This is the only jump where a skater takes off while skating forward. It's the most difficult jump of the six. :'''Lutz''' ::The skater takes off from the back outside edge of the left or right foot and pokes the ice with the opposite toe. :'''Flip''' ::The skater takes off from the back inside edge of the left or right foot and pokes the ice with the opposite toe. :'''Loop''' ::The skater takes off from the back outside edge of the right or left foot. This jump is often used in second jump of combination jump. :'''Salchow''' ::The skater takes off from the back inside edge of the right or left foot. :'''Toe Loop''' ::The skater takes off from the back outside edge of the right or left foot and pokes the ice with the opposite toe. This is the easiest jump and it is often used in second jump of combination jump. == Spins == Spins are classified as Sit spins, Upright spins or Camel spin. Each of them has various variations. Any position which is not basic is a non-basic position. ===Sit spin=== The position of this spin is that the upper part of the skating leg is at least parallel to the ice. *there are three categories based on position of free leg ::Sit Forward (with leg forward) ::Sit Sideways (with leg sideways) ::Sit Behind (with the leg behind) ===Upright spin=== The position of this spin is any position with the skating leg is extended or slightly bent which is not a camel position. *there are four categories based on position of the torso. ::Upright Forward (with torso leaning forward) ::Upright Straight or Sideways (with torso straight up or sideways) ::Upright Biellmann (in Biellmann position) ::Upright Layback ===Camel spin=== The position of this spin is any position where the free leg backwards and the knee is higher than the hip level, however Layback, Biellmann and similar variations are still considered upright spins. *There are three categories based on the direction of the belly button. ::Camel Forward (with belly button facing forward) ::Camel Sideways (with belly button facing sideways) ::Camel Upward (with belly button facing upward) == Turns and Steps == *Turns ::three turns, twizzles, brackets, loops, counters, rockers :Turns must be executed on one foot. If a turn is "jumped", it is not counted as performed. *Steps ::toe steps, chasses, mohawks, choctaws, change of edge, cross rolls :Steps must be executed on one foot whenever possible. == Some well-known figure skaters == {| !Women!!!!Men |- |style="width: 40%"| * Miki Ando (Japan) * Shizuka Arakawa (Japan) * Mao Asada (Japan) * Oksana Baiul (Ukraine) * Lu Chen (China) * Sasha Cohen (United States) * Carol Heiss (United States) * Sonja Henie (Norway) * Michelle Kwan (United States) * Tara Lipinski (United States) * Kimmie Meissner (United States) * Charlotte Oelschlagel (Germany) * Irina Slutskaya (Russia) * Adelina Sotnikova (Russia) * Fumie Suguri (Japan) * Akiko Suzuki (Japan) * Madge Syers (Britain) * Ashley Wagner (United States) * Katarina Witt (East Germany) * Kristi Yamaguchi (United States) * Kim Yu-Na (South Korea) * Alina Zagitova (Russia) |style="width: 20%"| |style="width: 40%"| * Brian Boitano (United States) * Kurt Browning (Canada men's national ice hockey team) * Jeffrey Buttle (Canada) * Patrick Chan (Canada) * Nathan Chen (United States) * Toller Cranston (Canada) * Jackson Haines (United States) * Scott Hamilton (United States) * Yuzuru Hanyu (Japan) * Brian Joubert (France) * Takahiko Kozuka (Japan) * Stéphane Lambiel (Switzerland) * Evan Lysacek (United States) * Nobunari Oda (Japan) * Evgeni Plushenko (Russia) * Ulrich Salchow (Sweden) * Karl Schafer (Austria) * Elvis Stojko (Canada) * Daisuke Takahashi (Japan) |} Pairs: * Emilie Rotter & Laszlo Szolas (Hungary) * Maxi Herber & Ernst Baier (Germany) * Barbara Wagner & Robert Paul (Canada) * Ludmila Belousova & Oleg Protopopov (USSR) * Irina Rodnina & Alexei Ulyanov (USSR) * Irina Rodnina & Alexander Zaitsev (USSR) * Ekaterina Gordeeva & Sergei Grinkov (USSR) * Xue Shen & Hongbo Zhao (China) * Tatiana Totmianina & Maxim Marinin (Russia) * Dorota Siudek & Mariusz Siudek (Poland) *Aljona Savchenko & Robin Szolkowy (Germany) *Aljona Savchenko & Bruno Massot (Germany) *Sui Wenjing & Han Cong (China) Ice dance: * Jean Westwood & Lawrence Demmy (Britain) * Eva Romanova & Pavel Roman (Czechoslovakia) * Diane Towler & Bernard Ford (Britain) * Lyudmila Pakhomova & Alexander Gorshkov (USSR) * Jayne Torvill & Christopher Dean (Britain) * Natalia Bestemianova & Andrei Bukin (USSR) * Isabelle Duchesnay & Paul Duchesnay (France/Canada) * Marina Klimova & Sergei Ponomarenko (Russia) * Oksana Grishuk & Evgeny Platov (Russia) * Tatiana Navka & Roman Kostomarov (Russia) * Tanith Belbin & Benjamin Agosto (United States) * Meryl Davis & Charlie White (United States) * Tessa Virtue & Scott Moir (Canada) *Gabriella Papadakis & Guillaume Cizeron (France) == Related pages == *Ice dancing ==References== == Other websites == *[http://www.google.com/images?client=flock&channel=fds&q=figure+skating&oe=utf-8&um=1&ie=UTF-8&source=univ&ei=FVhMTffjC46osQPxo8m2Cg&sa=X&oi=image_result_group&ct=title&resnum=6&ved=0CGsQsAQwBQ&biw=939&bih=515 Images for figure skating] *[http://heatherw.com/mk/sch.htm Figure Skating TV Schedule] *[http://www.google.com/search?client=flock&channel=fds&q=figure+skating&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t#q=figure+skating&start=10&hl=en&sa=N&prmd=ivnsul&source=univ&tbs=vid:1&tbo=u&ei=JFlMTd_FGYWisQOtsK3SCg&oi=video_result_group&ct=title&resnum=2&ved=0CEcQqwQwATgK&fp=d9844f08d4525a5 Videos for figure skating] Category:Figure skating Category:Winter Olympic sports
