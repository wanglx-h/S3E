'''Bebop''' or '''bop''' is a kind of jazz that became popular near the beginning of the Second World War, in the mid-1940s. Bebop is often fast. The musicians improvisation using a small group of chords which are repeated again and again. Charlie Parker (1920-1955), who was famous for his saxophone playing, was a bebop artist. The famous trumpet player Dizzy Gillespie (1917-1993) was also a renowned artist of this genre. The term "bebop" originates from a group of syllables used in '''scat singing''', where random strings of sound were used in place of words. Category:African-American culture Category:Jazz music
