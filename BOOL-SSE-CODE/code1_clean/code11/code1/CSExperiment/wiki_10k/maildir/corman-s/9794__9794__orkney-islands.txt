It is about 16 kilometres north of Caithness. 20 of the about 70 islands have people living on them.Haswell-Smith (2004) pp. 336-403.Wickham-Jones (2007) p. 1 states there are 67 islands. The administrative centre is Kirkwall (with about 8000 people living there). The next largest settlements are Stromness (2000 people) and St. Margaret's Hope (with about 550 people). In addition to the mainland, most of the islands are in two groups, the North and South Isles. All of them are made of sandstone. The climate is mild and the soil is fertile. Most of the land is farmed and agriculture is the main source of income for the economy. There are many birds and fish. In 2023 there were proposals that the islands could change their status in the UK, to be more like the Isle of Man or even become a self-governing territory of Norway. == Transportation == Ferry services go much of the time to Lerwick (in Shetland). Most islands have air strips (for airplanes). This includes the shortest known flight service in the world, between Westray and Papa Westray. Official flight time is 2 minutes. If the wind goes in the right direction, the flight can take just over a minute. == References == File:ScotlandOrkneyIslands.png]] == Other websites == * [http://www.orkney.com/ Orkney.com] Official website Category:Orkney Category:Counties of Scotland Category:Scottish Council Areas Category:Archipelagos
