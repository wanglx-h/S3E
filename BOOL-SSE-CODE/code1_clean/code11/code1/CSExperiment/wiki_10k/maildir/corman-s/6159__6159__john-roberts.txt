Appointed by President George W. Bush, Roberts is generally considered a member of the more Conservatism in the United States wing of the court. However, since the retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy, he has been seen as the moderate and tie-breaker in some major Supreme Court cases during the Presidency of Donald Trump. Before joining the Supreme Court of the United States on September 29, 2005, Roberts was a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for two years. Roberts has been portrayed as a consistent advocate for conservative principles by analysts such as Jeffrey Toobin. Roberts was first nominated by President George W. Bush to replace Sandra Day O'Connor as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, but Chief Justice William Rehnquist died before Roberts's confirmation so Bush nominated Roberts to replace Rehnquist instead. Roberts was confirmed by the full United States Senate on September 29 by a margin of 78–22. == References == Category:United States Supreme Court justices Category:Chief justices of the United States Category:American Roman Catholics Category:Politicians from Buffalo, New York Category:1955 births Category:Living people Category:Lawyers from Buffalo, New York
