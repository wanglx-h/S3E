She was the first woman to serve as justice on the Supreme Court. Until 1993, she was the only woman on the court. One of her ideas on the Supreme Court was the endorsement test. It was a way to check if the government was supporting religion. ==Life== O'Connor was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1981 by President Ronald Reagan. Reagan said while running for president that he wanted a woman to be on the Supreme Court and promised to nominate a woman for the job the first chance he got. One of her biggest supporters was Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater, who helped make sure that all 100 Senators voted to confirm her. While on the Supreme Court, she was involved in several major Supreme Court decisions including: Bush v. Gore, which had to do with a disputed election; Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which involved a woman's right to privacy. She was also involved in Lawrence v. Texas, a case about whether burning a US flag was free speech. She retired from the court in 2006. Samuel Alito was chosen to replace her. On August 12, 2009, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. This is the highest civilian honor of the United States. It was given by President Barack Obama. In October 2018, O’Connor announced her retirement from public life after revealing that she was diagnosed with the early stages of dementia.[https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/23/politics/justice-sandra-day-oconnor-dementia-alzheimers Justice O'Connor announces she has been diagnosed with dementia, 'probably Alzheimer's'] at CNN On December 1, 2023, O'Connor died in Phoenix, Arizona from problems caused by dementia and respiratory failure, aged 93. ==Things named after her == She has a high school named after her in North Phoenix, Arizona.
