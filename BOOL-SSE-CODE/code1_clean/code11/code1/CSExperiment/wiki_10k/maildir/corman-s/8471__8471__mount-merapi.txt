An earthquake occurred in that region on May 27, 2006, and killed about 6,200 people. On June 6, super hot gas and ash poured down the mountain. These hot gases are known as a Pyroclastic flow flow. Two people were killed, and 15,000 people rushed to safety. == 2010 eruption == File:Destroyed house in Cangkringan Village after the 2010 Eruptions of Mount Merapi.jpg On 25 October 2010 the Indonesian government warned villagers living near the mountain to move to safer ground. Officials said hundreds of volcanic earthquakes had been recorded on the mountain over the weekend of 23–24 October, and that the magma had risen to about 1 kilometre (3,300ft) below the surface due to the seismic activity. People living within a 20km (12.5 mile) zone were told they must leave. On the afternoon of 25 October 2010 lava erupted from the southern and south-eastern slopes of Mount Merapi. Many more followed over the next two weeks. There were also pyroclastic flows. After the recovery of more bodies, an official in disaster management said the death toll reached 273 up to 18 November. == References == Category:Volcanoes of Indonesia
