The capital city of New Brunswick is Fredericton. Other large cities are Saint John, New Brunswick and Moncton. Nearly 860,000 people live in New Brunswick, as of 2025. The province is bordered by Quebec in the west, Nova Scotia in the east and the United States state of Maine in the south. There is a link to Prince Edward Island also. The English language and French language languages are both spoken in New Brunswick, and it is the only Provinces and territories of Canada where both languages are Official language. This is because about 33% of the people living in New Brunswick speak French.
