Marketed as a separate network for ratings purposes, Adult Swim broadcasts from 7p.m. to 6a.m. (Mondays-Saturdays) and from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. (Sundays) Eastern Time Zone/Pacific Time Zone. Debuting on March 2, 2001, Adult Swim serves as the nighttime identity of Cartoon Network, and it was established as alternative programming during late night hours when Cartoon Network's primary target audience would normally be sleeping. By 2005, Adult Swim would be granted its own separate Nielsen ratings report from Cartoon Network due to it targeting a different audience. The block features stylistically varied animated and live-action shows, including original programming, syndicated series, anime, original video animations, and short films with generally minimal or no editing for content. Adult Swim has frequently aired adult animation features, Mockumentary, sketch comedy, and Television pilot. The block's shows are known for their sexual themes, frank sexual discussion, nudity, strong language, and graphic violence. Many of its programs are aesthetically experimental, transgressive, improvised, and Surrealism in nature. Adult Swim has contracted with various studios known for their productions in absurdity and shock value comedy. ==References== Category:2001 establishments in California Category:Adult Swim Category:American television networks Category:American television series Category:American television stations Category:NBCUniversal
