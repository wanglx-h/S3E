Restriction orders are still in place for the production, transportation and consumption of food contaminated by Chernobyl fallout]] File:Chernobyl-4 and the Memorial 2009-001.jpg The '''Chernobyl disaster''' was a nuclear power disaster. It happened on April 26,1986 at the Chernobyl power plant near the town of Pripyat, Ukraine. At that time, Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union. The station is 110 kilometers north of the nation's capital, Kyiv. The event was one of the worst nuclear accident in the history of nuclear power. It was rated level 7, the most severe level, on the International Nuclear Event Scale. The only other accident with a level 7 rating is Fukushima nuclear disaster. The RBMK reactors that were used at the plant had no containment building to keep the radiation in. radioactivity nuclear fallout drifted over parts of the western Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, Scandinavia, the United Kingdom, and the eastern United States. Large areas of Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia were badly contaminated. Approximately 60% of the radioactive fallout landed in Belarus. About 360,000 people needed to be relocated after the accident. Many people suffered from acute radiation poisoning and long-term illnesses such as thyroid cancer. ==Cause of the accident== On the day of the incident, there was a planned power reduction. By the beginning of the day Shift work, the power level had reached 50%. Then, one of the regional Power station went offline. On the afternoon of April 25 there was a request that the further power reduction would be postponed. Further power down was allowed after 22:00. A turbine Electrical generator run down test was to take place before the routine shutdown. At 00:05 on April 26, the power was at about 23%. 30 minutes later, the power fell to near zero, probably due to change of regulator. At 01:00 the power stabilized at around 6%. The test would be run at that level. A turbine was switched off and its Oscillation were measured. Shift foreman A.F. Akimov reported to deputy-chief engineer A.S. Dyatlov (who supervised the power down) that the oscillations were measured. A final briefing was given. Everyone went to their instruments and at 01:23:04 the turbine generator run down test began. Everything went completely normally. The reactor showed a tendency to accelerate as the cooling pumps connected to the turbine generator were slowing, due to the property called positive void coefficient of reactivity. As number of so-called ‘voids’ (e.g. steam bubbles) increases due to increased boiling or loss of coolant, so does the reactivity. The operators successfully kept the reactor in control and it did not accelerate. At 01:23:40 senior reactor chief control engineer L.F. Toptunov pressed the emergency shutdown button (also called 'SCRAM', or 'AZ-5' in RBMK reactors), causing control rods to rapidly insert into the reactor core to absorb neutrons (intended to immediately stop the nuclear chain reaction and thus shut down the reactor). The power was at 7% when the button was pressed. Instead of shutting down, the reactor suffered a power surge. This was due to the reactor being unstable at low power. The graphite-tipped control rods first displaced neutron-absorbing coolant with neutron-moderating graphite, which briefly increased reactivity instead of reducing it. This, now known to be a design flaw, caused a sudden power spike, and at 01:23:43 the power jumped to 17%. Due to the power increase, the automatic control rods suffered damage and they jammed. Fuel channels ruptured and at 01:23:47:53 the reactor exploded. The explosion was so powerful that it blew the 1000 ton steel lid off the reactor. The explosion released large amounts of radioactive materials and fuel. The neutron moderator, made of graphite, started to burn. The fire released more radioactive fallout, which was carried away by the smoke. After the accident, Reactor 4 was covered by a "sarcophagus" made from steel and concrete to stop the escape of more radiation from the lost corium as well as radioactive dust. The sarcophagus was covered in 2016 with the New Safe Confinement structure. ==Disputes== The accident raised concerns about the safety of the Soviet nuclear power industry. The Soviet Union slowed the process of making its nuclear industry bigger for some time. The government also had to become less Secrecy as a result of the accident. Since 1991, Russia, Ukraine and Belarus have become separate countries. Those countries have continued to pay the high costs for decontamination (removing the radioactive material) and health care because of the accident. Exposure to radiation leads to a higher risk of cancer. ==Deaths and longterm effects== It is difficult to count the number of deaths caused by the events at Chernobyl. A 2005 International Atomic Energy Agency report tells of 56 direct deaths. 47 were accident workers, and 9 were children who died of thyroid cancer. The report estimates that up to 4,000 people may die from long term diseases related to the accident. However, other Estimation range from 4,000 to 27,000 by the Union of Concerned Scientists. Greenpeace estimate that between 93,000 to 200,000 people died as a result of the disaster. Following the disaster, babies and animals born around Chernobyl had defects, such as Cerebrovascular disease, physical Deformation, and Mental illness The animals exposed to high levels of radiation were born with physical deformities and Mutation Birds were born with smaller brains and less viable sperm. ==Aftermath== The other three reactors at Chernobyl continued to operate after the disaster because there were not enough other power plants in Ukraine to meet energy demands. Reactor 2 was permanently turned off and stopped being used in 1991 after a fire in its turbine hall. Reactor 1 was decommissioned in 1996, and Reactor 3 was decommissioned in 2000. In 2018, a 3800-panel, 1-megawatt solar plant was opened next to the former nuclear plant. == 2025 drone crash and effects == File:Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant confinement after drone strike, 2025-02-14 (13).jpg On Friday, February 14, 2025, a drone armed with a warhead struck the outer shell of the Chernobyl sarcophagus, damaging it. So far, the radiation levels are normal, with no dramatic increases. While no extremely major damage was done, it will take time to repair the sarcophagus. ==Gallery== File:Swimming Pool Building 3 (out)-Pripyat.jpg File:Palace of Culture Front.jpg File:Pripyat - Bumper cars.jpg File:Chernobyl nuclear disaster aftermath abandoned town of Pripyat 01.jpg ==Related pages== * Fukushima nuclear disaster * Nuclear disasters * Ukraine * Nuclear power * Soviet Union * Chernobyl ==References== == Other websites == * [http://chornobylmuseum.kiev.ua The National Museum Chernobyl Accident] * [http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/Focus/Chernobyl/index.html IAEA Website about the Chernobyl Accident] Category:1986 in Europe Category:1980s explosions in Europe Category:1980s in the Soviet Union Category:20th century in Ukraine Category:Disasters in the Soviet Union Category:Explosions in 1986 Category:Nuclear accidents Category:Chernobyl Category:April 1986 events
