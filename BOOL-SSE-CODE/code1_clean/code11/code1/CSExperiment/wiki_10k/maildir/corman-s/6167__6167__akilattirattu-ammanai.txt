'''Akilathirattu Ammanai''' (; from ''akilam'' (world) + ''thirattu'' (collection) + ''ammanai'' (ballad)), also called '''Thiru Edu''' (venerable book), is the main religious book of the Southern Indian Ayyavazhi, officially a branch of Hinduism. The title is shortened as Akilam. This is the largest Ammanai work. it has more than 15,000 verses. ==History== According to the book, Hari Gopalan Citar wrote this book on the twenty-seventh day of the Tamil Nadu month of Karthikai (November/December) in the year 1016 ME (1839 CE). He says that God woke him up during his sleep and ordered him to take the first words from what he said. Akilathirattu was recorded on palm leaves. Then in 1939 it was Printer (publishing). The book is the story of God coming in this age, the Kali Yukam or Iron Age, to rule the world by transforming it into that of Dharma Yukam. This story of faith has woven together the historical facts about Ayya Vaikundar and his activities, with mixing of episodes from the Hindu Puranas (mythologies) and Itihasas (epics). It is presented as if Vishnu is telling the whole story to his consort Lakshmi. Though the Seedars Hari Gopalan wrote the book he did not know any thing about the contents of the book. He woke up in the morning as usual and he did not know what he had written the day before. It contains the regulations of the Ayyavazhi sect. G.
