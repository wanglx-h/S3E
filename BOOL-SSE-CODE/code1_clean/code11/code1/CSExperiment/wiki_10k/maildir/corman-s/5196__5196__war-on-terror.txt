It replaced the later War in Afghanistan and Iraq War. United States President George W. Bush argued that the countries like North Korea, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Libya (also known as the Axis of Evil) were a direct threat to the United States and its allies. The term was typically used with a particular focus on Taliban, Islamic State, and al-Qaeda. The Administration of former U.S. President Barack Obama used the term ''Overseas Contingency Operation''.[http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/03/25/obama-scraps-global-war-terror-overseas-contingency-operation Obama Scraps 'Global War on Terror' for 'Overseas Contingency Operation'.] == See also == * Islamic State attacks on Israel * War in Afghanistan (2001–2021) * Gulf War ==Notes== ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:Terrorism Category:Foreign relations of the United States Category:Wars involving the United States Category:Al-Qaeda Category:Islamic State Category:21st century in the United States
