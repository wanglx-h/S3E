In 1997 he had to leave his home, after it was flooded by the water of the dam. Since that time he tries to get together with other people fair damages from the China. On 19 May 2006 he had an interview with the Germany television station ARD (broadcaster). After this one he was arrested by police and hit so he cannot move since that time and is crippled. He did not get any medical help, because he cannot pay it. The German government protested against this situation. In June 2006, the German embassy paid for the life-saving medical treatment. The Chinese government said they did not hit him, so he must have hit himself. == Other websites == * [http://www.threegorgesprobe.org/tgp/index.cfm?DSP=content&ContentID=15652 Article of an international Organisation ] * [http://www.faz.net/s/RubDDBDABB9457A437BAA85A49C26FB23A0/Doc~EE104874F23E246159F914FD3FD31A3EB~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html Article of the german Newspaper FAZ (german)] * [https://www.tagesschau.de/aktuell/meldungen/0,1185,OID5620318,00.html Interview with the reporter of the german newsstation (german)] Category:Chinese activists Category:Civil rights activists Category:20th-century Chinese people Category:21st-century Chinese people
