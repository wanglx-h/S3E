It is near Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, and Tanzania. In the Rwandan genocide of 1994, over one million (1,000,000) people were killed. ==History== ===Colonialism=== During the Scramble for Africa, Belgium conquered Rwanda. The Belgians then began to divide Rwandans into groups: Hutu and Tutsi. The Belgians picked people that they thought looked more European to be Tutsi. The rest became Hutu. The Belgians told Rwandans that Tutsi were superior to Hutu. They helped Tutsi rule over Hutu using their army. ===After independence=== On July 1, 1962, Rwanda became Independence and Hutu were given power. Thus, anti-Tutsi Purge occurred frequently. Many Tutsi fled to Uganda, where they formed the Rwandan Patriotic Front, or RPF, which tried to Invasion Rwanda in 1990. ===Genocide=== ''See the main article: Rwandan genocide'' On the night of April 6, 1994, dictator Juvénal Habyarimana's Airplane was shot down, but it is still not clear who did it. Within half an hour, roadblocks manned by the Interahamwe militia were seen all over the capital, Kigali. A genocide against the Tutsi people began. The Rwandan genocide lasted for about 100 days, and it left over one million (1,000,000) Tutsi and moderate Hutu dead. The main weapon used was the machete, or ''umupanga''. Other countries paid little attention to the killings. On July 2, 1994, the RPF captured Kigali. ==Geography== File:KageraRuvubu.jpg and Ruvubu River rivers, part of the upper Nile|alt=Photograph of confluence of the Kagera and the Ruvubu, with the Rwanda-Tanzania border post in foreground, taken from a nearby hilltop]] === Size & location === Rwanda is in Central Africa/East Africa.
