File:Briefs.jpg '''Briefs''' are a type of short underwear for males or females. They provide a close fit, and come in either white, or in other colors like blue, pink, or red. For male briefs, before the 2000s, briefs often came with hard elastic waistbands. This would cause stretch marks, and this was eventually replaced by the soft elastic waistband. However, hard elastic waistbands are still found on generic store brand underwear (that save consumer and manufacturing costs by not being fashion forward). Female briefs are also called knickers or panties. Category:Underwear Category:Bottoms (clothing)
