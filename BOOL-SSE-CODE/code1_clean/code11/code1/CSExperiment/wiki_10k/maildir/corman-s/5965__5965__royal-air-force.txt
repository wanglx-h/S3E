File:Air Force Ensign of the United Kingdom.svg The '''Royal Air Force''' (acronym: '''RAF''') is the air force of the United Kingdom. The RAF began in 1918 when the Royal Flying Corps (pronounced ''core'') and the Royal Naval Air Service joined together. It is the oldest air force in the world. The first man to lead the RAF was Hugh Trenchard, 1st Viscount Trenchard. The RAF has many bases across the world, including the United Kingdom, Falkland Islands, Cyprus and Gibraltar. Some examples of the British bases are RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland, RAF Valley in Wales, RAF Aldergrove in Northern Ireland and RAF Linton-on Ouse in England. The RAF has new airplanes including the Eurofighter Typhoon, Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II and the BAE Systems Hawk. The Hawk is used to train fast jet pilots. At the end of 2022 the UK had 30 Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II. == World War II == The RAF were very busy during World War II. Many important planes were built for the RAF. The Supermarine Spitfire and Hawker Hurricane helped defend Britain during the Battle of Britain. The Avro Lancaster bomber attacked Germany with strategic bombing. The RAF lost great numbers of pilots and aircraft, fighting around the world and especially against the ''Luftwaffe'', the German Air Force. == References == == Other websites == * [https://www.greatwarforum.org/topic/283560-just-got-this-rfc-album-from-a-clearance-but-do-t-know-much-about-it/ 241 Squadron RAF 1918 Great War Forum] * [http://www.raf.mod.uk The RAF website] * [http://www.airliners.net/search/photo.search?sort_order=photo_id%20DESC&first_this_page=0&page_limit=15&thumbnails=&search_values=&airlinesearch=UK%20-%20Air%20Force&maxres=500&new_maxres=rem pictures of RAF planes in action] Category:Royal Air Force Category:1918 establishments in Europe Category:1910s establishments in the United Kingdom
