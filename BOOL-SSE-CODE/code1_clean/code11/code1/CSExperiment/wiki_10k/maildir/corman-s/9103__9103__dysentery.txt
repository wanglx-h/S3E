It is caused by a bacterium, which causes the intestines to swell up a lot. The opposite of dysentry is enteritis (diarrhea with no blood). The main symptom of dysentery is having blood or mucus in the Feces. Other symptoms are high fever and abdominal pain. It is usually treated with antibiotics. The diarrhea is severe and can be a problem for the people who catch the disease. ==Related pages== *Vomit Category:Diseases caused by bacteria Category:Diseases and disorders of the digestive system
