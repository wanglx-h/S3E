It used to be called Upper Volta and the name was changed to Burkina Faso in 1984. The country was once ruled by France, but it has been independent since 1960. The capital is Ouagadougou. In 2005, about 13,228,000 people lived in the country. It is next to Mali, Niger, Benin, Togo, Ghana and Côte d'Ivoire. It does not have any coast with an ocean or sea. People from Burkina Faso are called Burkinabé (pronounced burr-KEE-na-bay). ==History== People have lived in the area of Burkina Faso for thousands of years. At first, they were hunter-gatherers, hunting animals and collecting fruits and vegetables. Later they became farmers. People called the Mossi arrived between the 11th and 13th centuries. They ruled the area until the end of the 19th century. In 1896 France beat the Mossi kingdom and became the colonialism rulers of Burkina Faso. After World War I, the country was called Upper Volta. In 1960, Upper Volta became independent from France. The first president of the new country was Maurice Yaméogo. After he became the president, Yaméogo banned other political party. For several years the people of Upper Volta were very unhappy with the government and in 1966 the military took over in a military Coup d'état. In 1983 the government was taken over again by military men called Thomas Sankara and Blaise Compaoré. Sankara became president. In 1984, he changed the name of the country to Burkina Faso. It means "land of honest people". In December 1985, Burkina Faso went to war for five days with near-by country Mali. In 1987, there was another military coup and Sankara was assassination (murdered). Blaise Compaoré became the president. On 28 October 2014 protesters began to march and demonstrate in Ouagadougou. Compaoré was ready to change the constitution and wikt:extend his 27-year rule. On 30 October 2014, some protesters set fire to the parliament. They also took over the national television headquarters. On 31 October 2014, President Compaoré, resigned after 27 years in office. In 2015 the country held their first election. Roch Marc Christian Kaboré, a former Prime Minister of Burkina Faso, was elected as president. In 2022, Kaboré was removed from power during a January 2022 Burkina Faso coup d'état led by Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba. ==Regions, provinces, and departments== Burkina Faso is divided into thirteen regions, forty-five Provinces of Burkina Faso, and 301 departments.
