Often called the "hound of Hades", Cerberus was one of the numerous offspring of the monsters Typhon and Echidna (mythology); he is usually depicted as having three heads, along with a serpent for a tail. ==Other websites== Category:Greek legendary creatures Category:Afterlife Category:Gods and goddesses of the underworld
