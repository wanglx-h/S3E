A camper named '''Christy''' makes a deal with the villain that makes her a success at anything she never did before, even cartwheels. In turn, he plans to forever capture the Care Bears and Care Bear Cousins, one at a time, inside a magic red bag, and them trap them all inside a secret location somewhere at camp. Christy's two friends, '''Dawn''' and '''John''', later join the Care Bear Family so that they can put an end to his evil doings. ==Facts== An episode of DiC's Care Bears show also took place at a summer camp. But the storyline of ''A New Generation'' does not borrow from it.

Her second and final 1980s appearance was in the animated series' "Great Race" episode. ==Related pages== *''The Care Bears Movie'', the original movie from 1985 == Other websites == * *[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/care_bears_movie_2_a_new_generation ''Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation'' at Rotten Tomatoes] Category:1986 animated movies Category:1980s family movies Category:1980s sequel movies Category:Canadian animated movies Category:Canadian family movies Category:English-language movies Category:Movies about demons Category:Columbia Pictures movies
