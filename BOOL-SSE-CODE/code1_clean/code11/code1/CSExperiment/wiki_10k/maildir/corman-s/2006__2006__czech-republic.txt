The Capital (city) and the biggest city is Prague (, ). The currency is the Czech Crown (''koruna česká'' - CZK). €1 is about 23 CZK. The president of Czechia is Petr Pavel. Czechia's population is about 10.5 million. The local language is the Czech language, a Slavic language related to languages like Slovak language and Polish language. Czechia landlocked; its neighbour countries are Germany, Austria, Slovakia, and Poland. == History == Its history dates from the 9th century AD, for a long time it was one of the most powerful countries in Central Europe. Later on it was the biggest, most populated and richest country of the First Reich, where many Emperors started their career. Under the conditions of the Treaty of Vienna 1515 parts of Czechia, then in the Kingdoms of Bohemia and Hungary, came under Habsburg Monarchy rule after the death of Jagiellonian dynasty in 1526. They stayed a part of the Habsburg dynasty rule until 1918. The area of the today's Czechia was a part of Czechoslovakia (current area of Czechia and Slovakia) from 1918 to 1992. Czechoslovakia became Independence in 1918 from Austro-Hungarian Empire. The first Czechoslovakian president was Tomas Garrigue Masaryk. In February 1948 the Communist party took over the country and for the next 41 years Czechoslovakia was a Socialist state with a rule of one (Communist) party. In 1968 there was a reformation movement (Prague Spring) within the Communist party, but reforms were stopped by the invasion of Warsaw Pact armies. In November 1989 Czechoslovakia returned to democracy through the peaceful "Velvet Revolution". Czechoslovakia peacefully split into two countries (Czechia and Slovakia) in 1993. Czechia has been a member of the European Union since 1 May 2004, and a member of NATO since 12 March 1999. ==Geography== The Czech Republic is between the latitude of 48° and 51° N and Longitude 12° and 19° E Western Czechia is made up of Bohemia.
