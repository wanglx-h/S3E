He was the governor of the United States U.S. state of California from 2003 to 2011. He currently lives in Los Angeles, California. After serving in the army, Schwarzenegger moved to Munich, where he often slept in a gym because he did not have anywhere else to live. Schwarzenegger then moved to the United States in 1968 and eventually became an actor. He has been in several big budget Hollywood movies including ''The Terminator'' series. He eventually stopped acting in order to run for governor of California in 2003. In 2003, Governor Gray Davis was removed as governor and Schwarzenegger was elected. His term ended in early January 2011, and he was replaced by Jerry Brown. Before becoming an actor, Schwarzenegger was also a bodybuilder and had won both the Mr. Olympia and Mr. Universe titles over 7 consecutive times. Schwarzenegger has also set up his own official competition, Arnold Classic. In 1971, Schwarzenegger's younger maternal half-brother Meinhard died in a car accident due to driving while drunk. In 1986, Schwarzenegger married Maria Shriver, but they separated and divorced in 2021. They have 2 daughters, Katherine and Christina, and also 2 sons, Patrick and Christopher. Schwarzenegger also has a son with another woman. Some people think that Arnold had cheated on his wife but, such statements have not been proven. In 2013, Schwarzenegger returned to acting with a role in the movie ''Escape Plan''. == Film == {| class="wikitable plainrowheaders sortable" style="margin-right: 0;" |- ! scope="col" | Year ! scope="col" | Title ! scope="col" | Role ! scope="col" class="unsortable" | Notes ! scope="col" class="unsortable" | |- ! scope=row| 1970 | ''Hercules in New York'' | Hercules | Credited as Arnold Strong "Mr. Universe" | |- ! scope=row| 1973 | ''The Long Goodbye (film)'' | Hood in Augustine's Office | Uncredited cameo | style="text-align:center;" | |- ! scope=row| 1976 | ''Stay Hungry'' | Joe Santo | | |- ! scope=row| 1979 | ''The Villain (1979 film)'' | "Handsome Stranger" | | |- ! scope=row| 1979 | ''Scavenger Hunt'' | Lars | Cameo | |- ! scope=row| 1982 | ''Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)'' | Conan the Barbarian | | |- ! scope=row| 1984 | ''Conan the Destroyer'' | Conan the Destroyer | | |- ! scope=row| 1984 | ''The Terminator'' | Terminator (character) | | |- ! scope=row| 1985 | ''Red Sonja (1985 film)'' | Lord Kalidor | | |- ! scope=row| 1985 | ''Commando (1985 film)'' | Colonel John Matrix | | |- ! scope=row| 1986 | ''Raw Deal (1986 film)'' | Sheriff Mark Kaminsky / Joseph P.
