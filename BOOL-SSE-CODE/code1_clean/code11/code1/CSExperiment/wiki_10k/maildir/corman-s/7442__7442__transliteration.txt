Subject: Transliteration
'''Transliteration''' is a conversion of a text from one writing system to another.G. Gerych. [https://ruor.uottawa.ca/bitstream/10393/22477/1/EC56137.PDF Transliteration of Cyrillic Alphabets.] Ottawa University, April 1965. 126pp.Kharusi N.S. & Salman A. 2011. The English transliteration of place names in Oman. ''Journal of Academic and Applied Studies'' '''1'''(3), pp. 1–27. Available online at www.academians.org It swaps letter (alphabet) in predictable ways (such as alpha → a, de (Cyrillic) → d, chi (letter) → ch, ն → n or æ → ae). The word comes from the prefix '':wikt:trans-'' (in this case, referring to switching the letters around) + the Latin language word '':wikt:littera#Latin'' (meaning "letter") + the suffix '':wikt:-ation'' (which makes the word into a noun that talks about the process of doing something). Transliteration is not about the phonetics of the original. It is about the typeface or written characters, mostly the letters. For example, the name for Russia in Cyrillic script, "", is usually transliterated as "Rossiya". So, 'сс' is transliterated as 'ss', but pronounced . Transliteration typically goes grapheme to grapheme. Most transliteration systems are one-to-one, so a reader who knows the system can reconstruct the original spelling. Transliteration is opposed to transcription (linguistics), which maps the ''sounds'' of one language into a writing system. ==Related pages== * Romanization * Diacritic == References == Category:Writing systems Category:Romanization
