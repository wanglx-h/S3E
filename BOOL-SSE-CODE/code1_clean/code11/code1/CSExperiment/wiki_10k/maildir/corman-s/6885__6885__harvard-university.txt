Harvard was started on September 8, 1636, and it is the oldest university in the United States. Harvard's current president is Alan Garber. The school color is crimson, which is a dark red color. Harvard used slaves to serve its leaders and students, and the merchants who used their money to start the school used slaves too. Also, “Harvard students slept in beds and ate meals prepared by slaves, and many grew up to be prominent slave-holders in early America." In the 20th century, the university invested millions of dollars in apartheid South Africa. Harvard is on the Charles River. Some students go to the Charles River for rowing. On the other side of the Charles River is the city of Boston. Boston's Rapid transit system has a stop at Harvard. Some of Harvard's graduate schools are in Boston, but most of Harvard's schools are in Cambridge. Together, these schools are Harvard University. Harvard has many libraries like Widener Library.
