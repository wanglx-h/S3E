More than nine million people speak Swedish. It is similar to two of the other Scandinavian languages, Norwegian language and Danish language, and a person who understands one of these languages can understand the others. Other Scandinavian languages, such as Icelandic language and Faroese language, are less closely related and cannot be understood by Swedish speakers. Standard Swedish is spoken and writing throughout Sweden, but there are some local dialects with differences in grammar and vocabulary in small towns and rural areas. Swedish began as a dialect of Old Norse, which was a language that everyone in Scandinavia understood during the Viking Age. Around the 12th century Swedish began to slowly become different from the other dialects. These dialects later became what we today call Norwegian language, Icelandic language, Faroese language and Danish language. Swedish is a Germanic language with some similarities to English language because of the Vikings that invaded England in the 10th Century. It is even more similar to German language and Dutch language, partly because of the Hanseatic League of the Middle Ages, when Sweden traded very openly with Germany. There are three characters in the Swedish language that are not used in English. These are å, ä and ö. The letter å is a vowel sound between [a] and [o], similar to the English word ''awe''. The letter ä is a vowel sound similar to [ɛ], like in the English word ''bed''. The letter ö is a vowel sound between [o] and [ɛ], pronounced [øː] like the ''u'' in the English word ''burn''. These characters are also used in the Finnish language, while Norwegian and Danish languages replace ä and ö with similar characters æ and ø. Swedish also has some important differences in grammar. Article (grammar) are suffixed onto the end of their nouns, so ''ett hus'' (a house) becomes ''huset'' (the house). Also unlike English, Swedish uses two grammatical genders called ''Common gender'' and ''Neuter''. Nouns of the Common gender are sometimes called "en words", and many words for living (or once-living) things are "en words". Nouns of the Neuter gender are sometimes called "ett words". == Example of some words in Swedish == {| class="wikitable" !Swedish!!English |- ! ! |- | Ett/En One |- | Två Two |- | Tre Three |- | Fyra Four |- | Fem Five |- | Sex Six |- | Sju Seven |- | Åtta Eight |- | Nio Nine |- | Tio Ten |- | Ja Yes |- | Nej No |- | Jag I |- | Du You |- | Mig Me |- | Han He |- | Hon She |- | Vi We |- | De/dem They/them |- | Jag är I am |- | Sverige Sweden |- | Hus House |- | Hem Home |- | Väg Way |- | Björnar Bears |- | Hjälp Help |} == Basic Swedish Expressions == {| class="wikitable" |- | Good day/Hello |- | How are you? |- | Very good, thank you |- | Thank you |- | Thank you very much |- | Good morning |- | Good evening |- | Goodbye |} ==References== == Other websites == *[http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/translation/Swedish/ Swedish Dictionary] from [http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org Webster's Dictionary] *[http://web.hhs.se/isa/swedish/ An introduction to Swedish] *[http://lexin2.nada.kth.se/swe-eng.html Lexin Swedish-English dictionary] Category:North Germanic languages Category:Languages of Sweden Category:Languages of Finland
