Subject: Fermat's primality test
'''Fermat's primality test''' is an algorithm. It can test if a given number ''p'' is probably prime number. There is a flaw however: There are numbers that pass the test, and that are not prime. These numbers are called Carmichael numbers. ==Concept== Fermat's little theorem states that if ''p'' is prime and 1 \le a , then :a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}. If we want to test if ''n'' is prime, then we can pick random ''a'''s in the interval and see if the equation above holds. If the equality does not hold for a value of ''a'', then ''n'' is composite number (not prime). If the equality does hold for many values of ''a'', then we can say that ''n'' is probably prime, or a pseudoprime. It may be in our tests that we do not pick any value for ''a'' such that the equality fails. Any ''a'' such that :a^{n-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{n} when ''n'' is composite is known as a ''Fermat liar''. If we do pick an ''a'' such that :a^{n-1} \not\equiv 1 \pmod{n} then ''a'' is known as a ''Fermat witness'' for the compositeness of ''n''. ''\pmod n'' is the Modular arithmetic operation. Its result is what remains, if p is divided by n. As an example, : 5 \equiv 2 \pmod 3. ==What this test is used for== The RSA algorithm for Public-key cryptography can be done in such a way that it uses this test. This is useful in cryptography.
