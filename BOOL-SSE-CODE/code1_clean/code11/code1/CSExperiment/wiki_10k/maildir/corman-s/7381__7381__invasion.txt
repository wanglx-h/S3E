Subject: Invasion
'''Invasion''' is a word that comes from Latin. Originally, it meant that something ''goes in'' (as in military occupation) of a foreign territory. So far, the following uses are known: * ''Military'': Getting soldier to take control of enemy territory. Often a state invades another to start a war, but invasions can happen anytime during war. An invasion differs from a raid, in which the attacker does not intend to remain. * ''Others'': Sometimes, biologists speak about an invasive species. There might be locust swarms invading, or that some algae spread far more rapidly in new territory. Category:Military Category:Biology
