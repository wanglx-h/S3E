He became known as one of the popular gangsta rappers during the 1990s. Snoop Dogg has also appeared in many movies and television shows throughout his career. ==Early life== The reason why he is called "Snoop Dogg" is because his mother nicknamed him after a character called "Snoopy". Snoop Dogg was a fan of the ''Peanuts'' cartoon, which has the Snoopy character. Snoop Dogg sang in his church choir and played piano as a child. Snoop Dogg's brother, Bing Worthington, was a bad influence for him. He began smoking when he was in the sixth grade. As a young adult, he was involved in gang activity. He was arrested, convicted and put in prison for possession of illegal drugs. ==Musical career== At the beginning of his career, Broadus performed under the stage name Snoop Doggy Dogg. He first appeared on Dr. Dre's first solo album, ''The Chronic'', released in 1992. Later in 1993, Snoop Dogg released his first album ''Doggystyle''. The album became successful. In 1996, his second album, Tha Doggfather, was released. Although the album met with positive acclaim, it was not as successful as his first album. In 2004, his album ''R&G (Rhythm & Gangsta): The Masterpiece'' was released and featured the hit single “Drop It Like It's Hot”. The single became Snoop Dogg's first number one single on the Billboard Hot 100. ===2012–2013: ''Reincarnated''=== In 2012, Snoop Dogg went to Jamaica. He studied the Rastafari movement. He changed his name to Snoop Lion, after the Lion of Judah. This is a name from the tribe of Judah. It is sometimes used to describe Haile Selassie, who is worshipped by Rastafarians. ''Reincarnated'', released in 2013, is his first reggae album. ===2018-2022: ''Bible of Love'' and Super Bowl LVI=== In 2018, Snoop Dogg released his first Gospel music album, ''Bible of Love''. It features appearances from Patti LaBelle, Fred Hammond, Rance Allen, Charlie Wilson (singer), and others. On February 13, 2022, Snoop Dogg performed at the Super Bowl LVI halftime show. Later, he released the album, ''BODR'' (Bacc on Death Row). ==Discography== File:Snoop Dogg logo old.png File:Snoop Dogg logo.png ;Studio albums * ''Doggystyle'' (1993) * ''Tha Doggfather'' (1996) * ''Da Game Is to Be Sold, Not to Be Told'' (1998) * ''No Limit Top Dogg'' (1999) * ''Tha Last Meal'' (2000) * ''Paid tha Cost to Be da Boss'' (2002) * ''R&G (Rhythm & Gangsta): The Masterpiece'' (2004) * ''Tha Blue Carpet Treatment'' (2006) * ''Ego Trippin''' (2008) * ''Malice n Wonderland'' (2009) * ''Doggumentary'' (2011) * ''Reincarnated (album)'' (2013) * ''Bush (album)'' (2015) * ''Coolaid'' (2016) * ''Neva Left'' (2017) * ''Bible of Love'' (2018) * ''I Wanna Thank Me'' (2019) * ''From tha Streets 2 tha Suites'' (2021) * ''The Algorithm (Snoop Dogg album)'' (2021) * ''BODR'' (2022) ;Collaboration albums * ''Tha Eastsidaz (album)'' with Tha Eastsidaz (2000) * ''Duces 'n Trayz: The Old Fashioned Way'' with Tha Eastsidaz (2001) * ''The Hard Way (213 album)'' with 213 (2004) * ''Mac & Devin Go to High School (soundtrack)'' with Wiz Khalifa (2011) * ''7 Days of Funk'' with 7 Days of Funk (2013) * ''Royal Fam'' with Tha Broadus Boyz (2013) * ''Cuzznz'' with Daz Dillinger (2016) ==Filmography== {| class="wikitable" |- style="background:#ccc; text-align:center;" ! colspan="4" style="background: LightSteelBlue;" | Films |- style="background:#ccc; text-align:center;" !
