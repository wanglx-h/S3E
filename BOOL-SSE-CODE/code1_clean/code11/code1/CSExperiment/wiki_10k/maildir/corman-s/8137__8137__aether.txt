'''Aether''' was the God of light in Greek mythology. He was the son of Erebus and Nyx. Aether is one of the Greek primordial deities, the first-born elementals. Damascius says that Aether, Erebus and Chaos (mythology) were siblings, and the offspring of Chronos (Father Time). According to Epiphanius, the world began as a cosmic egg, encircled by Time and Inevitability (most likely Chronos and Ananke (mythology)) in serpent fashion. Together they constricted the egg, squeezing its matter with great force, until the world divided into two hemispheres. After that, the atoms sorted themselves out. The lighter and finer ones floated above and became the Bright Air (Aether and/or Ouranos) and the rarefied Wind (Chaos), while the heavier and dirtier atoms sank and became the Earth (Gaia (mythology)) and the Ocean (Pontos and/or Oceanus).
