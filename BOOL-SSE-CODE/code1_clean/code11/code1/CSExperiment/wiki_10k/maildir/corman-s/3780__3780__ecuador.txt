This center was, together with the historic centre of Kraków in Poland, the first to be declared World Heritage Site by UNESCO on 18 September 1978. The Historic Centre of Quito is in the center south of the capital on an area of 320hectares (790acres), and is considered one of the most important historic areas in Latin America.There are about 130 monumental buildings (which hosts a variety of pictorial art and sculpture, mostly of religious inspired in a multi-faceted range of schools and styles) and 5,000 properties registered in the municipal inventory of heritage properties. ===Presidential Palace=== File:Carondelet - Quito.JPG Carondelet Palace (Spanish: Palacio de Carondelet) is the seat of government of the Republic of Ecuador in the historical center of Quito. Axis is the nerve of the public space known as Independence Square or Plaza Grande (colonial name), around which were built in addition the Archbishop's Palace, the Municipal Palace, the Hotel Plaza Grande and the Metropolitan Cathedral. The history of this emblematic building dating back to colonial times, around 1570, with the acquisition of the former royal houses in the city of Quito During the Republican era, almost all the presidents (constitutional, internees and dictators) have dispatched from this building, which is the seat of Government of the Republic of Ecuador. In addition to the administrative units in the third level of the Palace is the presidential residence, a luxurious colonial-style apartment in which they live the President and his family. Rafael Correa, president since 2007, considering that Carondelet Palace and its agencies are Ecuadoran heritages, converted the presidential compound into a museum accessible to all who wish to visit it. To this end, areas were organized to locate objects within their cultural contexts to make them accessible to the world. Several rooms and spaces within the palace are used for this purpose. ===Church of La Compañía de Jesús=== File:La Compañía en Quito Ecuador.JPG Construction began in 1605, with Mastrilli laying the first stone. The building was not completed until 1765. La Compañía is among the best-known churches in Quito because of its large central nave, which is profusely decorated with gold leaf, gilded plaster and wood carvings. Inspired by two Roman Jesuit churches—the Chiesa del Gesù and the Chiesa di Sant'Ignazio di Loyola—La Compañía is one of the most significant works of Spanish Baroque architecture in South America. ===Independence Square=== File:Independence Square Historic Center - Plaza de la Independencia en Quito Ecuador.JPG Also known as Big Square (Spanish: Plaza de la Independencia, Plaza Grande). Historic public square of Quito (Ecuador), in the heart of the old city. This is the central square of the city and one of the symbols of the executive power of the nation. Its main feature is the monument to the independence heroes of August 10, 1809, date remembered as the First Cry of Independence of the Royal Audience of Quito from Spanish monarchy. The environment of the square is flanked by the Carondelet Palace, the Metropolitan Cathedral, the Archbishop's Palace, the Municipal Palace and the Plaza Grande Hotel. ===Church of San Fransisco=== The ''Iglesia y Monasterio de San Francisco'' (English: Church and Monastery of St. Francis), colloquially known as El San Francisco, is a colonial-styled church and monastery in Quito, Ecuador. Construction of the building began a few weeks after the founding of the city in 1534 and ended in 1604. The founder of the church was Franciscan missionary Jodoco Ricke. The building's construction began around 1550, sixteen years after Quito was founded by Spanish conquistadors, and was finished in approximately 1680. The building was officially inaugurated in 1605. It is not known who designed the original plans for the complex, though the most-accepted theory is that they were sent from Spain, based on the topographical study of Ricke and Gosseal. It is also possible that architects came from Spain for the construction of the monastery, or that Ricke and Gosseal managed the entire construction. File:Plaza de San Francisco en Centro histórico de Quito, Ecuador.JPG File:Stfrancisquito.JPG ===Church of El Sagrario=== In colonial times, the Church of El Sagrario was one of the largest architectural marvels of Quito. The construction is of the Italian Renaissance style and was built in the late 17th century. It has a screen that supports its sculptures and decorations. This structure was built by Bernardo de Legarda. Its central arch leads to a dome decorated with frescoes of biblical scenes featuring archangels, work by Francisco Albán. The altarpiece was gilded by Legarda. It is on Calle García Moreno, near the cathedral. ===Church of Santo Domingo=== File:Iglesia de Santo Domingo, Quito - 2.jpg Although they arrived in Quito in 1541, in 1580 the Dominicans started to build their temple, using the plans and direction of Francisco Becerra. The work was completed in the first half of the 17th century. Inside the church are valuable structures, such as the neo-Gothic main altar. This was placed in the late 19th century by Italian Dominicans. The roof of the Mudéjar style church features paintings of martyrs of the Order of Saint Dominic. The roof of the nave is composed of a pair and knuckle frame, coated inside by pieces of tracery. In the museum on the north side of the lower cloister are wonderful pieces of great Quito sculptors such as the Saint Dominic de Guzmán by Father Carlos, the Saint John of God by Caspicara, and the Saint Thomas Aquinas by Legarda. Another Baroque piece that stands is the Chapel of Nuestra Señora del Rosario, which is a recognizable feature of the architecture of Quito. This chapel was built beside the church, in the gospel side. In this was founded the largest fraternity in the city of Quito. ===El Panecillo=== El Panecillo is a hill in the middle west of the city at an altitude of about 3,016metres (9,895ft) above sea level. A monument to the Virgin Mary is on top of El Panecillo and is visible from most of the city of Quito. In 1976, the Spanish artist Agustín de la Herrán Matorras was commissioned by the religious order of the Oblates to build a 41metres (135ft)–tall aluminum monument of a madonna, which was assembled on a high pedestal on the top of Panecillo. === The Quito School === The Quito School originated in the school of Artes y Oficios, founded in 1552 by the Franciscan priest Jodoco Ricke, who together with Friar Pedro Gocial transformed the San Andrés seminary, where the first indigenous artists were trained. As a cultural expression, it is the result of a long process of acculturation between indigenous peoples and Europeans, and it is one of the richest expressions of miscegenation (''mestizaje'') and of syncretism, in which the participation of the vanquished Indian is seemingly of minor importance as compared to the dominant European contribution. File:Retrato de una señora principal con su negra esclava por Vicente Albán.jpgThe Quito School (''Escuela Quiteña'') is an artistic tradition that developed in the territory of the Royal Audience of Quito, from Pasto and Popayán in the north to Piura and Cajamarca in the south, during the colonial period (1542-1824). This artistic production was one of the most important activities in the economy of the Royal Audience of Quito. The major artists of the Quito School are the sculptors Bernardo de Legarda , Manuel Chili (Caspicara) and Miguel Angel Tejada Zambrado and the painters Fray Pedro Gosseal, Fray Pedro Bedón, Nicolás Javier Goríbar, Hernando de la Cruz, Miguel de Santiago, Manuel de Samaniego ===Basilica del Voto Nacional=== File:Basílica del Voto Nacional, Quito - 4.jpgThe Basilica of the National Vow is a Roman Catholic Church church (building) in the historic center of Quito, Ecuador. It is sometimes also called the Catedral Consagración de Jesús or the Basílica de San Juan. It is the largest neo-Gothic basilica in the Americas. The basilica arose from the idea, proposed by father Julio Matovelle in 1883, of building a monument as a perpetual reminder of the consecration of Ecuador to the Sacred Heart, President Luis Cordero issued the decree on July 23, 1883, and it was carried out by president José María Plácido Caamaño on March 5, 1884. The congress, in accordance with the year's budget, designated 12,000 pesos for the construction - 1,000 pesos per month, beginning in 1884. By the decree of July 3, 1885, the fourth Quitense Provincial Council turned the construction of the basilica into a religious commitment in the name of the country. The basilica remains technically "unfinished." & local legend says that when the Basílica is completed, the end of the world will come. ===Metropolitan Cathedral === Construction began in 1562, seventeen years after the diocese of Quito was created (1545) and in the heart of the historic city and its status as the main church of the city, is one of the largest religious symbols of spiritual value for the Catholic community in the city. ===Church of San Agustín=== It is one of the seven monumental churches of the 16th and 17th centuries whose main portico was built on stone in the Spanish Baroque architecture style. The church includes a small Atrium (architecture) (decorated by a large stone cross), an inside yard with a large garden and a large session hall where the frayers held dissertations or "capitulations" of faith. The cloister and convent have a separate entrance which leads to the garden. The bell tower reaches a high of twenty-two meters (seventy feet) and houses two bronze bells of the period. ==Climate== Ecuador is a country of variety. Its climate and landscape varies from one end of the country to the other. However, it is more hot and humid along the coast and in the Amazon Rainforest jungle lowlands than it is in the mountains.

In addition to the mainland, Ecuador owns the Galápagos Islands. This is what the country is best known for. Ecuador has 1,600 bird species and 38 more Endemism in the Galápagos. In addition to over 16,000 species of plants, the country has 106 endemic reptiles, 138 endemic amphibians, and 6,000 species of butterfly. The Galápagos Islands are famous as the place of birth of Darwin's Theory of Evolution. They are a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Many different kinds of potatoes and corn are grown in Ecuador. There are also large banana farms. On the coast, many people eat seafood and fish. '''Cuy''' is a famous indigenous food that means guinea pig. ==Economy== Besides gold, oil is one of Ecuador's natural resources. Ecuador used to have its own currency called the sucre, which was in use from 1884 until 2000. Since then, the country uses the United States dollar for money, but its coins (not the banknotes) are different from those in the United States. == Rights of Nature == Ecuador is the first country in the world to have the Environmental law guaranteed in its Constitution, a landmark achievement that was formalized in 2008. This groundbreaking legal framework recognizes nature as a subject of rights, granting it the legal standing to exist, persist, and regenerate its vital cycles. The inclusion of these rights reflects Ecuador's commitment to sustainable development and environmental protection, positioning the country at the forefront of global environmental policy. The recognition of the Rights of Nature in Ecuador’s Constitution is particularly significant given the country’s vast biodiversity and the presence of one of the highest concentrations of rivers per square kilometer in the world. These legal provisions are designed to protect Ecuador’s Natural resource and ensure that development activities do not compromise the ecological balance. As a recent energy powerhouse focusing on sustainable energy sources, Ecuador has integrated these environmental rights into its broader national strategy. This legal innovation aligns with the country's efforts to safeguard its diverse ecosystems, from the Amazon rainforest to the volcanic highlands and the unique Galápagos Islands. By embedding the Rights of Nature in its legal system, Ecuador not only protects its natural heritage but also sets an example for other nations in recognizing and preserving the intrinsic value of the environment. ==Gallery of the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador== File:Opuntia echios - Santa Fe, Galapagos.jpg|Prickly pear cactus and Swallow-tailed Gulls on Santa Fe Island File:Floreana4.jpg|Floreana (Charles or Santa María) Island in the Galapagos File:Galapagos2007--01--07-13-07.JPG|Tourists with sea lions at the beach at San Cristóbal Island File:Rabida Island - panorama.jpg|Rábida Island File:Elizabeth Bay -Isabela Island -birds.jpg|Isabela Island, Blue-footed Boobies and a Galápagos Penguin at Elizabeth Bay File:SulaNebouxi.jpg|Blue-footed booby File:A Galapagos Land Iguana on the North Seymour Island in the Galapagos photo by Alvaro Sevilla Design.JPG|A Galapagos Land Iguana on the North Seymour Island in the Galapagos File:Blue footed Booby on North Seymour Island Galapagos photo by Alvaro Sevilla Design.JPG|(Sula nebouxii) Blue footed Booby on North Seymour Island Galapagos File:North Seymour Island in the Galapagos about to land on shore photo by Alvaro Sevilla Design.JPG|North Seymour Island File:North Seymour Island in the Galapagos bird in flight photo by Alvaro Sevilla Design.JPG|(Fregata magnificens) The Magnificent Frigatebird on North Seymour Island File:North Seymour Island Galapagos Seal photo with baby by Alvaro Sevilla Design.JPG|Seal with baby on North Seymour Island.
