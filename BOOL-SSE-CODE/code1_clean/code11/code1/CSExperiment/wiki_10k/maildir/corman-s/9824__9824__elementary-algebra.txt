Subject: Elementary algebra
'''Elementary algebra''' is the most basic form of algebra taught to students. It is often one of the next areas of mathematics taught to students after arithmetic. While in arithmetic only numbers and operators like +, −, ×, and ÷ occur; in algebra, variables (like ''a'', ''x'', ''y'') are used to stand for numbers. This is useful because: * It lets people solve problems about "unknown" numbers. This means learning about equations and how to solve them (for example, "find a number ''x'' where 3x + 1 = 10"). * It allows the generalization of the rules from arithmetic. While some students understand that 3+4 = 4+3, it helps to prove that a + b = b + a for all ''a'' and ''b''. This makes algebra a good step to learning about wikt:abstract (learning general ideas from many examples). * It helps people understand and create Function (mathematics) relationships (also sometimes called cause and effect). An example of this is "if ''x'' tickets are sold, then the profit will be 3x - 10 dollars". These three are the main strands of elementary algebra. Elementary algebra is often used in many other subjects, like science, business, and building. Abstract algebra, a much more advanced topic, is generally taught late in college. ==Simple algebra problems== If an equation has only one number that is unknown it is sometimes easy to solve. The unknown number is called "x": :2x + 4 = 12. \, To solve a simple equation with one unknown amount Addition, Subtraction, multiplication, or Division (mathematics) both sides of the equation by the same number in order to put the unknown amount, x, on one side of the equation. Once x is by itself on one side, use arithmetic to determine the amount on the other side of the equation. For example, by subtracting 4 from both sides in the equation above: :2x + 4 - 4 = 12 - 4 \, getting: :2x = 8 \, Dividing both sides by 2: :\frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2} \, getting: :x = 4. \, It may help to think of this equation as a see-saw or balance, what you do to one side, you must do to the other and your main aim is to get ''x'' by itself. == Definitions == 3x^2 - 2xy + c has the following components: File:algebraic equation notation.svg) 2 – coefficient 3 – addend 4 – Operation (mathematics) 5 – constant term c – Constant (mathematics) x y – Variable (mathematics)s]] ==Notes== Category:Algebra
