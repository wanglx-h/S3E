He wrote or edited over 500 books and about 90,000 letters. Other subjects he wrote about were history, the Bible, literature, and sexuality. Many of Asimov's early writings were short stories published in cheap science fiction and fantasy magazines. Years later, most of them were collected and republished as collections. Well-known collections include ''I, Robot'', ''The Rest of the Robots'', ''Earth is Room Enough'' and ''The Early Asimov''. === Asimov's reading list === Asimov made a list of 15 of his science fiction books, which he advised should be read in this order: # ''I, Robot'' (1950). Alternatively, ''The Complete Robot'' (1982). # ''Caves of Steel'' (1954). # ''The Naked Sun'' (1957). # ''The Robots of Dawn'' (1983). # ''Robots and Empire'' (1985). # ''The Currents of Space'' (1952). # ''The Stars, Like Dust'' (1951). # ''Pebble in the Sky'' (1950). # ''Prelude to Foundation'' (1988). # ''Forward the Foundation'' (1993). # ''Foundation'' (novel) (1951). # ''Foundation and Empire'' (1952). # ''Second Foundation'' (1953). # ''Foundation's Edge'' (1982). # ''Foundation and Earth'' (1986). Numbers 1–5 are 'Robot' books; 6–8 are 'Galacticos Empire' books; 9–15 are Foundation series books.[http://www3.sympatico.ca/n.rieck/links/cool_sci_fi.html#asimov-suggested-reading-order 15-Book reading order as suggested by Asimov] From "Author's Note" of ''Prelude to Foundation'' Doubleday 1988 hardcover edition. Asimov's novels have influenced science fiction on television and movie. Especially his 'Three Laws of Robotics' is a lasting contribution to our thinking. # A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. # A robot must obey any orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. # A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law. == Beliefs == Although ethnically a Jew, Asimov was an atheist: :"I am an atheist, out and out. It took me quite a long time to say it. I've been an atheist for years and years, but somehow ... it was better to say one was a humanist or an agnostic".[http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov#General_sources Free Inquiry (Spring 1982). Wikiquote] == Death == When he had heart surgery in 1983, he received blood infected with HIV. He developed AIDS, and died of the effects of the medical condition in 1992. His widow did not speak of this until years later. == Related pages == * Arthur C.
