Subject: The Freecycle Network
'''The Freecycle Network''' ('''TFN''') is a global network of people who share and regiving items. They organise their network through the Internet. Freecycle is a place for people to meet. There are just two things people can do there. The first thing is this: A person can ask other people for an item. If someone has it, they can tell the person who wants it. The second thing is this: A person can give away an item. Sometimes many people want the item, and the donator has to choose just one person. == Other websites == *[http://www.freecycle.org/ Official website] *[http://finder.trashnothing.com Freecycle Group Finder] Category:Websites Category:Recycling
