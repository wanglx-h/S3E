Subject: Macrosociology
'''Macro-sociology''' is a way of looking at the earth of people in a broad way. It is "concerned with human societies". Macrosociology is considered one of the main foundations of sociology (contrast with micro-sociology). In sociology there are different levels of analysis. Macro-sociology is the analysis of either large collectivities (the city, the church) or, more abstractly, of social systems and social structures. (Dictionary of Sociology, 2000) With the perspective of macro-sociology, it is possible to better understand societies, culture, Group and Organization. Important representatives of macro-sociological theories are: * Karl Marx; who analyzed society from the perspective of class conflict between workers and owners. * Max Weber; who viewed society as rapidly modernizing and looked at the effects of this process, such as Bureaucracy. * Emile Durkheim; who viewed individual issues as reflective of greater social patterns, completing the first sociological study which linked suicide to societal trends. == References == * Category:Subfields of sociology
