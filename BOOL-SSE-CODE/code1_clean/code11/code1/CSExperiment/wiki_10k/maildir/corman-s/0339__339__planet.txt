Subject: Planet
A '''planet''' is a large object such as Venus (planet) or Earth that orbits a star. Planets do not make light but can reflection light. Planets are sphere (that is, ball-shaped), because their gravity compresses them into a sphere. Jupiter (planet) is the biggest planet in the Solar System, while the smallest planet in the Solar System is Mercury (planet). Planets are shaped like a slightly squashed ball (called a spheroid). Objects that orbit planets are called Satellite (natural). A star and everything which orbits it are called a star system. There are eight planets in the Solar System. Pluto used to be called a planet, but in August 2006, the International Astronomical Union decided it was a dwarf planet instead. Because of its similar size to other things in space that were not planets. There are eight more known dwarf planets in the Solar System, 1 Ceres, 136199 Eris, 136472 Makemake, 136108 Haumea, 50000 Quaoar, 90482 Orcus, 225088 Gonggong, and 90377 Sedna. The name "planet" is from the Greek language word ''πλανήτης'' (''planetes''), meaning "wanderers", or "things that move". Until the 1990s, people only knew the planets in the Solar System. Since then 4,905 extrasolar planets (Extrasolar planet) have been discovered in 3,629 planetary systems (January 2022 data). The count includes 808 multi-planetary systems. Known exoplanets range in size from gas giants about twice as large as Jupiter down to just over the size of the Moon. About 100 of these planets are roughly the size as Earth. Nine of these orbit in the habitable zone of their star. Also extrasolar moons (moons orbiting extrasolar planets) have been observed.https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-022-01631-0 == Origin of the planets == The planets are made of elements that are very different from the Sun (which is mostly hydrogen).Charles H. Lineweaver 2001. An estimate of the age distribution of terrestrial planets in the Universe: quantifying metallicity as a selection effect. Icarus. '''151''' (2): 307–313. [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0012399]Williams J. 2010. The astrophysical environment of the solar birthplace.. ''Contemporary Physics''. '''51''' (5): 381–396. [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ConPh..51..381W] The Sun is mostly made up of hydrogen, with some helium. Its energy comes from converting hydrogen to helium. In contrast, the planets are mostly made up of larger atoms and molecules which ''could not have come from the Sun''.Though the gas giants do have hydrogen: because their gravity is strong enough to hang on to the small molecules. The materials of planets must have come from another source or sources. Those sources were atoms made in earlier supernovae explosions near the Sun's path as it moved through its part of the Milky Way. The material captured by the Sun's gravity formed the planets. The same thing happened in other planetary systems in the galaxy.Safronov, Viktor Sergeevich 1972. ''Evolution of the protoplanetary cloud and formation of the Earth and the planets''. Israel Program for Scientific Translations. ISBN 0-7065-1225-1 The gas giants are made up of hydrogen gas like the Sun, plus (at their centres) metallic elements like the terrestrial planets. == Historical names == File:Planets2013.svg]] The planets in the Solar System have names of Greek mythology or Roman mythology gods, except for Earth, because people did not think Earth was a planet in old times. However, Earth is occasionally referred by the name of a Roman god: ''Terra''. Other languages, for example Chinese language, use different names. Moons also have names of gods and people from classical mythology. The names of the moons of Uranus are from the theatre written by Shakespeare. === Planets === Here is a list of planets in the Solar System from the closest to the farthest {| class="wikitable " style="text-align: left;" !

Some examples of smaller objects are asteroids, comets, and trans-Neptunian objects. There are three types of planets in the Solar System. They are: * Terrestrial planet: These are planets that are like Earth. They are mostly made up of Rock (geology). They include: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars. * Giant planet: These planets are much bigger than our home planet. They are mostly made of gas or volatile. They include: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune. ** ''Gas giant'': These giant planets are mostly made of gas. They include: Jupiter, Saturn. ** ''Ice giant'': These giant planets are mostly made of volatiles. They include: Uranus, Neptune. * Ice planet: These planets are mostly made of volatiles. They include: Pluto, Orcus, Haumea, Makemake, Quaoar, Sedna, Gonggong, Eris. Many objects in the Solar System that are not planets are also "icy". Examples are the icy moons of the outer planets of the Solar System (like Triton (moon)). ==Related pages== * Formation and evolution of the Solar System * List of planets * Ice dwarfs ==References== Category:Planets Category:Observational astronomy
