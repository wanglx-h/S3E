Image:Oliven V1.jpg '''Olive oil''' is a vegetable oil. It is made by getting the juice of the fruits of the olive tree. These are called Olive (fruit). The oil is used in cooking, as well as cosmetics, traditional medicine, and as a fuel for oil lamps. Refined olive oil uses heat and chemicals to get the fat out of the olives.
