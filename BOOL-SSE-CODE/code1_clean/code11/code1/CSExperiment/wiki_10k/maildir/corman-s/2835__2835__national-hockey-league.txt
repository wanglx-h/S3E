| current_season = 2024–25 NHL season | champion = Florida Panthers(2nd title) | most_champs = Montreal Canadiens(25 titles)While the Montreal Canadiens have won 24 Stanley Cups, this does not equal its number of NHL championships, as the Stanley Cup predates the NHL and was an inter-league championship prior to 1926. The Canadiens won a Stanley Cup championship in 1916 Stanley Cup Finals as a member of the National Hockey Association, and 23 as a member of the NHL. Montreal also won the NHL championship twice without winning the Stanley Cup: in 1919 Stanley Cup Finals when the Spanish flu cancelled the Stanley Cup finals against the Seattle Metropolitans of Pacific Coast Hockey Association and in 1925 Stanley Cup Finals when they lost in the Stanley Cup finals to the Western Hockey League (1952–1974)'s Victoria Cougars. | logo = | pixels = 190px | sport = Ice hockey | founded = ,Montreal, Canada | inaugural = 1917–18 NHL season | commissioner = Gary Bettman | headquarters = Sixth AvenueNew York City, New York (state) 10036. | teams = 32 | countries = Canada (7 teams)United States (25 teams) | continent = | TV = | NHL on TNT | NHL Network (American TV channel) | '''International:''' | List of current National Hockey League broadcasters#International broadcasters }} | website = [https://www.nhl.com/ NHL.com] }} '''The National Hockey League''' or NHL, is the highest-level ice hockey league in the world. It has 32 teams - 7 from Canada and 25 from the United States. The championship trophy is the Stanley Cup. The NHL were founded in 1917. There were five original teams in 1917: * Montreal Canadiens * Montreal Wanderers * Ottawa Senators (original) (later St. Louis Eagles; not related to the current Ottawa Senators) * Quebec Bulldogs (later Hamilton Tigers) * Toronto Maple Leafs (later St. Patricks, then Maple Leafs) They played 22 games a year. The Wanderers had to stop playing in the first year because their arena burned down. Over the years some teams died out, and others were created: the Boston Bruins, New York Americans, Montreal Maroons, Pittsburgh Pirates (later Philadelphia Quakers), New York Rangers, Chicago Black Hawks and Detroit Cougars (later Falcons, then Red Wings). Some teams folded during the Great Depression, so by 1942 there were only six teams: * Boston Bruins * Chicago Blackhawks * Detroit Red Wings * Montreal Canadiens * New York Rangers * Toronto Maple Leafs There were only these six teams for 25 years, so they became known as the "Original Six". By the 1940s, they were playing 50 games a year, but this increased slowly to 80 games by the 1970s. In 1967, the league increased to 12 teams. By 1979 it had 21 teams, and today it has 32. Some of the teams that no longer exist are the Oakland Seals, Minnesota North Stars (now the Dallas Stars), Winnipeg Jets (now the dormant Arizona Coyotes), Kansas City Scouts (which became the Colorado Rockies and are now the New Jersey Devils), Hartford Whalers (now the Carolina Hurricanes), Quebec Nordiques (now the Colorado Avalanche) and Atlanta Thrashers (now the current Winnipeg Jets). Today they play 82 games a year, plus four rounds of playoffs. The players make a lot of money (many make over a million dollars a year). Because they could make so much money, many Europeans came over to North America to play in the NHL. Today almost all the world's best hockey players are in the NHL. ==List of teams== {| class="wikitable" style="width:100%; text-align:left" |- ! style="background:white; align=center"|Division ! style="background:white; align=center"|Team !
