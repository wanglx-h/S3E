The '''omul''' (''Coregonus migratorius'') is a kind of fish. It belongs to the same family as the trout and the salmon. It only lives in Lake Baikal and the rivers around it (the Angara for example. It is very typical for that region of Siberia). Omul considered a food delicacy and can be eaten n many ways. Local people consume it boiled, fried smoked, and freshly salted. The Omul normally fished using seine nets and fishing nets, yet during early spring, it can be caught using a fishing road. ==References== Category:Salmoniformes Category:Siberia Category:Freshwater fish Category:Edible fish
