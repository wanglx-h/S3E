It is usually eaten in the morning. The word comes from two other words; ":wikt:broken" ("end") and Fasting ("not eating for a long time"). Definition: [1463] from break (v.) + fast (n.). Cf. Fr. déjeuner "to breakfast," from L. dis-jejunare "to break the fast." People around the world eat different things for breakfast: * In the United States, people usually eat Pancake, Waffle, toast, Egg (food) or Bagel for breakfast. * In Canada, people usually eat Bacon, fried Potato, maple-infused beans, eggs, toast, pancakes and maple syrup or hot oatmeal for breakfast. * In the United Kingdom a large breakfast was often, and still is sometimes, served. Usually this would be bread, tea, Egg (food), bacon, ham, fruits, baked beans on toast and sometimes vegetables. This pattern of heavy eating has greatly changed in recent years. Most people do not do manual work nowadays.Alan Davidson and Tom Jaine 2006. ''The Oxford companion to food''. Oxford University Press. * In France, people usually eat a very light meal; often bread and coffee with milk. Again, this depends on what kind of work is done (usually by the father of the household). * In Asia, most people eat rice instead of bread. They also sometimes eat porridge. == References == == Related pages == *Bacon and eggs *Diet (nutrition) Category:Meals
