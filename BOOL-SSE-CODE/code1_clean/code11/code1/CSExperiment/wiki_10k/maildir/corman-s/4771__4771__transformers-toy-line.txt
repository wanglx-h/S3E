Subject: Transformers (toy line)
'''Transformers''' are robots that turn into other things. Usually they turn into vehicles, like cars or jet aircraft. Transformers started in 1984 as a toy line, but then an animated series and a comic book were made. In 1986 a movie came out. In 2002 a new series and story line called Transformers Armada came out. This was followed by two more shows, Energon and Cybertron. Transformers is about different things sometimes. Usually it is about the heroic Autobots fighting the evil Decepticons. The Autobots are usually led by Optimus Prime. The Decepticons are led by Megatron. ==Transformer universe== The '''Dynasty of Primes''' were the first seven Primes in Cybertronian history. They were on a quest to harvest Energon using the Star Harvester. In some documents of history, they were loosely known as "The Thirteen". The origins of the transformers vary throughout the media. It is generally accepted that the original transformers, the 13 primes, were created by Primus, the god of the Transfomers, to stop Unicron, the dark god. However, in the original series, the Quintessons claim to have created the Transformers, though in modern lore they have been accepted to be lying. ==Other websites== * *There is also another Transformers page on Wikipidia: Transformers Category:Animated television series Category:Toys Category:Transformers (franchise)
