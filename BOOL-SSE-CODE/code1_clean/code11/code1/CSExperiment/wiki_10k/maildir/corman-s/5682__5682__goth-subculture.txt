:''Goth can also mean a member of a Goths'' File:Viona ielegems.jpg A '''goth''' is a word usually used to describe a person who listens to gothic rock and/or dresses in a goth style clothing. Goths often wear black and unusual jewelry. Both goth men and goth women often wear make-up. The ''goth subculture'' originated in the early 1980s among fans of the first gothic rock group, Bauhaus (band). The word goth comes from the word ''Gothic'' which actually means ''gloomy'' or ''dark''. This meaning of the word comes from ''gothic fiction'', a type of literature popular during the late 18th and early 19th century. People who call themselves a goth are those who live up the meaning of the name through wearing clothes or putting on makeup that is in colors that represent death, decay, or gloominess, such as the color black, deathly white face makeup, dark blood red colors, or the tones of the color puce. Goths wear normal black clothes and mix them with other colors to make a new look. Goth people are often mistaken to be emo or punk because of the everyday stereotype.
