Subject: List of states with limited recognition
In international law a political entity needs to fulfill different criteria to become an independence state: One of these criteria is that other states must recognize it as a state. If more states recognize it, becoming a ''de jure'' sovereign state will be easier. Many of the territories listed below broke off (separatism themselves) from their original parent state, and so they are often referred to as "break-away" states, that are ''de facto'' independent and are not recognized by other states or are only recognized by few states. They may have some military protection and informal diplomatic representation abroad. Another state may help them avoid forced reincorporation into its original state. == UN member states not recognized by at least 1 UN member state == * The '''Armenia''' was independent since 1991 after the Dissolution of the Soviet Union. The Republic of Armenia is not recognized by one UN member state, Pakistan, which has a position of supporting Azerbaijan since the First Nagorno-Karabakh War. * The '''Cyprus''' is not recognized by one UN member state, Turkey and one non-UN member state, Northern Cyprus, due to the ongoing Cyprus dispute over the island. Northern Cyprus claims the northeastern half of the island. * The '''People's Republic of China''' is the more widely recognized of the two claimant governments of China, the other being the Republic of China (ROC, also known as Taiwan). The United Nations recognized the ROC as the sole representative of China until 1971 when it decided to give this recognition to the PRC instead (see United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758). The PRC and the ROC do not recognize each other's statehood, and each enforces its own version of the One-China policy so that no state can recognize both of them at the same time. The states that recognize the ROC (14 UN members and the Holy See as of 20 September 2019) regard it as the sole legitimate government of China and therefore do not recognize the PRC. Bhutan is the only UN member state that has never explicitly recognized either the PRC or the ROC. The Republic of China considers itself to be the sole legitimate government of China (including Taiwan), and therefore claims exclusive sovereignty over all territory controlled by the PRC. * The '''Israel''' is International recognition of Israel. The Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) which enjoys majority international recognition as the sole representative of the Palestinian people, recognized Israel in 1993. In January 2018, the Palestinian Central Council voted to suspend recognition of Israel, but the decision has yet to be acted upon. The Palestine considers itself to be the legitimate government of the West Bank, much of which is under occupation. The Syria considers itself to be the legitimate government of the Golan Heights, a territory which Israel claims with limited recognition. * The '''North Korea''' (North Korea) is not recognized by three UN members: France, Japan and South Korea; and one non-UN member, Republic of China. South Korea considers itself to be the sole legitimate government of Korea, and claims all territory controlled by North Korea. * The '''South Korea''' (South Korea) is not recognized by one UN member, North Korea. North Korea considers itself to be the sole legitimate government of Korea and claims all territory controlled by South Korea === UN observer states not recognized by at least one UN member === * The '''State of Palestine''' is a de jure sovereign state in Western Asia officially governed by the Palestine Liberation Organization and claiming the West Bank and Gaza Strip with Jerusalem as the designated capital; in practice, however, only partial administrative control is held over the 167 "islands" in the West Bank, and Gaza is ruled by a rival government (Hamas). Israel regards the area claimed by Palestine as 'disputed' territory (that is, territory not legally belonging to any state). Israel gained control of the Palestinian territories as a result of the Six-Day War in 1967 but has never formally annexed them. The State of Palestine (commonly known as Palestine) was Palestinian declaration of independence in 1988 by the Palestine Liberation Organization, which is recognized by a majority of UN member states and the UN itself as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. Since the end of the First Intifada, the Israeli government has gradually moved its armed forces and settlers out of certain parts of Palestine's claimed territory, while still maintaining varying degrees of control over most of it. The Palestinian National Authority, which performs limited internal government functions over parts of Palestine, was established in 1994. In 2007, the Fatah-Hamas conflict resulted in competing governments with Fatah exercising authority exclusively over the West Bank and enjoying majority recognition from UN member states, and a separate Hamas leadership governance of the Gaza Strip exclusively over the Gaza area (except for a short period from 2014 to 2016). Palestine is currently International recognition of the State of Palestine member states, the Holy See, and the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. The remaining UN member states, including Israel, do not recognize the State of Palestine. The United Nations designates the claimed Palestinian territories as 'occupied' by Israel and accorded Palestine non-member observer state status in 2012. Palestine also has membership in the Arab League, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, and UNESCO. == Partially recognized states with ''de facto'' control over their territory == * '''Abkhazia''' in Georgia (country) is a self-declared and mostly functioning independent state. It is recognized by the Russian Federation, Nicaragua and Venezuela. The country is between the Caucasus and the Black Sea. It is recognized by the Georgian government as a part of northwestern Georgia (country). During the Soviet Union, Abkhazia became a part of Georgia in 1931. It was an autonomous republic within Soviet Georgia. The Abkhazian Soviets said it was Independence from Georgia in 1992. A short war was fought from 1992 through 1994. In June 1994, a ceasefire ended the fighting and left Abkhazia outside the control of Georgia's central government. United Nations member states that are not recognized by all the other UN members are not listed here. (For example, Foreign relations of Israel do not recognize Israel.) * The '''Republic of China''' controls only Taiwan and some of the list of islands of the Republic of China since losing the Chinese Civil War in 1949. It lost most of its diplomatic recognition and China and the United Nations to the People's Republic of China in October 25, 1971 by UN General Assembly Resolution 2758. It is now Foreign relations of the Republic of China#List of countries with diplomatic relations with the ROC. It has ''de facto'' (all but in name) relations with most countries through institutions such as the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Offices. (''See political status of Taiwan''). * The '''Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus''' was set up in northern Cyprus in 1975, following the Turkish intervention of Cyprus in 1974, in response to a coup d'état by the Greek military junta of 1967-1974 aiming at "Foreign relations of Greece#Enosis". It declared independence in 1983 and it is recognized only by Turkey. A Annan Plan for Cyprus to unify the two Cypriot states was accepted by the Republic, but rejected in a referendum by the Greek Cypriot community, citing security concerns. Further attempts at reunification have been unsuccessful. * '''South Ossetia''' in Georgia (country) is a self-declared and more or less functioning independent state with no international recognition from any other nation. After occupation of independent Georgia (country) by Bolshevist Russia in 1921 it became the South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast within Soviet Georgia (country). It proclaimed independence from Georgia in 1991, and a ceasefire was declared in 1992. == More unrecognized states with de facto control over their territory == * '''Somaliland''' (since 1991) is located in north west of Somalia. In May of 1991, north western clans declared an independent Republic of Somaliland that now includes five of the eighteen administrative regions of Somalia, corresponding to the British Somali Coast Protectorate which is located between Ethiopia, Djibouti, Puntland and the Gulf of Aden. Three regions of north Somalia claimed by Somaliland, Sool, Sanaag and Cayn are disputed with neighbouring Puntland in the north east.[http://www.nation.co.ke/news/africa/Puntland-and-Somaliland-leaders/1066-3316694-nyyej3z/index.html] * '''Transnistria''' '''(Pridnestrovie),''' also spelled Transdniestria, is the part of Moldova east of the river Dniester and (since 1990) a self-declared and more or less functioning independent state with no international recognition from any sovereign state. It has a majority Slavic peoples population, as opposed to majority Moldovans which Moldova has. Also known as the Dniester Republic, it has its own police, army, and currency and functions outside of the jurisdiction of Moldova, however, there is no sign of it becoming an internationally recognized country. == Partially recognized states largely under military occupation == * '''Western Sahara''' is a territory claimed and largely administered by Morocco since Spain abandoned the territory in 1976. The '''Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic''' controls Free Zone (region); it was proclaimed by the Front Polisario Front in 1976, is Foreign relations of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, and a full member of the African Union. Sovereignty is unresolved and the United Nations is attempting to hold a referendum on the issue through the mission MINURSO. The UN-administered Ceasefire has been in effect since September 1991. Western Sahara is on the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories. == Internationally administered territory with de facto recognition == * ''' Republic of Kosovo''' is recognized as an independent and sovereign country by 98 UN member states, including the U.S., 23 out of 28 EU members, etc. The International Court of Justice found that Kosovo's declaration of independence did not violate international law. == Historic unrecognized or partially recognized states with de facto control over their territory == === Europe === * '''Banat Republic''' (proclaimed in 1918).
