File:Course Channeltunnel.svg The '''Channel Tunnel''' (or '''Chunnel''') (French language: '''''le tunnel sous la Manche''''') is a long underwater tunnel between England and France that runs under the English Channel at the Strait of Dover. It is only for Railway. Some of the trains in the Channel Tunnel carry freight, including automobiles. Others, like the Eurostar, carry only passengers. The tunnel, which was once called the Eurotunnel, opened in 1994. It is 50 kilometres (31 miles) long and its deepest point is 75 metres (250 feet) beneath the surface. It connects Folkestone, Kent in the United Kingdom to Calais in northern France. This has reduced travel time between London and Paris to a little over two hours with High-speed rail. == Other websites == * [http://www.eurotunnel.com EuroTunnel.com] Category:Tunnels Category:Seven Wonders of the Modern World Category:Buildings and structures in France Category:Transport in England Category:Transport in France Category:Hauts-de-France Category:1994 establishments in Europe Category:Buildings and structures in Kent
