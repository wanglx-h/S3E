The capital (city) of Minnesota is Saint Paul, Minnesota. The largest city is Minneapolis. Over 3,000,000 people live in the two cities and the suburbs that surround it, which are separated by the Mississippi River. They are known as the Minneapolis-Saint Paul. Minnesota borders the Provinces and territories of Canada of Manitoba and Ontario and the U.S. state of North Dakota, Wisconsin, Iowa, and South Dakota. Minnesota is divided into 87 counties. Minnesota became a state on May 11, 1858. It was the 32nd state in the United States of America. The name Minnesota is Sioux (a Native American language) for "sky-tinted water" or "cloudy water". Eagle Mountain is the highest point in Minnesota. The state bird is the Common Loon. Minnesota has a humid continental climate. The winters in Minnesota are long and severe. Hence the state has a short growing season. During the summer, the south of the state is hot; the north is warm. In the 1984 United States presidential election, Minnesota was the only state that voted for Walter Mondale. Minnesota also has an exclave, the Northwest Angle, housing the northernmost point in the contiguous United States. ==Flag== The Minnesota state flag was mostly not changed from 1893-2024.
