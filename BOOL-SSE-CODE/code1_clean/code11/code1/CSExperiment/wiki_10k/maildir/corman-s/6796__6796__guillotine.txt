File:Exécution de Marie Antoinette le 16 octobre 1793.jpg's execution on 16 October 1793]] The '''guillotine''' is a machine used to Execution people by decapitation (chopping off their heads). A guillotine is made of a heavy blade attached to a rack, which moves up and down on a vertical frame. When the executioner releases the rack, it falls and the blade cuts the convict's head off. == History == Machines like the guillotine were first invented in the Middle Ages, and were used throughout Europe. For example, Scotland used a machine called the "Scottish Maiden". Such machines were seldom used in France, until the French Revolution of 1789. Instead, aristocrats were executed by beheading and ordinary criminals by Hanging (death). The guillotine became the only legal way to execute someone in France. The guillotine was used because it caused a quick death. Everyone, rich or poor, died the same way, no matter what social class. The guillotine was commonly used in France (including French colonial empire), and in Switzerland, Italy, Belgium, Germany, Austria, and Sweden. Today, all of these countries have abolished (legally stopped) the death penalty. The guillotine is no longer used. == French Revolution == The guillotine was the main instrument of execution. Thousands of people in the French Revolution died by the guillotine, including King and Queen Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. Maximilien Robespierre executed them and about 16,000 other people with the guillotine in the Reign of Terror. On July 28th 1794, Robespierre himself became the last victim.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQmjXM4VK2U == The invention of the guillotine == === Joseph Guillotin === File:Anonymous - Portrait de Joseph-Ignace Guillotin (1738-1814), médecin et homme politique. - P1052 - Musée Carnavalet (cropped).jpg File:090306entiere.jpg. He was a helper of the executioner in French Algeria.]] The guillotine is named after a French people medical doctor, Joseph-Ignace Guillotin. Guillotin was against the death penalty. Realising he could not stop the death penalty, Guillotin instead tried to think of a quicker, less painful way of executing people. On October 10, 1789, he suggested using a machine to do all the executions. The actual guillotine was designed by another doctor, Antoine Louis. Guillotin did not help much with the design, but his name went down in history. Against Guillotin's wishes, the new machine quickly became known as the ''Guillotine''. Guillotin regretted this until death in 1814. === Design === The design for a quick, painless, decapitation machine was given to Tobias Schmidt, a Germany engineer. Schmidt built the first guillotine and tested it, on animals at first, but later on dead humans. It was made of two fourteen-foot uprights joined by a crossbar, whose inside edges were grooved and greased with fat; the weighted blade was either straight, or curved like an axe. The system was started by a rope and pulley, while the whole construction was set up on a platform. The first execution was in 1792. == Later use == The guillotine was still the only legal way to execute a person in France until 1979, when France stopped using the death penalty. In Nazi Germany, the guillotine was used to kill prisoners sentenced for serious crimes like murder, treason, or conspiracy against the government. == References == A guillotine was last used in West Germany in 1949 and East Germany in 1961. The last person guillotined was the Tunisian murderer Hamida Djandoubi in 1977. Category:History Category:Capital punishment
