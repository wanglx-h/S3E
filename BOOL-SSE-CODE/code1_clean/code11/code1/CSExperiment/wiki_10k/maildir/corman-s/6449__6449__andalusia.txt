The territory is divided into eight Provinces of Spain: Province of Almería, Cádiz (province), Córdoba (Spanish province), Granada (province), Huelva (province), Jaén (Spanish province), Málaga (province) and Seville (province). Its capital is the city of Seville (Spanish: ''Sevilla''). Andalusia is in the south of the Iberian peninsula, just to the south of the autonomous communities of Extremadura and Castile-La Mancha; west of the autonomous community of Region of Murcia and the Mediterranean Sea; east of Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean; and north of the Mediterranean Sea and the Strait of Gibraltar. The small British overseas territories of Gibraltar shares a land border with the Andalusian province of Cádiz at the eastern end of the Strait of Gibraltar. ==History== The name Andalusia is the modern version of the Arabic language ''Al-Andalus'' (الأندلس), name used by the Muslim Moors for all of the territory of the Iberian Peninsula under their control. During that period, northern Iberian Peninsula was controlled by Christian kings and the southern Iberian Peninsula was controlled by Moors. In 711 CE, the Moors invaded the Iberian Peninsula, then controlled by Christians of Visigothic origin. By 719 the Moors conquered all of the peninsula except for a small area in the northern Pyrenees Mountains. The Moors used the name Al-Andalus for all of the territory of the Iberian Peninsula under their control. Christians in the north waged war for more than seven centuries against the Moors, gradually taking over more and more of the southern areas. This process of war is called the ''Reconquista'' (a Spanish and Portuguese language word meaning "to conquest again"). In the year 1492 under Spanish Inquisition, Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile of Spain retook the last stronghold in the southern area at Granada. In that same year, the majority Muslim Moors and Sephardi Jews were forced to leave Spain, other who want stay in Andalusia got baptized and became Catholic Christians. ==Symbols== The Andalusian coat of arms shows the figure of Hercules and two lions between the two pillars of Hercules that tradition puts on both sides of the Strait of Gibraltar. The words below read ''Andalucía por sí, para España y la Humanidad'' ("Andalusia by herself, for Spain and Humanity"). Over the two columns is an arch in the colors of the flag of Andalusia, with the Latin language words ''Dominator Hercules Fundator''. The official flag of Andalusia has three equal horizontal :wikt:stripe, colored green, white, and green respectively; the Andalusian coat of arms is on the central stripe. It was approved in a meeting in 1918 of Andalusian nationalism at Ronda, a city in the province of Málaga (province). File:Himno de Andalucía.ogg The national anthem of Andalusia was Musical composition by José del Castillo Díaz with lyrics by Blas Infante. The music was inspired by ''Santo Dios'', a Religion Folk music sung at harvest time by peasants. The national holiday, the ''Día de Andalucía'', is celebrated on 28 February. ==Geography== Andalusia is one of the 17 Spanish autonomous communities and is in the southwestern region of the European Union.

Although few people live there, this is not a particularly high Mountain range. # The Baetic Cordillera consists of the Parallel (geometry) mountain ranges of the Cordillera Penibética near the Mediterranean coast and the Cordillera Subbética to the north. The Cordillera Subbética is quite discontinuous, offering many passes that facilitate transportation, but the Penibético forms a strong barrier between the Mediterranean coast and the interior. The Sierra Nevada, part of the Cordillera Penibética in the Province of Granada, has the highest peaks in the Iberian peninsula: Mulhacén at and Veleta (Sierra Nevada) at . # Lower Andalusia or valley of the Guadalquivir is between these two mountainous areas. It is a nearly flat territory, open to the Atlantic Ocean in the southeast.
