'''DCPIP''' (its full name is ''2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol'') is a blue chemical used as a dye because when it is oxidized it is blue. Once DCPIP is reduction (chemistry) (by addition of electrons) it does not have a color anymore. This Chemical reaction can be reversed, and the Colorless DCPIP will turn blue again, when it is oxidation. == Purpose == DCPIP is often used to measure the electron transport chain in plants. It has a higher redox potential (electron affinity) than the Iron-Sulphur complex in Cytochrome and will therefore "steal" electrons from it. This means that cytochrome c does not receive them. The process cuts off the electron supply of :Category:Photosynthesis I. A common way to illustrate this change is by the addition of vitamin C solution. This reduces the 'jelly' by transforming it to a colourless mass. This experiment can be carried out to illustrate the effect of changing cell sizes on SA/V (Surface-area-to-volume ratio). This is known as Titration. == References == *Mathews, Ahern, Van Holde, ''Biochemistry'', Addison Wesley Longman Inc., 2000 pp534–5 Category:Organochlorides Category:Organonitrogen compounds
