The political powers are shared between the king Muhammad VI (the sixth) and the Head of the Government. The King is the head of state (Person in charge of the country) and the most important person. The people of Morocco vote for Members of Parliament to speak for them and to help make laws for them. The Council of Ministers defines what must be done. He makes all the important decisions. Today, the Head of Government is Abdelilah Benkirane. == Geography == Morocco is next to the countries of Algeria to its east, Mauritania to its south and Spain and Portugal as well as the United Kingdom at Gibraltar. The Mediterranean Sea lies to the north of Morocco, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. Morocco has a diverse geography from fertile plains, to forests, cold mountains, dry lands, and deserts. Most people live in areas close to the coast, or in fertile farms. Morocco has an area of 446,550km². Morocco also controls most of the Western Sahara which is 266.000km² big. The capital of Morocco is Rabat. About 1.2 million people live in Rabat. The biggest city in Morocco is however Casablanca, with nearly 4 million people living there. Both Rabat and Casablanca have large ports and industrial zones.

Moroccans are a Arabic speaking ethnic group of mixed Berber and Europe descent. The culture of Morocco is a reflection of various cultures that have come into contact with the country throughout the centuries, including neighbouring Mediterranean cultures. The official language of Morocco are Arabic language and Berber languages. French language is also very used in companies, universities, and in some TV channels. Morocco was part of the French colonial empire for 44 years. Some people in the north (close to Spain) speak Spanish language as well. Spain also occupied parts of Morocco before leaving them in 1956 and in 1975. Most educated Moroccans do not speak English language well, or do not know it at all. In the 21st century English is being taught to students in an increasing number of schools. Most Moroccans follow Islam as their religion as a result of the Arab conquest in the 7th century. There are very small numbers of Christians, Jews, and non-believers.
