During the American Revolution, George Washington and other Founding Fathers of the United States such as Benjamin Franklin, Robert Morris, and Patrick Henry used espionage networks. Cazorla, Frank, G. Baena, Polo, David, Reder Gadow, Marion (2019) The Governor Louis de Unzaga (1717-1793) Pioneer in the birth of the United States. Foundation. Malaga. pp. 77-84 The CIA was formed in 1947, after World War II. Many of the people who started the CIA, including General John K. Singlaub, had been part of the Office of Strategic Services. This was the United States' main Espionage agency during the war. In 1992, Saddam Hussein tried to kill former President of the United States George H. W. Bush, who was once Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, during a visit to Kuwait. The assassination plot failed. President Bill Clinton reacted by firing cruise missiles at Iraq's main intelligence headquarters. However, the missiles were fired at night, so the people who had planned the assassination were not killed; the building's Cleaner were. Since March 19, 2021, William Joseph Burns has been Director of the CIA. == Operations == CIA has many clandestine, (secret) operations. Some CIA employees have been killed during their work. Their names are on a CIA memorial with a star for them, but some of the names are still secret. The number of stars is deliberately inaccurate. The CIA also uses open sources to gather information. Analysts read foreign newspapers and watch foreign news broadcasting to learn information, which can be pieced together to make a conclusion. The CIA used to report to the President. After the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States, a reorganization made the CIA and other intelligence agencies report to a Director of National Intelligence. == Portrayals == The CIA has been featured in many television and Movie productions, including: * The American television show "The Agency" * The American television Miniseries "The Company" * The film "Spy Game" (starring Robert Redford and Brad Pitt) * "Night Flight to Moscow" (starring Yul Brenner) * "Scorpio" (starring Burt Lancaster) * "Clear and Present Danger" (starring Harrison Ford) * "The Recruit" (starring Colin Farrell and Al Pacino) * "Ice Station Zebra" * Several James Bond films (featuring the CIA agent Felix Leiter) == References == == Other websites == * [http://www.cia.gov/ Central Intelligence Agency website] Category:Central Intelligence Agency
