It originated from Galician-Portuguese, which was first spoken in Northwestern Iberia. It then spread south and split. During the early modern period, Portuguese also spread to Brazil and other parts of the world. == Where it is spoken == The Portuguese language is the third-most spoken western language (after English and Spanish). There are about 240 million native speakers, including the people of Portugal, Brazil, and Cape Verde (''Cabo Verde''). It is also an official language of Guinea-Bissau, Angola, Angola, Mozambique (''Moçambique''), Equatorial Guinea, and São Tomé and Príncipe (''São Tomé e Príncipe''), which have Portuguese as the ''lingua franca,'' but native languages are also spoken. It is also an official language in East Timor and Macau. Also, some enclaves in Asia, such as Goa and Daman and Diu, in India; Flores, Indonesia; and Malacca, Malaysia, have Portuguese-speakers, and it is a minority language in Venezuela, Canada, Uruguay, Namibia, Japan, Romania, Moldova, Turkey, and the United States. == Vocabulary == Portuguese and English language have words that mean the same and are similar as well. The words came from the same languages (usually Latin, Greek language or Arabic language). * Visão ''Vision'' * Informação ''Information'' * Confuso ''Confused'' * Baptismo ''Baptism'' * Artigo ''Article'' * Capital ''Capital'' * Total ''Total'' * Mapa ''Map'' * Problema ''Problem'' * História ''History'' Some English words come from Portuguese, such as tank (''tanque''), cacao (''cacau''), marmalade (marmelada from ''marmelo'' "quince"), caramel, molasses, mosquito, cobra, breeze (brisa), albino, coconut, zebra, pagoda, Mandarin, buccaneer, fetish, tapioca and commando. The Portuguese word ''parentes'' is similar to the English word "parents", but it means "relatives", and the Portuguese word to mean "parents" is ''pais''. == Sample phrases == * Hello! * Hi! * How are you? * I’m ok, thanks! * How are you? * Do you speak Portuguese? * I speak Portuguese. * I do not speak Portuguese. * I have to go, goodbye! * See you soon! * Bye! * What are you doing? * I'm 18 years old. == Different versions == Portuguese is the official language of all countries of the CPLP (''Comunidade dos países de língua portuguesa'', "Community of Portuguese Language Countries"). The Portuguese-speaking countries have more than 240 million people across the world. The CPLP was formed in 1996 with seven countries: Portugal, Brazil, Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, and São Tomé and Príncipe. East Timor joined in 2002. The CPLP nations speak Portuguese with different accents. In some regions of Brazil (the country has 81% of the world's Portuguese-speakers), ''tu'''("you" but used only to family and close friends) is not used as much as in Portugal. Also, regional slang can be found in different areas. The Portuguese Orthographic Agreement of 1990 (Acordo Ortográfico de 1990) tries to get rid of some of the differences in spelling. ==References== == Other websites == * [https://archive.org/details/PortugueseEssentialGrammar Amélia P.
