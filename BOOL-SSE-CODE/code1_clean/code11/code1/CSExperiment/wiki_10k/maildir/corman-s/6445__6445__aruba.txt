It is a country inside of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Unlike much of the Caribbean region, it has a dry climate and an arid, cactus-strewn landscape. This climate has helped tourism, because visitors to the island can reliably expect warm, sunny weather. Aruba broke off from the Netherlands Antilles in 1986, with plans of full independence by 1996. In 1990, that effort stopped at the request of the island people. Aruba is one of the four countries that form the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The other nations are the Netherlands, Curaçao and Sint Maarten. The citizens of these countries all share a single nationality: Dutch. About three quarters of the Aruban gross national product is earned through tourism or related activities. The island came into the news after U.S. high school student Natalee Holloway missing person on a graduation trip on May 30, 2005. Today, some refer to Aruba as "One Happy Island". == Geography == Aruba is a generally flat, riverless island. It is in the southern part of the Caribbean Sea. The western and southern beaches have white sandy beaches. They are generally protected from the ocean currents. This is one of the reasons Aruba is a popular tourist location. Together with Bonaire and Curaçao, Aruba forms a group referred to as the ABC islands (Leeward Antilles). Collectively, Aruba and the other Dutch islands in the Caribbean are often called the Dutch Caribbean. Aruba has no administrative subdivisions. For census purposes, it is divided into eight regions. Its capital is Oranjestad, Aruba. == People == Aruba's population is about 75% mixed, 15% black, and 10% other ethnicities. The first inhabitants of Aruba were the Caquetío Indians of the Arawak people tribe from Venezuela, with their ancestry still present in Aruba's population today. https://www.aruba.com/us/our-island/history-and-culture/history ==References== Category:Aruba Category:Dependent territories
