Subject: Names of God in Judaism
In Judaism, God is known by many names. The most important of these names is the ''Tetragrammaton'', or "Four-lettered word": YHVH, YHWH, or י ה ו ה. Judaism are not allowed to say this name, and instead say ''Adonai''. Even ''Adonai'' is only used by some Jews in prayer. Most Jews would refer to God as ''Ha-Shem'', or "The Name". Jews are not allowed to erase the Tetragrammaton, so they rarely write it down outside of their most holy books, such as the Torah. Other names include ''Ha-Elohim'', ''Ha-El'', ''Shaddai'', ''Tzeva-ot'', ''‘Ha-Elyon'', and ''Ehyeh-Asher-Ehyeh'' which are respectively pronounced by observant Jews as Elokim, Kayl, Shakkai, Tzeva-Kot. Certain names, such as Shalom, are pronounced as written, but when written one letter, in this case the last letter, is omitted. The last of the above "other" list is often said as Ek-yeh Asher Ek-yeh. == Other Jewish names of (or references) to God include == * Jehovah—["Self-existent"]. Modern-day Hasidic Jews colloquially often substitute with ''Hashem'' (transl. “Name”). * El (Eloah, Elohim)—["God"] * Sabaoth—["Celestial Hosts"] * Adonai—["Lord"] * El Shaddai—["God Almighty"] * Emmanuel—["God with us"]. A symbolic name of the Messiah from the Book of Isaiah. * In the Jewish Kabbalah: Eyn Sof—["Endless"] Category:Judaism
