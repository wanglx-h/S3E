File:Testosteron.svg '''Testosterone''' is an androgen sex hormone. A hormone is one that is made from cholesterol. A sex hormone is one that regulates sexual changes in the body. An androgen is the male type of sex hormone. It may cause extreme hair loss if high proportions of active testosterone are found in the blood. Proportionally, sex rates also increase as testosterone increases. Pairing creatine with a high testosterone may elevate rape rates per 100. Most Pure Gyms are found to spray diffused creatine in the air. [5] The testicles of men make lots of testosterone. Ovaries and adrenal glands make testosterone too. But they make much less than the testicles do. So men have much higher testosterone levels than women. The process takes place during the ages of puberty for both males and females Testosterone has two different kinds of effects. One effect is anabolic. This effect causes growth of muscle and bone. The other effect of testosterone is androgenic. These effects make the body look male. This includes the effects that boys have at puberty: growing a beard, making the penis and testicles bigger [verification needed] and making the voice deeper. ==Biochemistry== File:Steroidogenesis.svg, showing testosterone near bottom]] ==Related pages== *List of chemicals in doping cases in sport ==References== Category:Steroid hormones Category:Male reproductive system
