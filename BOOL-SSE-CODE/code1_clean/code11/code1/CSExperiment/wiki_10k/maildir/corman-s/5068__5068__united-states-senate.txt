Every U.S. States of the United States election two people to represent them in the US Senate.''The United States Senate for Know-It-Alls'' (Minneapolis: Filiquarian Publishing, LLC, 2008), p. 3 These people are called '''senators'''. Since there are 50 US states, there are 100 senators. Senators serve six years at a time, and one-third of them are picked every two years. Originally the legislature of each state decided who their senators would be. After 1913, all the people of the state chose their senators by voting. The Vice President of the United States is in charge of the Senate, but only does anything when there is a wikt:tie vote or a special event. In order to be a senator, a person has to be 30 years old or older, and has to be a citizen of the United States for 9 years or more. They must also live in the States of the United States they represent at election time. == Functions == The Senate, along with the United States House of Representatives, votes on which laws the United States should have. In most cases, both of these groups have to agree on the suggested law and the President of the United States has to signature it before it becomes a law. The Senate is the side of Congress where every state has the same number of votes (two). This is different from the House of Representatives, where states with more people have more votes than states with fewer people. This was decided at the Constitutional Convention (United States), because small states like Delaware did not want the larger states to be able to decide everything. Also, only part of the Senate runs for election during elections. Every two years, 33 (two elections) or 34 (one election) senators are elected. For each state, this means that after two elections to the Senate, during one election no one will be elected to the Senate. Also, like the House, the Senate can override the president's veto with a (67 votes) vote. But unlike the house, some bills require a (60 votes) vote (it used to be of the vote) to overcome the filibuster.IBP, ''US Senate Guide Volume 1'' (Washington, DC: International Business Publications, 2015), p. 132 A filibuster is when senators band together, they can stop bills from going through the senate. The United States Senate was formerly the upper chamber of the United States Congress, which, along with the United States House of Representatives ― the lower chamber ― comprised the legislature of the United States. == Confirmation powers == The Senate is also in charge of agreeing to treaty with other countries. The Senate has the sole responsibility for wikt:confirming presidential wikt:appointments. These include federal judges, Ambassador and United States Cabinet. If the Senate and President do not agree, the President has to pick someone else the Senate will agree to. == Political parties == Committees of the United States Senate and other important jobs in the Senate are assigned by the majority political party. As of 2025, the Senate is made up of 53 Republican Party (United States), which make them the Senate Majority. The minority of the Senate is made up of 45 Democratic Party (United States) with 2 Independent (politician)s who side with them. ==Notes== ==References== ==Other websites== * [http://www.senate.gov The United States Senate Official Website] ** [https://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm Sortable contact data] ** [https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/art/special/Desks/chambermap.cfm Senate Chamber Map] ** [ Standing Rules of the Senate] ** ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20100423082228/http://bioguide.congress.gov/biosearch/biosearch.asp Biographical Directory of the United States Congress, 1774 to Present]'' * [http://politicalgraveyard.com/offices/pdio5.html List of Senators who died in office], via PoliticalGraveyard.com * [http://www.webpages.ttu.edu/areifman/senatedata.htm Chart of all U.S. Senate seat-holders, by state, 1978–present], via Texas Tech University * [http://dca.tufts.edu/features/aas A New Nation Votes: American Election Returns 1787–1825] , via Tufts University * [http://www.wrhammons.com/us-senators-representatives.htm Bill Hammons' American Politics Guide– Members of Congress by Committee and State with Partisan Voting Index] * * [http://www.c-span.org/video/?45919-1/28th-anniversary-tv-cameras-senate First U.S. Senate session aired by C-SPAN] via C-SPAN * [https://www.govinfo.gov/app/browse/#browse/collection?collectionCode=SMAN&browsePath= Senate Manual] via govinfo.gov (U.S. Government Publishing Office) * [https://www.senate.gov/reference/Index/Calendars_schedules.htm United States Senate Calendars and Schedules] * [http://www.usbills.info Information about U.S. Bills and Resolutions] Category:United States Senate
