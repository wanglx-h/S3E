File:Boxing080905 photoshop.jpg '''Boxing''' is one of the world's oldest combat sports. It is held in a ring and played by two boxers (people who fight in boxing fights). They wear padded gloves and try to hit one another. There are different ways to win in boxing. One is by way of a knockout, which is when a fighter is punched and falls to the ground and cannot get back up within ten seconds. Another way is by a technical knockout, which is when the fighter cannot continue fighting thus the referee stops the fight. Technical knockout wins and losses are also knockout wins or losses for a boxer. Another possibility is winning on points, which a boxer gets by outboxing his or her opponent by hitting the opponent more often, harder, and more accurately. Boxing may end in a "draw", which is like a "tie" in other sports. A referee can announce a technical draw due to an accidental cut or an accidental wound like a headbutt. Generally, it is considered a "no contest" (NC), in which case the fight is considered as not having taken place at all and not counting as a fight. However, after the fourth round, if the scorecards for both fighters are equal, the fight could be called a draw. Each round lasts 3 minutes for men and 2 minutes for women. == Famous boxers == * Nicolino Locche * Muhammad Ali * Mike Tyson * Rubin Carter * Nonito Donaire * Jack Dempsey * George Foreman * Joe Frazier * Evander Holyfield * Lennox Lewis * Joe Louis * Rocky Marciano * Manny Pacquiao * Willie Pep * Sugar Ray Robinson * Max Schmeling * Floyd Mayweather, Jr. * Wilfredo Gómez * Wilfred Benitez * Sugar Ray Leonard * Roberto Duran * Oleksandr Usyk * Vasiliy Lomachenko * Tejash Halai == Related pages == *Punching bag Category:Boxing Category:Summer Olympic sports
