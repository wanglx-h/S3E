It was founded in Boise, Idaho in 1925 and it is currently the second largest airline in the United States to date. It is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. On May 3, 2010, it was announced that Continental Airlines would merge with United to become one company. The new airlines will take the United name but use Continental's globe identity and livery. There was a lot of negative reaction to the new livery. Most people were in favor of the iconic "Tulip" logo, designed by Saul Bass in 1973. United is a founding member of Star Alliance alongside Air Canada, Lufthansa, Scandinavian Airlines and Thai Airways International since 1997. ==Accidents and incidents== The following is a handful of memorable incidents involving United Airlines flights; *1960 New York mid-air collision on December 16, 1960. *United Airlines Flight 553 on December 8, 1972. *United Airlines Flight 811 on February 24, 1989. *United Airlines Flight 232 *September 11 attacks **United Airlines Flight 175 at 9:03a.m. **United Airlines Flight 93 at 10:03a.m. *United Airlines Flight 328 on February 20, 2021. ==Gallery== File:United Airlines International Economy Meal.JPG|Airline food on United Airlines File:LockheedL1011UnitedAL (4399853410).jpg|A United Lockheed L-1011 Tristar with the "rainbow" livery used from 1974 to 1993.
