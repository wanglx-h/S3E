Formed in 1994 in Los Angeles, California with four members of Armenians descent, Serj Tankian (lead vocalist, born August 21, 1967), Daron Malakian (lead guitar, singer, born July 18, 1975), Shavo Odadjian (bass guitar, background singer, born April 22, 1974) and drummer Andy Khachaturian (but was replaced with John Dolmayan). The band became successful with popular songs like "Sugar", "Spiders", "Chop Suey!", "Toxicity (song)", "Aerials (song)", "B.Y.O.B.", "Question!", "Hypnotize (song)", and "Lonely Day". After the release of ''Mezmerize''/''Hypnotize'', System of a Down went on a break, but they say they have not broken up. Often described as very angry, Khachaturian was unhappy about his place as drummer, and wanted to lead the band. He left the band and the drummer from the band, "Friik", John Dolmayan, joined the band. ==Early days== Serj, Daron, and Shavo, went to the same school, Alex Pilibos School for Armenian Americans in Los Angeles, when they were young. However, they never actually met until they started working in the LA music scene as young adults because of the age difference. In 1995, they made their first demo tape, and had the songs: "Suite-Pee", "Sugar", "Dam", and "P.L.U.C.K.(Politically Lying Unholy Cowardly Killers)". In 1996, another demo tape was released with the songs: Soil, and two songs that were not on the first album, "Honey" and "Temper". They made another demo tape, and this was the one that got them put on the record label. The producer, Rick Rubin, had tried to sign up the band several times before they agreed. ==First album== In 1997, SOAD teamed up with Rubin and produced their first Album. In June 30, 1998, ''System of a Down'' was released. This album was not as popular as the next album, but it made people aware of who and what System of a Down stood for. Their next album, ''Toxicity (album)'', was released on September 4, 2001, had their first UK top 20 single "Chop Suey". This album explores a more melody side of metal music. It is also wikt:political; for example the opening track: "Prison Song" which has Serj speaking the lines. ==Double album== In May 17, 2005, the band released part one of a double album, ''Mezmerize''. It was more melodic than before, and included "B.Y.O.B" (Bring Your Own Bombs), and "Lost in Hollywood" - a song based on Daron's childhood about growing up in Hollywood, which he did not think was very glamorous. Six months later, the second part of the double album, ''Hypnotize (album)'', was released November 22, 2005. This was the same sort of style because they were recorded at the same time. ==Taking a break== In 2006, the band decided that they were going to have a break for a little while. They said they were going to come back together in a few years. After 10 years together, they each wanted to do different things for a while. There were rumors of them returning in 2011. In July 2010, Dolmayan said in an interview that the band would probably tour in 2011. ==Band members== ;Current lineup * Serj Tankian – vocals, keyboards, rhythm guitar (1994–2006, 2010–present) * Daron Malakian – lead guitar, vocals (1994–2006, 2010–present) * Shavo Odadjian – bass, backing vocals (1994–2006, 2010–present) * John Dolmayan – drums, percussion (1997–2006, 2010–present) ;Former * Andy Khachaturian – drums (1994–1997) ===Timeline=== TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy Legend = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:3 ScaleMajor = increment:2 start:1994 ScaleMinor = increment:1 start:1994 Colors = id:Lvocals value:red legend:Vocals id:Bvocals value:pink legend:Backing_vocals id:Lguitar value:teal legend:Lead_guitar id:Rguitar value:brightgreen legend:Rhythm_guitar id:Keyboards value:purple legend:Keyboards id:Bass value:blue legend:Bass id:Drums value:orange legend:Drums,_percussion id:Studio value:black legend:Studio_album id:Demos value:gray(0.5) legend:Demo id:bars value:gray(0.95) BackgroundColors = bars:bars LineData = layer:back color:Studio at:06/30/1998 at:09/04/2001 at:11/26/2002 at:05/17/2005 at:11/22/2005 color:Demos at:01/01/1995 at:01/01/1996 at:01/01/1997 BarData = bar:Serj text:"Serj Tankian" bar:Daron text:"Daron Malakian" bar:Shavo text:"Shavo Odadjian" bar:Andy text:"Andy Khachaturian" bar:John text:"John Dolmayan" PlotData= width:11 bar:Serj from:01/01/1994 till:07/13/2006 color:Lvocals bar:Serj from:01/01/1994 till:07/13/2006 color:Keyboards width:3 bar:Serj from:01/01/2001 till:07/13/2006 color:Rguitar width:7 bar:Serj from:11/29/2010 till:end color:Lvocals bar:Serj from:11/29/2010 till:end color:Keyboards width:3 bar:Serj from:11/29/2010 till:end color:Rguitar width:7 bar:Daron from:01/01/1994 till:07/13/2006 color:Lguitar bar:Daron from:01/01/1994 till:01/01/2001 color:Rguitar width:7 bar:Daron from:01/01/1994 till:06/01/2004 color:Bvocals width:3 bar:Daron from:06/01/2004 till:07/13/2006 color:Lvocals width:3 bar:Daron from:11/29/2010 till:end color:Lguitar bar:Daron from:11/29/2010 till:end color:Lvocals width:3 bar:Shavo from:01/01/1994 till:07/13/2006 color:Bass bar:Shavo from:01/01/1994 till:07/13/2006 color:Bvocals width:3 bar:Shavo from:11/29/2010 till:end color:Bass bar:Shavo from:11/29/2010 till:end color:Bvocals width:3 bar:John from:06/01/1997 till:07/13/2006 color:Drums bar:John from:11/29/2010 till:end color:Drums bar:Andy from:01/01/1994 till:06/01/1997 color:Drums }} ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== {| class="wikitable" !
