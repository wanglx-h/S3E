Subject: Apostrophe
The '''apostrophe''' ('''Ↄ''', '''ↄ''', '''’'''), also known as the '''apostrophus''', is a punctuation mark used in writing. It is also a diacritic. In English, it has two jobs:Quirk, Geenbaum, Leech & Svartvik, ''A comprehensive grammar of the English language''. Longman, London & New York. p985 * To show where one or more letters have been left out, as in the abbreviation (contraction) of ''do not'' to ''don't''. * To show the possessive case, as in ''the cat’s whiskers''. == Examples == === Its versus it's === The most common grammatical mistake in written English is to put ''it's'' where ''its'' is correct. '''''Its''''': a possessive adjective and pronoun of the personal pronoun ''it''. *''The cat chased its tail''. (correct) *''The tyre lost it's grip''. (wrong) '''''It's''''': a contraction of the verbal phrase ''it is'' or ''it has''. *''It's mine''. (correct; check: ''It is mine'') *''It's been here''. (correct; check: ''It has been here'') *''The cat chased it's tail''. (wrong; cannot be expanded to ''it is'') The same applies to ''yours'', ''theirs'' and ''ours'' because these are also possessive adjectives of personal pronouns. *''The colour is ours''. *''That book is hers'' (or ''his''). *''Theirs was the responsibility''. === Possession === Apostrophes are also used to show something belongs to someone (or something). Again, correct uses can be expanded: * ''Mike's car''. (correct; the car that belongs to Mike) * ''The dog's ball''. (correct; the ball that belongs to the dog) *''Those dog's are large''. (wrong; here "dogs" is a plural word) === The intrusive apostrophe === Comes in plurals which don't (''do not'') need it. Do not put an apostrophe in word ending in '''s''', such as a plural. Put an apostrophe, or 's, at the end of the word instead. *''Mr. Jones' hat'' or ''Mr. Jones's hat''. (both correct) *''Both of my parents' birthdays''. (correct) *''CD's'' and ''DVD's'' (wrong; not possessive. See "Plural" section below) *''Apple's'' and ''pear's'' (wrong; not possessive) === Writing dialogue or titles === Apostrophes are also used when other words are shortened, as in slang: *''Go get 'em tiger!'' or ''Li'l Bow Bow''. This is just a version of the abbreviation function. === Plural === To make a word that doesn't (''does not'') usually exist as a plural into a plural, an apostrophe is occasionally used. See these examples: * ''How many A's did you get this year?'' Here it is wrong because it is not needed. * ''The poll received many yes's and very few no's.'' Here it is sensible because without it the words 'yess' and 'nos' look quite peculiar. However, you may find 'yeses' and 'noes' are appropriate as plurals. General rule: if an apostrophe is not needed, do not use it. == References == Category:Punctuation Category:Grammar
