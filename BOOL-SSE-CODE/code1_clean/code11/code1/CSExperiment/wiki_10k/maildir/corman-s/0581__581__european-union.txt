It was created by the Treaty of Maastricht in 1993. It is a unique Politics Organization; in some ways, it acts like a federation, and in other ways, it acts like a confederation. (Political scientists call the EU a "sui generis" organisation, which means the EU is so unique that it is hard to compare it to anything else.) The EU grew out of the '''European Economic Community''' ('''EEC'''), which was formed by the Treaty of Rome in 1957. It has created a common economic area with Europe-wide Law, allowing the Citizenship of EU countries to move and trade in other EU countries almost the same as they do in their own. Nineteen of these countries also share the same type of money: the euro. The Treaty of Lisbon is the most recent treaty that explains how the Union is run. Every member state signed it, to show that they each agreed with what it says. Most importantly, it says which jobs (’Power’) the Union should do for the members and which jobs they should do themselves. The members decide how the Union should act by voting for or against proposals. The objective of the EU is to bring its member states closer together, while also respecting human rights and democracy. It does this by helping its members to decide on common rules for many things, like law enforcement, passport, and how to trade fairly with each other. Most members share a common currency (the euro) and most allow people to travel from one country to another without having to show a passport. == History == File:Quai d'Orsay.jpg After World War II, most country in Europe wanted to live peacefully together and help one another's economy. Instead of fighting each other for coal and steel, the first member countries-- Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg-- created the European Coal and Steel Community in 1952. Its job was to make rules for how to trade coal and steel in a fair way, and to make sure its members were following the rules. In 1957, in the Italian city of Rome, the member countries signed another treaty that made the '''European Economic Community (ECC)'''. Now it was a community for trade all sorts of things, not just coal and steel. In 1993, with the ''Treaty of Maastricht'', the ECC joined together with a few other international organizations in Europe to form the '''European Union.''' Now it would help its member countries work together in many different ways; not only with trade, but also with money, justice (laws), and Foreign policy. In 1995, the EU created the Schengen Area, and 22 member countries of the EU opened their Border to each other. This means that people can now travel from one country to the other without a passport or identity card. In 1999, the EU created its own currency, which is called the euro. Many of its member states got rid of their old currencies, and now use the euro. However, a few countries, like Denmark and Poland, chose to keep their own currency. European Union|url=https://european-union.europa.eu/institutions-law-budget/euro/countries-using-euro_en|access-date=2025-03-15|website=european-union.europa.eu|language=en}} Over time, more countries have joined the EU. In 2004, ten new countries became part of the EU: Cyprus, Czechia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia. In 2007, two more countries, Bulgaria and Romania, joined the EU. Most recently, Croatia joined the EU in 2013. Then, in 2020, the Brexit. As of 2025, there are 27 member countries. European Union|url=https://european-union.europa.eu/principles-countries-history/facts-and-figures-european-union_en|access-date=2025-03-15|website=european-union.europa.eu|language=en}} The EU is now the world's largest single market, with a population of about 450 million people. If the EU were a single country, it would be the world's third largest country. In Tariffs in the second Trump administration.

Retrieved 2025-04-09 The situation is sometimes called a trade war. == Free movement == A person who is a citizen of the European Union can live and work in any of the 27 member states without needing a work permit or visa. For example, a French people person can move to Greece to work there, or just to live there, and he or she does not need permission from an authority in Greece. Product (business) made in one member country can be sold in any other member country without any special permissions or extra Tax. For this reason, the members agree to rules about product safety - they want to know that a product made in another country will be as safe as it would be if it had been made in their own. == Main institutions == '''Institutions of the European Union''':wikisource:Consolidated version of the Treaty on European Union/Title III: Provisions on the Institutions {| cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" style="background:#E0E0E0; width:100%" |- style="text-align:center" | style="width:25%; padding-left:15px; padding-top:10px;"| File:Europarl logo.svg'''European Parliament''' - Legislative (lower house) - | rowspan="9" style="background:white" | | style="width:25%; padding-left:15px; padding-top:10px;"| File:European Council logo.svg'''European Council''' - Sets impetus and direction - | rowspan="9" style="background:white" | | style="width:25%; padding-left:15px; padding-top:10px;"| File:Former logo of the European Council and Council of the European Union (2009).svg'''Council of the European Union''' - Legislative (upper house) - | rowspan="9" style="background:white" | | style="width:25%; padding-left:15px; padding-top:10px;"| File:Logo ce-fr-quadri.svg'''European Commission''' - Executive (government) - |- style="text-align: center" | File:Hemicycle of Louise Weiss building of the European Parliament, Strasbourg.jpg | File:Familiefoto europese raad 2011.jpg | File:EU Council Room.jpg | File:Banderas europeas en la Comisión Europea.jpg |- | style="vertical-align:top; padding-left:15px; padding-bottom:10px;"| * Acts together with the council as a legislator * Election by the people every five years * Works with the Council to decide what the European Union budget should be; the Parliament gets the final say * Exerts the democratic control over EU institutions including the European Commission and appoints the Commission members * based and plenary sessions in Strasbourg, General Secretariat in Luxembourg (city), primarily meets in Brussels | style="vertical-align:top; padding-left:15px; padding-bottom:10px;"| * summit of the Head of Government, chaired by the President of the European Council) * gives the necessary impetus for the development and sets out general objectives and priorities * will not legislate * based in Brussels, Belgium | style="vertical-align:top; padding-left:15px; padding-bottom:10px;"| * Consists of government ministers from member states * Acts together with the Parliament as a legislator * Exerts together with the Parliament the budgetary power * Ensures coordination of the broad economic and social policy and sets out guidelines for the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) * Conclude international agreements * Based in Brussels, Belgium | style="vertical-align:top; padding-left:15px; padding-bottom:10px;"| * Is the "government" * Has one member from each member state * Submits proposals for new legislation to the Parliament and to the Council * Implements EU policy and administers the European Union budget * Ensures compliance with EU law * Negotiates international treaties * Based in Brussels, Belgium |- | colspan="9" style="background:white" | |} {| cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" style="background:#E0E0E0; width:100%" |- style="text-align:center" | rowspan="7" style="width:11%; background:white;"| File:No image wide.svg | style="width:26%; padding-left:15px; padding-top:10px;"| '''Court of Justice of the European Union''' - Judiciary - | rowspan="7" style="background:white" | | style="width:26%; padding-left:15px; padding-top:10px;"| File:CURIA RATIONUM logo.svg'''European Court of Auditors''' - Financial auditor - | rowspan="7" style="background:white" | | style="width:26%; padding-left:15px; padding-top:10px;"| File:Logo European Central Bank.svg'''European Central Bank''' - Monetary executive (central bank) - | rowspan="7" style="width:11%; background:white;"| File:No image wide.svg |- style="text-align: center" | File:Sitzungssaal EuGH.jpg | File:Europäischer Rechnungshof.jpg | File:European Central Bank 041107.jpg |- | style="vertical-align:top; padding-left:15px; padding-bottom:10px;"| * Ensure uniformity of interpretation of European law * Has the power to decide legal disputes between European Union member state, EU institutions, businesses and individuals * Based in Luxembourg (city) | style="vertical-align:top; padding-left:15px; padding-bottom:10px;"| * Shall examine the proper use of revenue and expenditure of the EU institutions * Based in Luxembourg (city) | style="vertical-align:top; padding-left:15px; padding-bottom:10px;"| * Forms together with the national central banks the European System of Central Banks and thereby determining the monetary policy of the EU * Ensures price stability of the Euro by controlling the money supply of participating countries * Based in Frankfurt am Main, Germany |} === Council of the European Union === File:Organs of the European Union.svg The Council of the European Union is the main decision-making group. The Cabinet minister of the member countries meet (Ministers for Foreign affairs, for Agriculture, for Justice, etc...) and discuss issues that are important to them. Before the Treaty of Lisbon (written in 2007, implemented in 2008) each member state took a turn at being President of the council for six months. For example, from January 2007 until July 2007, Germany held the presidency. The six months before that, Finland held the presidency. Now the President of the European Union chairs the council summits. The President of the council is the organiser and manager and is voted into office for a duration of two and a half years. He or she does not have the power to make decisions about the European Union like the President of the United States does for that country. Member countries with a large population (Germany, France, United Kingdom, etc.) have more votes than countries with small populations (Luxembourg, Malta, etc.) but a decision cannot be made if enough countries vote against the decision. Twice a year, the heads of government (Prime Ministers) and/or the heads of state (Presidents) meet to talk about the main issues and make decisions on different issues. This meeting is different and not as formal. It is known as a European Council. :''Note: This is not the same thing as the ''Council of Europe'', which is not part of the European Union''. === European Commission === The European Commission runs the day-to-day running of the EU and writes laws, like a government. Laws written by the commission are discussed and changed by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. The commission has one President and 27 Commissioners, selected by the European Council. The Commission President is appointed by the European Council with the approval of the European Parliament. The commission operates like a cabinet government. There is one Commissioner per European Union member state, though Commissioners are bound to represent the interests of the EU as a whole rather than their home state. === European Parliament === File:EP Strasbourg hemicycle l-gal.jpg The Parliament has a total of 720 members (called Member of the European Parliament, or MEP). They are elected in their countries every five years by the citizens of the European Union member countries. The Parliament can approve, reject or change proposed laws. It can also sack the European Commission. In that case, the entire commission would have to give up their jobs. == Politics == There are many discussions in the EU about how it should develop and change in the future. The main reasons why European countries came together are political and economic: * The need to prevent another European war after World War I and World War II. * The need to respect human rights, rule of law and democracy more affirmed by Council of Europe. * The need to have a common economic area. == Member states == In 1951, six countries made the ''European Coal and Steel Community'', a basic version of what the EU is now. These six then went further and in 1957 they made the European Economic Community and the European Coal and Steel Community. The UK and others decided not to join, and then when the UK changed its mind it was stopped from joining by President of the French Republic Charles de Gaulle. When he was no longer President, the UK and others started to join. Today there are 27 members but the idea that more should join is not seen as a good one by everyone.

Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo are expected to follow. However, since there have been many political problems happening in Turkey recently, especially with Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's arresting of tens of thousands of political rivals since the failed Coup d'état attempt on July 15, 2016, it is unlikely that it would be allowed to part of the EU anytime soon because EU members believe that the current Turkish government is not respecting human rights, rule of law, or democracy. ==Motto== '''''United in diversity''''' (or ''together with many types of people'' in Simple English), is the motto of the European Union. The motto in other languages: {| |- |valign=top| * * * * * * * * |valign=top| * * * * * * * * |valign=top| * * * * * * * |} == Brexit == On June 23, 2016, the UK held a referendum on whether it should stay in the EU or leave it. The majority [52% to 48%] favored leaving. Britain leaving the EU is commonly known as United Kingdom European Union membership referendum. The government of the UK wikt:invoked "Article 50" of the Treaty of European Union (the Treaty of Lisbon) on 29 March 2017. This began negotiations with fellow members of the EU on the terms of exit. The timetable for these negotiations was two years, which meant that the UK would remain a member of the EU until at least March 2019. This deadline was later extended to October 31st 2019 at the request of the British Government. The United Kingdom left the European Union on the 31 of January 2020 at 23:00 (Greenwich Mean Time). Following Brexit, the '''transition period''' expired on December 31, 2020 and ended on January 1, 2021. ==Related pages== * Citizenship of the European Union * European Union law * Multilingualism * United Kingdom European Union membership referendum * Robert Schuman ==References== == References == == Other websites == * [http://europa.eu/ European Union online portal] * [http://www.eu2013.lt/en/ Lithuania's EU Council Presidency] * [http://ec.europa.eu/youreurope/ 'Your Europe' information website] * [http://www.ina.fr/europe-des-cultures/En/Html/PrincipaleAccueil.php Europe of cultures] 50 years of artistic creation and cultural life from the 27 countries of the European Union Category:European Union Category:1952 establishments in Europe Category:G7 nations Category:G8 nations
