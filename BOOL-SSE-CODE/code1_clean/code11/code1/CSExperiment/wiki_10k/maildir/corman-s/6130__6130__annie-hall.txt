Plot, Cast, Awards, & Facts|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Annie-Hall|access-date=2021-06-28|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}} ==Plot== The movie takes place in New York City and the latter half in Los Angeles, California. It tells the story of Alvy Singer, a comedian from Brooklyn, who is obsessed with death. He has an affair with the title character, Annie Hall (played by Diane Keaton) and the two embark on a romance. He encourages Annie to further her career as a nightclub singer. Alvy recalls how his Brooklyn house was below a roller coaster on Coney Island. His father was the owner of a place that had bumper cars, something that reflected the marriage between Alvy's father and Alvy's mother. Throughout the film, many flashbacks are included, often humourously; however, when Alvy recalls his times with Annie, the comedic mood turns nostalgic and Alvy is left wondering what could have happened differently if his insecurities were not in the way. Alvy asks Annie to marry him after they split. She tells him no, as she wants to stay friends. ==Techniques== ''Annie Hall'' is noted for its use of special elements such as double exposure (two pictures in one) and magic themes in a real setting.
