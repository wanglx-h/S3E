In late 2005, the San Jose Earthquakes moved to the city because of financial problems in San Jose, California. The Dynamo opened a new stadium, which opened as BBVA Compass Stadium and is now known as Shell Energy Stadium, in downtown Houston in May 2012, after playing their first seven games of the season on the road. ==League title== *Major League Soccer : 2 **Major League Soccer 2006, Major League Soccer 2007 ==League position== {| class="wikitable" style="text-align:left;" |align="center"|Season||align="center"|League||align="center"|Position |- |Major League Soccer 2006||Major League Soccer||Champions |- |Major League Soccer 2007||Major League Soccer||Champions |- |Major League Soccer 2008||Major League Soccer||Quarterfinals |} ==References== Category:American soccer teams Category:Sports in Houston Category:Major League Soccer teams Category:2005 establishments in the United States Category:2000s establishments in Texas
