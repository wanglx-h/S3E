A '''community''' is a collection of living creatures that share a common habitat. They are frequently interested in the same things. People in human groups share some of the same value (personal and cultural) and needs, which has an impact on the group's and individuals' cultural identity. Despite the fact that communities are established on personal interests, each individual is unique in their own manner, which is the primary source of social variety in a community. == Related pages == *International community *Virtual community Category:Community
