Member countries of OECD all have a democracy of government. They also accept the principle of a free economy. A country has a free economy when its government does not control the economic activities of its citizens and companies. The OECD started 1948 as the '''Organisation for European Economic Co-operation''' (OEEC). WWII had just ended three years before in 1945. Some countries of Europe came together to form OEEC to help each other re-build their industry and other things destroyed in the Second World War. Later on, some non-European countries also joined this organisation. In 1960, OEEC changed its name, and it became OECD: the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The OECD's headquarters are at the Château de la Muette in Paris. ==Secretaries General== {|class="wikitable" style="clear:right; text-align:center" |+ Secretary-General of the OECD ! No. !
