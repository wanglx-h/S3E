The Canadiens have won 25 league titles in the National Hockey League, winning 23 Stanley Cups. As NHL champion, Montreal failed to win the Stanley Cup in 1919 Stanley Cup Finals, when the Spanish flu cancelled the Stanley Cup finals against the Seattle Metropolitans of Pacific Coast Hockey Association, and in 1925 Stanley Cup Finals, when they lost in the Stanley Cup to the Western Canada Hockey League's Victoria Cougars. | conf_titles = '''8''' (1975–76 NHL season, 1976–77 NHL season, 1977–78 NHL season, 1978–79 NHL season, 1980–81 NHL season, 1985–86 NHL season, 1988–89 NHL season, 1992–93 NHL season)Though the Canadiens won the Clarence S. Campbell Bowl and advanced into the Stanley Cup Finals in 2021 Stanley Cup Finals, this does not count as a conference championship.

Their nickname is the "Habs" (short for the French "Habitants", early settlers in Quebec from France). They have won the Stanley Cup championship 24 times, more than any other team. == History == The Canadiens (who use the French spelling of "Canadian") were formed in 1909, as part of the National Hockey Association. === Early games === They won their first Stanley Cup in 1916, with star players such as Edouard "Newsy" Lalonde and goaltender Georges Vezina. The Canadiens joined the NHL in 1917; Canadien Joe Malone won the first NHL scoring title (Art Ross Trophy). They won the Cup again in 1924, with players such as Billy Boucher. Howie Morenz was a big star in the early years of the NHL. He was a great skater. Morenz won the Hart Trophy, as the league's top player, three times. Goalie George Hainsworth played at the same time, and along with others such as Aurel Joliat, they won the Stanley Cup in 1930 and 1931. It took 13 years before they won the Cup again. A young Maurice Richard, star goalie Bill Durnan,Hector "Toe" Blake, and Elmer Lach led the Canadiens to the cup again in 1944, as well as 1946. Richard scored 50 goals in a 50-game season in 1944-45. No one did that again for 36 years. He led the NHL in goals five times. === Later games === Image:Canadianswin.jpg The Canadiens became a very powerful team in the 1950s. Led by legendary center Jean Beliveau, Doug Harvey (who won seven Norris Trophy as best defence, six on Montreal), Bernie "Boom Boom" Geoffrion, Dickie Moore, Jacques Plante (who won seven Vezina Trophy for goalies), and Richard (along with his younger brother, Henri, the "Pocket Rocket"), the team won the Cup in 1953, and five times in a row, 1956 through 1960. They won again in 1965, 1966, 1968, and 1969. === New members === New players led the team in the 1970s: Guy Lafleur, Ken Dryden, Bob Gainey, Larry Robinson, and Yvon Cournoyer led them to the cup in 1971, 1973, and four times in a row, 1976 through 1979. By 1979, they had won the Stanley Cup 16 times in 27 years. ==Personnel== ===Team captains=== * Jack Laviolette, 1909–1910, 1911–1912 * Newsy Lalonde, 1910–1911, 1912–1913, 1916–1922 * Jimmy Gardner (ice hockey), 1913–1915 * Howard McNamara, 1915–1916 * Sprague Cleghorn, 1922–1925 * Billy Coutu, 1925–1926 * Sylvio Mantha, 1926–1932, 1933–1936 * George Hainsworth, 1932–1933 * Babe Siebert, 1936–1939 * Walter Buswell, 1939–1940 * Toe Blake, 1940–1948 * Bill Durnan, 1948 (January–April) * Émile Bouchard, 1948–1956 * Maurice Richard, 1956–1960 * Doug Harvey (ice hockey), 1960–1961 * Jean Béliveau, 1961–1971 * Henri Richard, 1971–1975 * Yvan Cournoyer, 1975–1979 * Serge Savard, 1979–1981 * Bob Gainey, 1981–1989 * Guy Carbonneau and Chris Chelios, 1989–1990 (co-captains) * Guy Carbonneau, 1990–1994 * Kirk Muller, 1994–1995 * Mike Keane, 1995 (April–December) * Pierre Turgeon, 1995–1996 * Vincent Damphousse, 1996–1999 * Saku Koivu, 1999–2009 * Brian Gionta, 2010–2014 * Max Pacioretty, 2015–2018 * Shea Weber, 2018–2022 * Nick Suzuki, 2022–present ==Related pages== *List of Montreal Canadiens players == References == * '''Notes''' ==Other websites== *[http://canadiens.nhl.com Official website] Category:1909 establishments in Canada Category:Montreal Canadiens Category:National Hockey League teams
