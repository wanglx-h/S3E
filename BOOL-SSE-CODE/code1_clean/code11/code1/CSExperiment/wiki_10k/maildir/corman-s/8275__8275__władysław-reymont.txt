File:Władysław Reymont.jpg '''Władysław Stanisław Reymont''', born as '''Stanisław Władysław Rejment''', (May 7, 1867 in Kobielce Wielkie, Poland – December 5, 1925 in Warsaw, Poland) was a well-known Poland writer, who won the Nobel Prize in 1924 for his four-volume epic novel "Chłopi" (''The Peasants''). This novel was about life of this part of the society. He also wrote "Ziemia obiecana" (''The Promised Land''), about industrial capitalism in 19th century Łódź. Many people say he is one of the greatest and most prominent Polish writers of all time and one of the greatest in 20th century. ==Biography== Reymont was born in the family of the organist. His father, Józef Rejment, a well-read man, had a musical education and in tuszyńskiej performed the parish duties of the organist, and also carried on Civil Status Registers and the correspondence of the parish priest with Russian authorities. Mother, Antonia from Kupczyńskich, had talent for a story. She came from the impoverished Cracow gentry; in mature years the writer has often emphasized this fact.
