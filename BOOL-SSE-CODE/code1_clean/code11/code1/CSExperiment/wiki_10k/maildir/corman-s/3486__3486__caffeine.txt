It is found in parts of Plant, for example tea leaves and coffee beans. Its artificial form is also used in some Soft drink and Energy drink. It is the world's most popular psychoactive drug, and is legal in all of the world, and is most often taken in a caffeinated drink. == Sources == Caffeine is naturally found in the fruits, leaves and beans of coffee, Cacao tree, guarana and tea plants. The plants use caffeine as a ''pesticide''. This is a chemical that kills Insect if they eat the plant. It is the way the plant protects itself. Caffeine was first extracted from cocoa beans into its purest form which is a white powder and the word originated from the German word “Kaffee” and the French word “café” which both mean caffeine. When it comes from the guarana plant it is called '''guaranine,''' when it comes from a tea plant, it is called '''theine,''' and in the Mate (drink) it is called '''mateine''' (this drink is an infusion made with Yerba mate). == What caffeine is == File:Koffein - Caffeine.svg ]] Caffeine is a ''stimulant'' drug. A stimulant is a drug that increases body actions like heart rate, blood pressure, and metabolism. It makes a person more awake and alert. Caffeine also is a diuretic. This means it makes a person make more urine (the waste liquid a person makes). The caffeine chemical is called a ''xanthine alkaloid''. This is a group of chemicals that are stimulants. Some xanthine alkaloids (like theophylline) are used to help asthma. == What caffeine is used for == The biggest use of caffeine is as a stimulant. People drink coffee and other drinks with caffeine to stay awake. In the beginning caffeine was found to relieve hunger, so it was used for weight loss. That did not last because people were using too much. Caffeine can be dangerous when not used in the right way. Medical doctor sometimes use caffeine as a medicine. It is added to analgesics (drugs used for pain). This can improve their effect on headaches and other pain. It is sometimes used to help Premature birth babies (babies born very early) to breathe. The short-term risk of this treatment seems to be that the babies treated gain less weight than usual. Caffeine is sometimes given to people after a lumbar puncture. This is when a needle is pushed between the bones of the lower back, normally to check for illnesses like meningitis. == Problems with caffeine == File:Caffeinated spiderwebs.jpgs. The image above shows a spiderweb which was woven by a normal spider. The image below shows a web of a spider that had received Caffeine in an Animal testing]] The largest problem with caffeine is addiction. This is when people get bad symptoms when they do not have the drug. When people have ''Drug withdrawal'' (feel bad because they do not have the drug) they drink more. This makes them feel better. But if they cannot get more, they are likely to feel some of the symptoms listed below: * Headaches * Being tired or need to sleep * Caffeine can prevent sleep and in the long-term alters brain functions ** Sleep deprivation leads to a weakened connectivity between the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex which regulate mood and emotion. *** This causes the consumer to feel irritable, tired, restlessness, and anxious. * Nausea (feeling like vomiting) Caffeine can also hurt people if they drink a lot at once. If a person consumed 10-13 grams of caffeine quickly, between 80 and 100 cups of coffee, they would overdose and may even die. Caffeine overdose is a medical diagnosis. It is called: ''Caffeine-Induced Organic Mental Disorder'' or ''Caffeine Intoxication''. People with this can have these symptoms: * Very bad feelings like: ** ''Paranoia'' (feeling as if people are about to hurt the person) ** ''Restlessness'' or ''nervousness'' (with the person feeling like he cannot sit down or rest) ** ''Anxiety'' (very bad worry) * Muscle movements that cannot be stopped * Very fast heart rate * Abnormal heart rhythms (even heart stopping) * Very high blood pressure * Vomiting * Confusion (not knowing who the person is or where he/she is) == Caffeine helps for == Caffeine also has some strong advantages: Coffee Corner|date=2017-10-26|newspaper=Coffee Corner|access-date=2017-12-03|language=en-US}} * Lower risk of Coronary artery disease * Cut stroke risk * Speed up metabolism * Increases memory * Helps ward off Alzheimer's disease * Reduces Kidney stone disease risk == How much caffeine is safe == 250–300mg of caffeine a day is a ''moderate'' amount. That is as much caffeine that is in three cups of coffee (8oz each cup). More than 750–1000mg a day is a significant amount, but is very unlikely to kill someone. The LD50 of caffeine is 192mg per kilogram, in rats. In humans, it is between 150 and 200mg per kilogram (70-90 per pound.) Caffeine is in many drinks and foods. This is ''approximate'' amounts of caffeine in some food and drink: * Brewed coffee – 40 to 220mg in a cup * Instant coffee – 30 to 120mg in a cup * ''Decaffeinated'' coffee (with most caffeine taken out) – 3 to 5mg in a cup * Tea – 20 to 110mg in a cup * Soda drinks with caffeine – 36 to 90mg in 12 ounces. Some people think that soft drinks which are light in color do not contain caffeine. This is not always true. * Milk chocolate – 3 to 6mg in an ounce * Bittersweet chocolate – 25mg in an ounce One ounce – abbreviation oz – is 30ml. A 'cup' is 8 oz (240ml.) == Different ways to get 200mg of caffeine == {| class="toccolours" border="1" style="margin: 0 2em 1em 0; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 90%" !Caffeine equivalents |- |In general, each of the following contains approximately 200kilogram#SI multiples of caffeine: * '''One''' 200milligram caffeine pill * '''One''' 2.5 fluid ounceUpshot energy shot (75Milliliter#SI prefixes applied to the litre). * '''One''' 12 fluid ounce cup of regular Starbucks coffee (355Milliliter#SI prefixes applied to the litre) Pike Place – 235mg Blonde Roast – 270mg * '''One and a half''' Pound (mass) of chocolate[a] (680grams) * '''Two''' 8 fluid ounce containers of regular coffee (470 millilitres) * '''Five''' 1 fluid ounce shots of espresso from Coffee beans (150millilitres) * '''Eight and a half''' 8 fluid ounce cups of Coca-Cola Classic (68 fl oz is approximately 2.0litres) * '''Ten''' 8 fluid ounce cups of green tea[b] (2.4litres) * '''Fifty''' 8 fluid ounce cups of decaffeinated coffee (12litres) Notes: A ''fluid ounce'' is between 28 and 30 millilitres. a. There may also be large amounts of other chemicals, similar to caffeine in chocolate and other products of cacao. There is theobromine in cacao, for example. These substances can have effects similar to those of caffeine. b. Most tea drunk in North America is not very strong. The figures are for this kind of tea. The tea drunk in most other places of the world is stronger; for these kinds of tea, the figures are probably too small. |} == References == == Other websites == === Scientific information === * [http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic3115.htm eMedicine Caffeine-Related Psychiatric Disorders] * [http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/Library/studies/cu/CU21.html The Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs, Caffeine-Part 1] [http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/Library/studies/cu/CU22.html Part 2] * [http://www.physsportsmed.com/issues/1997/11nov/caffeine.htm ''The Physician and Sportsmedicine'': Caffeine: A User's Guide] * [http://www.garynull.com/Documents/CaffeineEffects.htm Caffeine: Psychological Effects, Use & Abuse] * [http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/Press_releases/2004/09_29_04.html Caffeine Withdrawal Recognized as a Disorder] * [http://www.benbest.com/health/caffeine.html Is Caffeine a Health Hazard?] === Others === * [https://ykhoablog.com/tin-tuc/caffeine-co-tac-dong-gi-den-co-the-ban/ Caffeine Withdrawal Symptoms] * [http://home.howstuffworks.com/caffeine.htm Caffeine: How Stuff Works] * [https://brokebutshredded.com/caffeine-the-most-popular-psychoactive-drug/ Caffeine: The most popular psychoactive drug, Broke but Shredded, January 2022] * [http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/caffeine/caffeine.shtml Erowid Caffeine Vaults] * [http://www.caffeinated.jp/ #caffeine! - The Caffeine Information Archive] * [http://www.thenakedscientists.com/html/columnists/dalyacolumn2.htm Naked Scientists Online: Why do plants make caffeine?] * [http://historyofalcoholanddrugs.typepad.com/alcohol_and_drugs_history/caffeine/index.html Alcohol and Drugs History Society: Caffeine news page] * [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6155178 Coffee: A Little Really Does Go a Long Way, NPR, September 28, 2006] * [http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/4664/Does-coffee-really-give-you-a-buzz- Does coffee really give you a buzz? by John Triggs in the Daily Express April 17 2007] * Burgower, Rachael. “The Effects of Energy Drinks on Sleep and Daily Functioning.” , 2014, pp.1–59. === News === * [http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=30d6d514-1c68-441a-bbec-5b80ae23627f&k=45911 National Post: Caffeine linked to psychiatric disorders] Category:Organonitrogen compounds Category:Stimulants Category:Former good articles
