File:Unicorn 3 (PSF).png A '''unicorn''' is a legendary creature. It looks like a pony with one long, single white horn (anatomy) on its head. In some pictures unicorns also have Horse feet or a lion tail. In most myths, a unicorn's blood and horn have mystical powers. The word ''unicorn'' means "one-horned". It comes from the Latin word ''ūnus'', which means ''one'', and ''cornu'' which means ''horn'', which term is in itself borrowed from the earlier Greek language word ''monokerōs'' (also 'one horned'). The term "unicorn" is also used in business to refer to a business startup valued at a 1,000,000,000 United States dollar or more. == Around the world == Unicorns are found in many stories and myths from around the world, especially China and India. In ''On the Nature of Animals'' (''Περὶ Ζῴων Ἰδιότητος'', ''De natura animalium''), Claudius Aelianus, quoting Ctesias, says that India has a one-horned horse (iii. 41; iv. 52). He writes (xvi. 20) that the ''monoceros'' () was sometimes called ''cartazonos'' (), which may be a kind of the Arabic language ''karkadann'', meaning "rhinoceros". In mythology and heraldry, the unicorn symbolizes innocence, purity and feminine power. It is often seen as the counterpart of the lion, which symbolizes the masculine virtues. In Western culture, a unicorn's horn is said to have power to heal wounds and sickness, and to neutralize poison. This power was often called ''alicorn'' in Middle Ages times, when stories of unicorns became more popular. People purchased expensive "unicorn horns" that were usually Narwhal horns or walrus Tusk. Christian legends say the unicorn is as small as a normal-sized Domestic goat. According to these legends, unicorns are so fearful that no hunter can catch them; only a Virginity that goes into the forest alone can catch a unicorn. The unicorn will come and fall asleep in the maiden’s lap. The unicorn is the official animal of Scotland.
