Image:Small and great circles 3d.png]] A '''great circle''' is the largest possible circle that can be drawn on a sphere, one that divides the surface into equal halves, called hemispheres. It is a circle that has the same diameter as the sphere it was drawn on. These Curve are geodesics in the sphere and all have the same circumference, that is, the length around of the circle. There are an Infinity number of great circles that can be drawn on any perfect sphere. The longitude lines on a globe all form great circles that pass through the same two Point (geometry) (the North Pole and the South Pole). The Equator is another great circle. Great Circles can be used to determine the shortest surface distance between two points on a sphere (or on the Earth). A straight line from plane Euclidean geometry corresponds to a Great Circle in Non-Euclidean geometry spherical geometry. ==Other websites== *[http://br.geocities.com/simaowilson/navisfera.html Great circle ] Category:Shapes
