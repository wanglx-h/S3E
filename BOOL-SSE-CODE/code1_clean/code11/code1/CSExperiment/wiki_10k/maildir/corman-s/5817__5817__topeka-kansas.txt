Topeka was wikt:establish in 1854 when nine white men founded the Topeka Town Association. At an election in November 1861, the people of Kansas chose Topeka as the permanent capital of the state. ==Naming history== The name ''Topeka'' is made up of three words from the Kaw people, Omaha people, and Iowa tribe Native American tribes. The first, ''to'', means "potato". The second, ''pe'' (short for ''pekae'') is an adjective meaning "good". The third, ''okae'', means "to dig". Thus, the name ''Topeka'' means "a good place to dig potatoes". The name was chosen because "[i]t was a novel name of Native American origin, wikt:euphonious [pleasing] of sound and simple". ==History and culture== Charles Sheldon and Charles Fox Parham, both important people in the history of American Christianity, were preachers in Topeka. Many historians believe that the modern Pentecostalism movement started in Monroe's church in 1901. Sheldon was a preacher in Topeka around the same time, who is famous for coming up with the phrase "What would Jesus do?"Alan F. Bearman and Jennifer L. Mills 2009. "Adapting Christianity to the Challenges of the American West", ''Kansas History: A Journal of the Central Plains'', 32(106) ''Brown v. Board of Education'' was a lawsuit that went before the United States Supreme Court in 1954. Several families sued the public school board in Topeka for the right for black students to go to the same schools as white students. The Supreme Court decided that school districts could not make students go to different schools because of their race (sociology). Today, the government has a museum in Topeka about ''Brown v. Board of Education'' and civil rights for African-Americans. ==Geography== File:Topekakansasnasa.jpg Topeka is at , in north east Kansas.
