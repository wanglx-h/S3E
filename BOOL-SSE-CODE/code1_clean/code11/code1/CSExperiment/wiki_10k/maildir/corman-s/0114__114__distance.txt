Subject: Distance
'''Distance''' is how far one thing is from another thing. It is also a measure of the space between two things. It can be measured along any path. Thus, someone who goes around in a circle has traveled a distance, even though his position has not changed. In geometry, the distance between two points ''A'' and ''B'' is sometimes written as \overline{AB}. Pythagorean theorem is often used in the calculation of distance. Distance is a scalar, and thus is different from displacement vector. Displacement is a vector that measures distance with a straight line (and in only one path). Displacement is the shortest way to travel the distance. == Examples == * One ball is 5 Foot (unit of length) from another ball. The distance between the two balls is 5 feet. * John walks at a speed of 6 kilometres per hour for one hour. John walks a distance of 6 kilometres. * A circle is a curved line. Each point on the circle is the same distance from the centre of the circle. == Related pages == * Euclidean distance * Norm (mathematics) == References == Category:Physical quantity Category:Mathematics Category:Geometry
