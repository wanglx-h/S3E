In 1968, it combined with Duval County, Florida to become one area. It is now the largest city by land area in the United States. The city's population is now about 971,319, with Duval County having around 1 million people. It is the biggest city in Florida, in the Southeast and outside Texas. The Jacksonville area, including Clay County, Florida, St. Johns County, Nassau County, and Baker County, has a population of about 1,733,937. Jacksonville sits on the St. Johns River in northeastern Florida. It is around 12 miles south of Georgia (U.S. state) and 350 miles north of Miami. The Jacksonville Beaches are nearby along the Atlantic coast. The area used to be home to the Timucua people and later was a French settlement called Fort Caroline. Jacksonville became an important port due to harbor improvements in the late 19th century. Naval Station Mayport, Naval Air Station Jacksonville, and other military bases are located there. The city's economy relies on services like banking, insurance, healthcare, and logistics. Tourism is also significant, especially related to golf with the PGA Tour headquarters nearby. People from Jacksonville are called Jacksonvillians or Jaxsons, which comes from the city's nickname, Jax. == References == ==Other websites== Category:Jacksonville, Florida Category:County seats in Florida
