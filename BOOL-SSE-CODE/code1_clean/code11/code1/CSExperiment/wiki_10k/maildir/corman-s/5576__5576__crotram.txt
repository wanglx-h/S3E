Image:Crotram NT 2200.jpg '''CROTRAM''' is a group of Croatian companies that make trams. They make a tram called TMK 2200. Crotram is a consortium (a group of companies that cooperate) made of three companies: Elektroindustrija Koncar(cro. [http://www.koncar.hr/ Končar]) and [http://www.tzv-gredelj.hr/ Gredelj], both from city of Zagreb, and Duro Dakovic (cro.[http://www.duro-dakovic.com/ Đuro Đaković]), from Slavonski Brod. Crotram sells their trams to ZET, the company that is in charge of all the Public Transport for the city of Zagreb. So far Crotram has only sold TMK 2200s to Zagreb, but they are trying to sell them in other cities. The TMK 2200 is 32 meters long, and it can go as fast as 70km/h. 202 people can ride at one time. ==Other websites== * [http://www.skyscrapercity.com/printthread.php?t=206917/ pictures of TMK 2200] * [http://www.zeljeznice.net/galerija/categories.php?cat_id=91 Gallery with pictures of TMK 2200 and some other Croatian trams] Category:Rail transport in Europe Category:Companies of Croatia
