Image:branch.agr.jpg.]] A '''branch''' is the part of a tree that grows out from the Trunk (botany) of a tree. The size of a branch may vary depending on the type of tree, the location of the branch relative to the tree, and how healthy the tree is. The term twig usually refers to a terminus, while bough refers only to branches coming directly from the trunk. Category:Basic English 850 words Category:Plant anatomy
