File:Seated Euripides Louvre Ma343.jpg '''Euripides''' (c. 480 BC–406 BC) was an Ancient Greece writer from Classical Athens who wrote about 90 Play (theatre). Only 18 of his tragedy have survived complete, more than all other surviving ancient Greek tragedies put together. A nineteenth play, ''Rhesus'' is sometimes thought to be by Euripides, but not all classicists agree on this. Euripides was the last of the three greatest Ancient Greece writers of tragedies, the others being Aeschylus and Sophocles. == Surviving plays == *''Alcestis'' (439 BC, second prize) *''Medea (play)'' (431 BC, third prize) *''Heracleidae'' (c. 430 BC) *''Hippolytus'' (428 BC, first prize) *''Andromache'' (c. 425 BC) *''Hecuba'' (c. 424 BC) *''The Suppliants'' (c. 423 BC) *''Electra'' (c. 420 BC) *''Heracles'' (c. 416 BC) *''Trojan Women'' (415 BC, second prize) *''Iphigenia'' (c. 414 BC) *''Ion'' (c. 414 BC) *''Helen'' (412 BC) *''The Phoenician Women'' (c. 410 BC) *''Orestes'' (408 BC) *''Bacchae'' and ''Iphigeneia at Aulis'' (405 BC, posthumous) *''Cyclops'' (408 BC) == Related pages == *Theatre of Ancient Greece Category:Ancient Greek writers Category:480s BC births Category:406 BC deaths
