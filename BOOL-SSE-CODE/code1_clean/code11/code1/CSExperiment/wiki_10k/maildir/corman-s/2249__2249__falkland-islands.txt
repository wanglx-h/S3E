They are an British overseas territories of the United Kingdom. Argentina disputes this, and claims their sovereignty. The Falklands War was fought over their possession during Margaret Thatcher's time as British Prime Minister. There are many islands in the group but the two biggest are East Falkland and West Falkland. As of the census of 2016, 3,398 people live on them. The people of the islands are British and speak English language. The main income for the people is from fishing and sheep farming. The Falkland Islands are about 300 miles (480km) east of Argentina. Argentina and the UK had a short war in 1982, because Argentina claims to own the islands. The war lasted 6 weeks and about 1,000 soldiers were killed. The UK defeated Argentina and after this the governments of the two countries would not negotiate (talk) with each other. In 1990, they began to have talks again, but Argentina later refused to continue talks. Oil and gas has been found below the sea around the islands. There is also oil and gas outside the sea area that belongs to the UK. This is owned by Argentina. ==History== The islands were discovered and occupied by Europeans. They were not inhabited until 1754, when a French people captain landed and founded Port Louie. The British landed in 1766 and created a settlement at Port Egmont on Saunders Island.''Toward Resolution?: The Falklands/Malvinas Dispute'', ed. Wayne S Smith (Boulder, CO: Lynne Rienner Publishers, 1991), p. 48 Spain discovered and captured Port Egmont in 1770. War was avoided by Spain giving it back to Britain in 1771.Gibran, Daniel 1998. ''The Falklands War: Britain versus the past in the South Atlantic''. Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland. Later attempts by Spanish forces from the Río de la Plata to seize Falklands were ended in 1833,At this time, Argentina did not exist. when British forces took control.Graham-Yooll, Andrew 2002. ''Imperial skirmishes: war and gunboat diplomacy in Latin America''. Oxford, England: Signal Books. In 1840, the Falkland Islands became a Crown Colony of the British Empire. ===Modern times=== The Falklands became a British Dependent Territory in 1981. This followed the British Nationality Act 1981. In 1983 the Falkland Islanders were granted British citizenship. On 18 April 1985 the ''Falkland Islands Constitution Order 1985'' came into force which increased the number of elected members of the Legislative Council to eight. It guaranteed the Falkland Islanders' rights and constitutional arrangements. In 1997, the constitution was amended with regard to voters rights. In 2002 the Falklands became a British Overseas Territory with the British Overseas Territories Act 2002. On 1 January 2009, the current constitution came into force with the ''Falkland Islands Constitution Order 2008''. This replaced the 1985 version. It was agreed on by the UK Government and the Falkland Islands Government. The new constitution provided for finance, the public service, the administration of law, and a Complaints Commissioner. ==Geography== File:Falkland Islands topographic map-en.svg The Falkland Islands have a land area of and a coastline wikt:estimated at .See: *, *.
