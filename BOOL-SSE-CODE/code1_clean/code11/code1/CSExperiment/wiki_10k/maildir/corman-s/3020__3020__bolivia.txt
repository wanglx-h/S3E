The silver Mining in Bolivia made most of Spain's money, and Spain used the Indigenous peoples Bolivians as Slavery to work in the mines. After many wars, Simón Bolívar helped Bolivia to gain its independence in 1825. After this, the country experienced a very divisive 19th century, both Politics and Race (sociology). There were strong political differences amongst Liberalism and Conservatism in Bolivia following their independence. Additionally, Creole peoples in the country dominated Bolivian society until late in the 19th century, when Indians and other Indigenous peoples communities started to uprise. A notable figure in these indigenous uprisings was Pablo Zárate Willka. Bolivia used to own some of the Pacific coast, but it lost it in 1879 in the War of the Pacific. == Geography == File:Bl-map.png]] File:Salar_de_Uyuni,_Bolivia2.jpg Bolivia is 424,135 square miles (1,098,581 square kilometre).
