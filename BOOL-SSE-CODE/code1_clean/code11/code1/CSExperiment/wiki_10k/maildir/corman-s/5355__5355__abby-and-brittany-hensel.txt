They are joined at the pelvis and each one controls one side of their body, which means they have to do things together. Brittany is on the left, and Abigail is on the right. They have two vertebral column that join at the pelvis. They have two stomachs and four lungs, and at birth they had a third arm in between their heads. The third arm was not properly developed, so it was amputation. They currently star in Abby & Brittany on TLC (TV channel). ==References== == Other websites == * * *[http://kletzenbauerzeitlichtung.homepage.t-online.de/Twins/twins.html Sites in German language with photos] *[http://www.medhunters.com/articles/sharedLives.html Shared Lives] *[https://web.archive.org/web/20040227213428/http://www.weeklyreader.com/teens/newsweek/tn_cover_story05.asp "Conjoined twins: Together vs. Apart"] from ''Teen Newsweek'' *[http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2000/conjoined_twins_transcript.shtml BBC Science on conjoined twins] *[http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,984307,00.html The Most Intimate Bond] from [http://67.102.243.28/_vti_txt Time magazine] , March 25, 1996. *[http://www.advancedmedical.tv/shows/jfl.htm Hensel documentary videos for sale] *[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAVdyHbSQYg YouTube video] *[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiSuyuOOBR8 YouTube video] Category:1990 births Category:Living people Category:Twin people from the United States Category:People from Saint Paul, Minnesota
