She served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1979 until her resignation in 1990, longer than any other British prime minister in the 20th century. She led the Conservative Party (UK) from 1975 to 1990. Thatcher was the first female British prime minister and was often known by the nickname "The Iron Lady", given to her by a journalist from the Soviet Union. Her birth name was Margaret Hilda Roberts. Thatcher studied chemistry at Somerville College, Oxford, and worked briefly as a research chemist, before becoming a barrister. She was elected Member of Parliament (United Kingdom) for Finchley in 1959. Edward Heath made her a Secretary of State in his government of 1970 to 1974. In 1975, she beat Heath in the Conservative Party leadership election to become Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom) and the first woman to lead a major British political party. In 1979, she was elected Prime Minister, and won a Landslide victory re-election in 1983 after victory in the 1982 Falklands War and the recovering economy brought a revival of support. Thatcher was re-elected for a third term with another landslide in 1987, but her support for the Community Charge ("poll tax") was very unpopular, and her more Euroscepticism views on the European Economic Community were not shared by others in her Cabinet. She resigned as Prime Minister and party leader in November 1990, after a challenge was made by Michael Heseltine to her leadership. After retiring from the House of Commons of the United Kingdom in 1992, she was given a life peerage as '''Baroness Thatcher''', which gave her the right to sit in the House of Lords. In 2013, she Death and funeral of Margaret Thatcher in London, at the age of 87. Thatcher is a Controversy figure in British political culture, but is still viewed positively in most opinion polls of British prime ministers. The debate over her Neoliberalism policies and legacy continues in the UK into the 21st century. == Early life == Margaret Roberts was born in North Parade, Grantham, Lincolnshire, on 13 October 1925. Her father was Alfred Roberts, a tobacconist originally from Northamptonshire. Her mother was Beatrice Ethel Stephenson, from Lincolnshire. She studied chemistry at Somerville College, Oxford. In her final year, she studied X-ray crystallography under Dorothy Hodgkin, who later won the Nobel Prize. She was already interested in politics, and became President of the Oxford University Conservative Association in 1946. She read political works such as Friedrich von Hayek's ''The Road to Serfdom'' (1944), which said economic intervention by government was wrong, because it gave too much power to the state. After graduating, Roberts moved to Colchester in Essex to work as a research chemist for BX Plastics. She was elected an MP in 1959. She became Secretary of State for Education in 1970. ==As Prime Minister== Thatcher directed British Army in 1982 to get back the Falkland Islands from Argentina. Argentina had taken the Falklands for a short time during the Falklands War. She had the second longest single prime ministerial term in history. She suffered from strong opposition during a coal miner's strike in 1984 and 1985. The strike took away political power from the miners' union. There was also controversy when she introduced a poll tax to Britain. This caused rioting across the country. She was forced to resign by her own party in 1990. She was replaced by John Major. In 1992, she stood down as PM. She then joined the House of Lords. From then on, she was known as "Baroness Thatcher of Kesteven". During Thatcher's years as prime minister, unemployment rose a lot. It doubled during her first term. In 1982, 3million people were unemployed. Unemployment started to decline again only in the mid- to late-1980s. Since the mid-1990s, Britain had consistently had lower unemployment than most of continental Europe. Thatcher's supporters claim this is the result of her reform of the labour market. This is disputed by her opponents. She was the subject of an Brighton hotel bombing when the Grand Brighton Hotel was bombed by the Provisional Irish Republican Army in October 1984.
