It connects that state's Upper Peninsula of Michigan and Lower Peninsula of Michigan. The bridge is long. It carries a four-lane Interstate Highway System, Interstate 75. It was built by the state of Michigan. The Mackinac Bridge passes over a strait of water that connects two Great Lakes, Lake Michigan (to the west of the bridge) and Lake Huron (to the east). At the center of the Mackinac Bridge is a long suspension span. The bridge, made of steel and concrete, hangs from wires that run down from two huge, curved cables. The government agency that runs the Mackinac Bridge charges motor vehicles a fee to drive over it. In 2020, the toll was $4.00 for an automobile. The government hangs colored lights from the big cable. The lights come on at night so that the bridge can be seen from many miles away. The Mackinac Bridge was opened in 1957. This started a major economic boom in northern Michigan as tourists drove from all over North America to see the bridge, the Great Lakes, and the northern forests. ==References== == Other websites == Category:Bridges in the United States Category:Transport in Michigan Category:Concrete bridges Category:Steel bridges Category:Buildings and structures in Michigan Category:Suspension bridges Category:1957 establishments in the United States Category:1950s establishments in Michigan
