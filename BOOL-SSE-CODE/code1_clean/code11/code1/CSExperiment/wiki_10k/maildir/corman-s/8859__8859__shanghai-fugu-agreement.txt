Subject: Shanghai Fugu Agreement
image:Fugu in Tank.jpg, a poisonous delicacy]] The '''Shanghai Fugu Agreement''' was a successful political prank which was landed on the SPD in the Germany state of Hesse in 1985. In 1985 the new Bündnis 90/Die Grünen prepared to enter into a States of Germany for the first time in its history. The first green cabinet minister in German history was going to be Joschka Fischer who later became minister of Foreign Affairs in the German Federal Government under chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. The 1985 Hesse coalition was to be based on an official policy agreement negotiated by both parties. During a final night session of the negotiations the Greens tabled a demand that Hesse join the "Shanghai Fugu Agreement". This was accepted by their tired Social Democratic counterparts and became official state policy. The Greens argued that the fugu fish is well known to be a dangerous delicacy requiring specialised chefs who mostly come from Asia. Due to expanding restrictions on work permits restaurants have found it difficult to employ such specialists. The "Shanghai Fugu Agreement" provides special regulations for certified fugu chefs internationally. The agreement was absolutely fictional but was neither discovered to be a joke by the Social Democrats during the nightly negotiations nor later by civil servants or the press who went through the coalition contracts. It took years to be discovered as the joke it was. Category:Hesse Category:Politics of Germany Category:1985 in Europe Category:1980s in Germany
