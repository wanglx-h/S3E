The country is a sovereign state in Associated state with the United States. The capital city of Federated States of Micronesia is Palikir, Pohnpei. The Federated States of Micronesia were formerly part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, a United Nations Trust Territory under US administration. In 1979, they adopted a constitution, and in 1986 independence was attained under a Compact of Free Association with the United States. Present concerns include large-scale unemployment, overfishing, and overdependence on U.S. aid. The Federated States of Micronesia is hundreds of small islands divided in seven territories in Micronesia. The term ''Micronesia'' may mean the Federated States or to the region as a whole. This area is in Oceania. == History == The first people here lived about 3000 years ago. Spain colonized the islands in 1886, but sold them to Germany 3 years later. ==Related pages== *Federated States of Micronesia national football team *List of rivers of the Federated States of Micronesia *Micronesia at the Olympics ==References== == Other websites == * [http://www.listofnewspapers.com/en/australia-oceania/micronesian-newspapers-in-federated-states-of-micronesia.html Newspapers] Category:Federated States of Micronesia Category:Spanish-speaking countries Category:English-speaking countries
