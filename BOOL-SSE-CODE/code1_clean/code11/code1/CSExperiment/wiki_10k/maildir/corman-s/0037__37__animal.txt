Animals get their energy from other living things. Usually, they eat them or are parasitism. Animals, Plant, Fungus, and some other living things have complex cells, so they are grouped together as eukaryotes. The study of animals is called zoology.Alexander, R. McNeill 1990. ''Animals''. Cambridge University Press. Cambridge. ISBN 0-521-34865-XVille C.A; Walker W.F. & Barnes R.D. 1984. ''General zoology''. SaundersHamilton, Gina. ''Kingdoms of life – Animals''. Lorenz Educational Press. The study of ancient life is called palaeontology. Most animals are motile, meaning they can move around. Animals take in oxygen, and give out carbon dioxide.Cresswell, Julia 2010. ''The Oxford Dictionary of word origins''. 2nd ed, New York: Oxford University Press. ISBN 978-0-19-954793-7 'having the breath of life', from anima 'air, breath, life'. This cellular respiration is part of their metabolism (chemical working). In both these ways they are different from plants. Also, the cells of animals have different cell membranes to other eukaryotes like plants and fungi. Plants are also multicellular eukaryotic organisms, but live by using light, water and basic chemical elements to make their tissues. ==Grouping animals== There are many different types of animals. The common animals most people know are only about 3% of the animal kingdom. When biologists look at animals, they find things that certain animals have in common. They use this to group the animals in a biological classification. Several million species may exist, but biologists have only identified about one million. Animals can mainly be divided into two main groups: the invertebrates and the vertebrates. Vertebrates have a backbone, or spine; invertebrates do not. Vertebrates are the only group to have an adaptive immune system, which may be partly responsible for their size and success.Janeway C.A. 2001. Evolution of the immune system. In ''Immunobiology'' ed Janeway et al. 5th ed, 597607. New York: Garland Science. Vertebrates are: *Fish (or 'fishes': both ways are correct) *Amphibia *Reptiles *Birds *Mammals Some invertebrates are: *Insects *Spiders *Crustacea *Molluscs (like a snail or squid) *worms *jellyfish ==Life styles== The animal mode of nutrition is called heterotrophic because they get their food from other living organisms. Some animals eat only plants; they are called herbivores. Other animals eat only meat and are called carnivores. Animals that eat both plants and meat are called omnivores. Some animals get their energy from photosynthesis protists that live inside them. The environments animals live in vary greatly. By the process of evolution, animals Adaptation to the habitats they live in. A fish is adapted to its life in water and a spider is adapted to a life catching and eating insects. A mammal living on the savannahs of East Africa lives quite a different life from a dolphin or porpoise catching fish in the sea. The fossil record of animals goes back about 600 million years to the Ediacaran period, or somewhat earlier. [https://web.archive.org/web/20160429025317/http://www.princeton.edu/geosciences/people/maloof/papers_pub/24Maloof.pdf Pdf]. These fossils are interpreted as being early sponges. They were found in 665-million-year-old rock. During the whole of this long time, animals have been constantly evolving, so that the animals alive on Earth today are very different from those on the edges of the sea-floor in the Ediacaran. ==Related pages== * List of animal phyla *Ethology, the study of animal behaviour ==References== Category:Animals Category:Basic English 850 words
