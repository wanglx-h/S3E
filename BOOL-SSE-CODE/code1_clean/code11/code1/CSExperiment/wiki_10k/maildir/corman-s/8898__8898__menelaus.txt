'''Menelaus''' (, ''Menelaos'' - "wrath of the people") is one of the central figures in Homer's ''Iliad'' and a hero of the Trojan War. He was the son of King Atreus and Queen Aerope of Mycenae, and the brother of Agamemnon. He was the king of Sparta. His wife was Helen of Troy, said to be the most beautiful woman in the world. She was kidnapped by Prince Paris (mythology) of Troy. That caused the Trojan War, as Menelaus sought to get Helen back. Prior to the war, Menelaus had one child with Helen, a daughter named Hermione (mythology). Category:People in Greek mythology Category:Kings of Sparta
