A powerful storm sweeps her and her house away to the Land of Oz. Upon arriving, she arrives in a town of people called "munchkins". She soon realises that her house has crushed a witch and now the witch's magical ruby slippers belong to her. The good witch, Glinda (Billie Burke), tells her that only the Wizard of Oz (Frank Morgan) can send her back home. She must go to the Emerald City to see him. She sets off on the Yellow Brick Road wearing the witch's ruby slippers. She makes three friends on the road: a Scarecrow, a Tin Man, and a Cowardly Lion (Ray Bolger, Jack Haley, and Bert Lahr). On the way to Emerald City, the friends are tormented by The Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton). She is the sister of the witch Dorothy killed. She wants the ruby slippers. Dorothy won't give the slippers to the witch. The friends arrive in Emerald City. The Wizard refuses to help them unless they defeat the Wicked Witch. The friends go to the Witch's castle and are captured. The Witch tries to torture the scarecrow with fire so Dorothy throws a bucket of water over the Witch, causing her to melt. In the Emerald City, the four friends are welcomed as heroes. It is revealed that the Wizard is not actually magic and is instead just an ordinary scientist. The Wizard prepares his hot air balloon to take Dorothy back to Kansas. But the balloon takes off without her. The good witch called Glinda (Billie Burke) tells Dorothy she can go home by just clicking the heels of the ruby slippers together and thinking about home. She does this. She wakes up in her bed. Her adventures have been a dream. == Main cast == * Judy Garland as Dorothy Gale * Ray Bolger as the Scarecrow * Jack Haley as the Tin Man * Bert Lahr as the Cowardly Lion * Margaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch of the West * Billie Burke as Glinda, the Good Witch * Frank Morgan as the Wizard of Oz * Clara Blandick as Aunt Em * Charlie Grapewin as Uncle Henry ==References== == Other websites == * *[http://www.filmsite.org/wiza.html Greatest Films] *[http://www.ravecentral.com/wizardofoz.html RaveCentral] *[http://www.stormtrack.org/library/fringe/oz.htm The Wizard of Oz tornado] - on the set *[http://www.moria.co.nz/fantasy/wizardofoz.htm Moria.co.nz Review] Category:1939 movies Category:1930s family movies Category:1930s fantasy movies Category:American family movies Category:American fantasy movies Category:1930s American musical movies Category:English-language movies Category:Movies based on books Category:Movies set in Kansas Category:Movies set on farms Category:United States National Film Registry movies Category:Movies that won the Best Original Song Academy Award Category:MGM movies Category:Movies directed by Victor Fleming Category:Movies about dreams Category:Movies about witchcraft Category:Movies about wizards
