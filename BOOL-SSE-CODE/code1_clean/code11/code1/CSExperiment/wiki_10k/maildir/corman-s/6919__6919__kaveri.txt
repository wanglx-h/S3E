File:Kaveri in hogenakkal.jpg '''Kaveri''' is a river, starting from Karnataka, and drains into the Bay of Bengal, in the state of Tamil Nadu. The '''Kaveri River''', also spelled Cauvery, is one of the most important rivers in South India. It flows through the Indian states of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. The river gives water to millions of people and supports farming, drinking water and electricity. The Kaveri begins in the Western Ghats, in a place called Talakaveri, located in the Coorg district of Karnataka. It travels over 800 kilometers before reaching the sea. Along the way, it passes through cities like Mysuru, Srirangam and Tiruchirappalli. Many farmers use the Kaveri River to grow crops such as rice and sugarcane. It is also used for irrigation with the help of big dams like the Krishna Raja Sagara Dam and the Mettur Dam. The river is also holy in Hindu religion. People believe that taking a bath in the Kaveri washes away sins. Many festivals and prayers happen near the river, especially during the Kaveri Pushkaram. ==References== Category:Rivers of Tamil Nadu
