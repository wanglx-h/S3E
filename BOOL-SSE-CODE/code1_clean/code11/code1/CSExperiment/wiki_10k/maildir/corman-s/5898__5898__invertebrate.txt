File:Brachypelma edit.jpg An '''invertebrate''' is an animal that does not have a spinal column or ''backbone''. This contrasts with vertebrate: if an animal is not a vertebrate (fish, reptile, amphibian, bird, or mammal), it is an invertebrate. Most animals, and most species of animal, are invertebrates. The main phyla (groups) of invertebrate animals are: * Annelida: segmented worms * Arthropods: (arachnids, crustaceans, insects, and others); the largest groups of invertebrates. * Brachiopods: the lamp-shells. * Bryozoa: sea mats or moss animals (sometimes they look like corals) * Cnidarians: jellyfish, sea anemones, hydroids. * Echinoderms: starfish, sea urchins, sea cucumbers * Molluscs: (gastropods, cephalopods, bivalves and others); a large group of invertebrates. * Nematoda: roundworms * Porifera: sponges * Platyhelminthes: flatworms * Rotifers: tiny "wheel animals", which live in habitats such as pond water. Insects and other arthropods have no bones, but they have a skeleton on the outside of their bodies, called an exoskeleton. There are 18 more groups of invertebrates, mostly minor: see List of animal phyla. Category:Invertebrates
