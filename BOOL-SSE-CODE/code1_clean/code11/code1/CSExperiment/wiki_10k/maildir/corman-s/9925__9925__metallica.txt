They are seen as pioneers of the thrash metal sub-genre of Heavy metal music. The band is one of the "Big Four" of early thrash metal, with Megadeth, Slayer, and Anthrax (American band). They are well known for many of their songs, including "Master of Puppets", "The Unforgiven", "One", "Enter Sandman", and "Nothing Else Matters". Since then, they have become one of the most popular and successful bands of metal, and have sold over 100 million Album worldwide. The band's fifth album, Metallica (album), has sold over 22 million copies, making it one of the top 20 best selling albums of all time. Metallica's current members are Guitar and singer James Hetfield, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and Bass guitar Robert Trujillo. Hetfield and Ulrich write most of the band's songs. Metallica became popular when they released their third album, ''Master of Puppets'', on March 3, 1986. It is called the band's best album. The band was nominated for a Grammy Award for their fourth album, ''...And Justice for All (album)'', in 1988. Their next album, ''Metallica'', commonly known as the "''Black Album''", was their most popular. The band's latest studio album is ''72 Seasons'', which was released on April 14, 2023. Metallica has sold over 125 million total albums. == Band history == === Band starts === The band formed after drummer Lars Ulrich placed an advertisement in a newspaper saying that he was looking for musicians to help him Cover version songs by Tygers of Pang Tang, Diamond Head, and Led Zeppelin. James Hetfield, a guitar who would become the lead singer of Metallica, answered the advertisement. Later, Lars and James would be joined by another young guitar player looking for a band named Dave Mustaine. Ulrich, Hetfield, Mustaine, and bass guitar player Ron McGovney started playing in the band. Ulrich and Hetfield saw another bass player, Cliff Burton, playing at a concert, and asked him to join the band to replace McGovney. This was because McGovney was having trouble getting along with other band members. Burton joined the band after Ulrich and Hetfield agreed to move from Los Angeles to San Francisco. In 1983, Mustaine was kicked out of the band for his drug and alcohol problems and violent behavior, and was replaced with guitarist Kirk Hammett who left his previous band, Exodus (band). Mustaine went on to form his own band named Megadeth. They became very popular in the metal scene, and have become one of Metallica's metal contemporaries, along with Slayer and Anthrax (US band). All four bands are known as the "Big Four" of thrash metal. === Successful albums === In 1983, Metallica released their first studio album ''Kill 'Em All'', on which few of the songs were still credited to Mustaine. One year later, Metallica released their second studio album ''Ride the Lightning''. "Ride the Lightning" and "The Call of Ktulu," the album's final track, were the band's last songs to give Dave Mustaine writing credits. Metallica was one of few bands at the time to deviate from the then popular hair/glam metal trend that was taking place during the 1980s, led by bands like Poison (band) and Mötley Crüe. In 1986, Metallica released their third studio album, ''Master of Puppets'', which is widely considered to be one of the greatest heavy metal albums of all time. On September 27, 1986, Cliff Burton was killed when the band's tour bus crashed in Sweden. Burton was subsequently replaced by Jason Newsted after auditioning. With Newsted as bassist, Metallica released their fourth studio album ''...And Justice for All (album)'', reaching #6 on the ''Billboard 200''. The album features the song "One," which won a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 1990. The album is criticized for its production and inaudible bass guitar, which is commonly believed to be a result of Jason Newsted's hazing, during which the other members turned down the bass guitar volume on the album. The album is also known for having much more complex song structures than previous albums. Metallica reached even greater success with their Metallica (album), which debuted at #1 on the ''Billboard'' 200 and has sold over 15 million copies in the United States. The album won a Grammy for Best Metal Performance in 1992, being Metallica's third consecutive Grammy (the second being their cover of Queen's "Stone Cold Crazy"). === Stage accident === On August 8, 1992, when the band was playing in Montreal, James Hetfield accidentally walked into a 12 foot high blast of fire on stage. He had second and third degree burns. Metallica's music shifted towards a more mainstream hard rock style, and continued their success with Load (album) and ReLoad, released in 1996 and 1997, which both debuted at #1 on the ''Billboard'' 200. Despite the albums' success, many fans were unhappy with the large change of style from Metallica's previous albums. In 1998, Metallica released Garage, Inc., which was an album of cover songs by many of the artists that influenced Metallica, such as Motörhead, Mercyful Fate, Thin Lizzy, and Blue Öyster Cult. In 2001, Newsted left Metallica to start his own project, :en:Echobrain, much against the band's wishes, particularly James Hetfield. Their eighth studio album, ''St. Anger'', was released in 2003, with producer :en:Bob_Rock playing bass after Newsted's departure. ''St. Anger'' also debuted at #1 on the ''Billboard'' 200, but was even further disliked by fans than Load and Reload. Shortly after the release of ''St. Anger'', bassist Robert Trujillo joined the band after a long auditioning process with many bassists. At Trujillo's request, his audition song was Battery, a very fast-paced song from ''Master of Puppets''. ''Death Magnetic'', the band's ninth studio album, was released in September 2008, and debuted at #1 on the ''Billboard'' 200, making Metallica the first band to achieve five consecutive #1 albums in United States. ''Death Magnetic'' showed a return to the band's thrash metal roots. From 2008 to 2010, Metallica performed their :en:World_Magnetic_Tour supporting the album's release. The tour concluded in Melbourne, Australia November 21, 2010. In June 2010, Metallica attended the Sonisphere Festival in Sofia, Bulgaria with the rest of the Big 4, alongside Anthrax, Megadeth and Slayer. Between Metallica's encores, all four bands took the stage to perform "Am I Evil?" by :en:Diamond_Head_(band). In 2011, ''Lulu (album)'', a collaboration album between Metallica and Lou Reed, was released. Many Metallica fans were dissatisfied due to stylistic differences between Reed and Metallica, but the album has managed to garner success. In October 2013, Hetfield stated in an interview that the band would start working on their next album in early 2014. In October 2020, Miley Cyrus announced that she was planning on recording a Metallica covers album and on January 7, 2021, she announced that she has recorded a cover version of "Nothing Else Matters" that would feature Elton John on piano, drummer Chad Smith from Red Hot Chili Peppers and Cellist Yo-Yo Ma. This version was produced by Andrew Watt (musician), and was released as a promotional single for the tribute album ''The Metallica Blacklist.'' ==Style and lyrical themes== Metallica played Thrash metal}} and speed metal}} on their first four albums before changing their sound to traditional Heavy metal music}} on 1991's ''Metallica (album)''. ''Load (album)'' and ''Reload (Metallica album)'', released in 1996 and 1997 respectively, saw the band move towards hard rock. 2008's ''Death Magnetic'' saw them returning to a more thrash-influenced sound. They's music has been described as Heavy metal music, thrash metal, speed metal and hard rock Metallica was influenced by early heavy metal and hard rock bands and artists Blue Öyster Cult, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Kiss (band), Led Zeppelin, Queen (band), Ted Nugent, AC/DC, Rush (band), Aerosmith, and Judas Priest and by new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) bands Raven (British band), Venom (band), Motörhead, Saxon (band), Diamond Head (British band), Blitzkrieg (metal band), and Iron Maiden as well as European bands Scorpions (band), Accept (band), and Mercyful Fate. Early punk rock bands Ramones, Sex Pistols, and the The Misfits also influenced Metallica's style as did post-punk band Killing Joke and hardcore punk acts Discharge (band), GBH (band), and Suicidal Tendencies. Lars Ulrich has cited Iron Maiden as probably the biggest influence on Metallica's career. The band's early releases contained fast tempos, harmonized leads, and nine-minute instrumental tracks. Steve Huey of AllMusic said ''Ride the Lightning'' featured "extended, progressive epics; tight, concise groove-rockers". He also said Metallica expanded its compositional technique and range of expression to take on a more aggressive approach in following releases, and lyrics dealt with personal and socially conscious issues. |access-date=December 8, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923150541/http://www.cmc.dk/ |archive-date=September 23, 2010 }} Religious and military leaders, rage, insanity, monsters, and drugsamong other themeswere explored on ''Master of Puppets''. |access-date=December 8, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923150541/http://www.cmc.dk/ |archive-date=September 23, 2010 }} In 1991, Huey said Metallica with new producer Bob Rock simplified and streamlined its music for a more commercial approach to appeal to mainstream audiences. Robert Palmer (American writer) of ''Rolling Stone'' said the band abandoned its aggressive, fast tempos to expand its music and expressive range (music). The change in direction proved commercially successful; ''Metallica'' was the band's first album to peak at number one on the ''Billboard''200. Metallica noticed changes to the rock scene created by the grunge movement of the early-1990s. In ''Load''—an album that has been described as having "an almost alternative rock" approach—the band changed musical direction again and focused on non-metal influences. Metallica's new lyrical approach moved away from drugs and monsters, and focused on anger, loss, and retribution. Some fans and critics were not pleased with this change, which included haircuts, the cover art of ''Load'', and headlining the Lollapalooza festival of 1996. David Fricke of ''Rolling Stone'' described the move as "goodbye to the moldy stricture and dead-end Puritanism of no-frills thrash", and called ''Load'' the heaviest record of 1996. With the release of ''ReLoad'' in 1997, the band displayed blues and early hard rock influences, incorporating more rhythm and harmony in song structures. ''St. Anger'' marked another large change in the band's sound. Guitar solos were excluded from the album, leaving a "raw and unpolished sound". The band used drop C tuning; Ulrich's snare drum received particular criticism. ''New York Magazine''s Ethan Brown said it "reverberates with a thwong". The album's lyrics deal with Hetfield's drug rehabilitation and include references to the devil, anti-drug themes, claustrophobia, impending doom, and religious hypocrisy. At the advice of producer Rick Rubin, for its ninth studio album ''Death Magnetic'', the band returned to standard tuning and guitar solos. As a return to Metallica's thrash roots, ''Death Magnetic'' was a ostinato#Riff-oriented album featuring intense guitar solos and subtle lyrics about suicide and redemption. == Band members == ;Current lineup * James Hetfield – lead vocals, rhythm guitar (1981–present) * Lars Ulrich – drums (1981–present) * Kirk Hammett – lead guitar, backing vocals (1983–present) * Robert Trujillo – bass, backing vocals (2003–present) ;Former * Dave Mustaine – lead guitar, backing vocals (1982–1983) * Ron McGovney – bass (1982) * Cliff Burton – bass, backing vocals (1982–1986; died 1986) * Jason Newsted – bass, backing vocals (1986–2001) '''Timeline''' TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy Legend = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:1 ScaleMajor = increment:3 start:1982 ScaleMinor = increment:1 start:1982 Colors = id:vocals value:red legend:Lead_vocals,_rhythm_guitar id:back value:pink legend:Backing_vocals id:guitar value:green legend:Lead_guitar id:bass value:blue legend:Bass id:drums value:orange legend:Drums id:studio value:black legend:Studio_album id:live value:gray(0.75) legend:Live_release LineData = layer:back color:studio at:07/25/1983 at:07/27/1984 at:03/03/1986 at:08/25/1988 at:08/13/1991 at:06/04/1996 at:11/18/1997 at:06/05/2003 at:09/12/2008 at:11/18/2016 at:04/14/2023 color:live at:11/23/1993 at:11/23/1999 at:11/03/2009 at:09/20/2010 at:11/02/2010 at:11/12/2010 at:11/26/2010 at:04/16/2016 at:03/01/2019 at:05/15/2020 at:04/18/2020 at:04/18/2020 at:04/18/2020 BarData = bar:James text:"James Hetfield" bar:Dave text:"Dave Mustaine" bar:Kirk text:"Kirk Hammett" bar:Ron text:"Ron McGovney" bar:Cliff text:"Cliff Burton" bar:Jason text:"Jason Newsted" bar:Rob text:"Robert Trujillo" bar:Lars text:"Lars Ulrich" PlotData = width:11 bar:James from:10/28/1981 till:end color:vocals bar:Dave from:03/14/1982 till:04/11/1983 color:guitar bar:Kirk from:04/12/1983 till:end color:guitar bar:Ron from:03/14/1982 till:12/10/1982 color:bass bar:Cliff from:12/10/1982 till:09/27/1986 color:bass bar:Jason from:11/08/1986 till:01/17/2001 color:bass bar:Rob from:02/24/2003 till:end color:bass bar:Lars from:10/28/1981 till:end color:drums width:3 bar:Dave from:03/14/1982 till:04/11/1983 color:back bar:Kirk from:04/12/1983 till:end color:back bar:Cliff from:12/10/1982 till:09/27/1986 color:back bar:Jason from:11/08/1986 till:01/17/2001 color:back bar:Rob from:02/24/2003 till:end color:back }} ==Discography== * ''Kill 'Em All'' (1983) * ''Ride the Lightning'' (1984) * ''Master of Puppets'' (1986) * ''Garage Days Re-Revisited'' (1987) * ''...And Justice for All (album)'' (1988) * ''Metallica (album)'' (1991) * ''Load (album)'' (1996) * ''ReLoad'' (1997) * ''Garage, Inc.''
