File:Polea-simple-fija.jpg File:Polea-simple-movil2.jpg A '''pulley''' is a simple machine that is used to lift heavy objects. Block and tackle system is a modified form of a pulley. Pulleys are usually used in sets designed to make the amount of Force (physics) needed to lift something smaller.A pulley may be simple, but this is used in complex things like elevators! ==Types of pulleys== * '''Static''' A ''static'' or ''class 1'' pulley has an axle that is "staticed" or is stationary, meaning that it cannot be moved. A fixed pulley is used to redirect the force in a rope (called a belt (mechanical) when it goes in a full circle). A fixed pulley has a mechanical advantage of 1. The static pulley has a wheel and an axle. * '''Movable''' A ''movable'' or ''class 2'' pulley has an axle that is "free" to move in Space (physics). A movable pulley is used to transform forces. A movable pulley has a mechanical advantage of 2. That is, if one end of the rope is anchored, pulling on the other end of the rope will apply a doubled force to the objecT attached to the pulley. * '''Compound''' A ''compound pulley'' is a combination fixed and movable pulley system. ** Block and tackle - A ''block and tackle'' is a compound pulley where several pulleys are mounted on each axle, further increasing the mechanical advantage. Plutarch reported that Archimedes moved an entire warship, laden with men, using compound pulleys and his own strength. Pulleys are useful in construction sites. Category:Mechanics Category:Tools
