File:Rugby World Cup Trophy.JPG The '''Rugby World Cup''' is the most important tournament in the sport of rugby union. The first one was in 1987. The cup happens every four years. The competition is one of the biggest sporting events in the world (along with the FIFA World Cup and the Olympics). There are only 20 spots available in a Rugby World Cup, so teams must compete for them in a qualifying competition. Teams that reached the knockout stages of the previous tournament automatically qualify for the next tournament. The 2019 competition was held in Japan, with South Africa winning. The current 2024 champions are South Africa. == Results by nation == {| class="wikitable sortable mw-collapsible" |- !width=170| Team !width=140| Champions !width=140| Runners-up !width=130| Third place !width=120| Fourth place !width=60| Top 2 !width=60| Top 4 |- | style="background:#fff68f" | South Africa national rugby union team | style="background:#fff68f" |'''4''' (1995 Rugby World Cup, 2007 Rugby World Cup) | align="center" |— |'''2'''(1999 Rugby World Cup, 2015 Rugby World Cup) | align="center" |— | align="center" |2 | align="center" |4 |- |style=background:#fff68f| New Zealand national rugby union team |style=background:#fff68f|'''3''' (1987 Rugby World Cup, 2011 Rugby World Cup, 2015 Rugby World Cup) |'''1''' (1995 Rugby World Cup) |'''2''' (1991 Rugby World Cup, 2003 Rugby World Cup) |'''1''' (1999 Rugby World Cup) |align=center|4 |align=center|7 |- |style=background:#fff68f| Australia national rugby union team |style=background:#fff68f|'''2''' (1991 Rugby World Cup, 1999 Rugby World Cup) |'''2''' (2003 Rugby World Cup, 2015 Rugby World Cup) |'''1''' (2011 Rugby World Cup) |'''1''' (1987 Rugby World Cup) |align=center|4 |align=center|6 |- |style=background:#fff68f| England national rugby union team |style=background:#fff68f|'''1''' (2003 Rugby World Cup) |'''2'''(1991 Rugby World Cup, 2007 Rugby World Cup) |align=center| — |'''1'''(1995 Rugby World Cup) |align=center|3 |align=center|4 |- | France national rugby union team |align=center|— |'''3'''(1987 Rugby World Cup, 1999 Rugby World Cup, 2011 Rugby World Cup) |'''1'''(1995 Rugby World Cup) |'''2'''(2003 Rugby World Cup, 2007 Rugby World Cup) |align=center|3 |align=center|6 |- | Argentina national rugby union team |align=center|— |align=center|— |'''1'''(2007 Rugby World Cup) |'''1'''(2015 Rugby World Cup) |align=center|0 |align=center|2 |- |Wales |— |— |1(1987) |— |0 |1 |- | Scotland national rugby union team |align=center|— |align=center|— |align=center|— |'''1'''(1991 Rugby World Cup) |align=center|0 |align=center|1 |} == Other websites == * – official site *[http://www.worldrugby.org/ World Rugby] Category:Rugby union
