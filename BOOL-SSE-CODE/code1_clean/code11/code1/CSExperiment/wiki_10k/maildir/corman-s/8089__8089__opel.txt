From 1929 to 2017, Opel is the German brand of the American automaker General Motors. Opel has about 35,000 workers. The company headquarters are in Rüsselsheim, Germany. Other German plants are in Eisenach and Kaiserslautern. In Great Britain, Opel cars are called Vauxhall Motors. Opel would later engineer cars for Daewoo Motors and GM Korea until the Opel brand was bought by PSA. From 2007 to 2009 three Opel models (the Antara, the Astra and the Vectra) were sold in the United States under the Saturn marque. Upon the discontinuation of the Saturn marque, Buick became responsible for importing the Opel models. The only Buick cars to not be Opels are the Buick Enclave CUV and the full sized LaCrosse sedan. In March 2017, Opel and its parent brand Vauxhall were bought by PSA, the company who owns Peugeot and Citroën. 1862 File:Opel Manta A at Schaffen-Diest in 2018.jpg File:Nationale oldtimerdag Zandvoort 2010, 1978 OPEL KADETT COUPE ,79-UG-66.JPG == Car models == '''Passenger cars:''' Citroën Ami (quadricycle) | Opel Astra | Opel Corsa | Opel Mokka | Opel Crossland | Opel Grandland | Citroën Jumpy '''Commercial cars:''' Citroën Berlingo | Citroën Jumpy | Fiat Ducato '''Concept cars:''' Antara GTC | Astra OPC X-Treme | Eco Speedster | Flextreme | Flextreme GT/E | Frogster | GTC Concept | GT Concept | Insignia Concept | Monza Concept | Manta GSe Electromod | RAK e | Snowtrekker | Trixx '''Historic cars:''' Opel Adam | Opel Antara | Opel Ampera | Opel Agila | Admiral | Ascona | Blitz | Calibra | Opel Cascada | Commodore | Diplomat | Frontera | GT | Opel Insignia | Opel Karl | Opel Meriva | Kadett | Kapitän | Manta | Monterey | Monza | Olympia | Omega | Rekord | Senator | Opel Signum | Opel Sintra | Speedster | Tigra | Opel Vectra | Opel Zafira == References == == Other websites == * [http://www.opel.com/ Opel's Corporate Website] Category:1862 establishments in Europe Category:1860s establishments in Germany Category:Stellantis Category:Automobile companies of Germany Category:Hesse Category:Opel automobiles
