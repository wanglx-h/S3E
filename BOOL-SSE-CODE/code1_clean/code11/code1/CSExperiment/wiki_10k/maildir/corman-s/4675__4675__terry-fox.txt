He lost one of his legs because of bone cancer when he was 18. He is best known for The Marathon of Hope. This was a run across Canada (with the help of an artificial leg). It started on April 12, 1980 in St. John's, Newfoundland. He did the run to get people to Donation money to cancer research. He wanted to run until he got to Vancouver Island. To do this, he planned to run across the country. The goal of the run was to raise 1 million Canadian dollars for cancer research. It was later to raise one dollar for every person in Canada. Many people helped him during his run. He ran about the distance of a marathon every day. On August 31, 1980, near the town of Thunder Bay, Ontario, Fox's cancer metastasis to his lungs. He had to stop running. Fox died on , in New Westminster, British Columbia. He died a month before his 23rd birthday. Fox was made a Companion in the Order of Canada before he died. He is the youngest person to be a Companion. There is a statue of him in Ottawa (Canada's capital city), near Parliament Hill. Many schools are named after him, such as the high school he was a student at. He has been put on the Canadian Canadian dollar1 coin. Fox inspired many Canadians to help people with cancer. Every year, there is the Terry Fox Run. It is a run that gives money to cancer research. As of September 2022, the run has given over 850 million Canadian dollars to cancer research. == Early life and cancer == File:Terry-Fox-prosthetic-leg.jpg.]] Terry Fox was born on July 28, 1958, in Winnipeg. His father worked for the Canadian National Railway. Fox had three siblings: an older brother named Fred, a younger brother named Darrell, and a younger sister named Judith. In 1966, they moved to Surrey, British Columbia. In 1968, they moved again to Port Coquitlam. Terry attended Glen Elementary, Mary Hill Junior Secondary, and Port Coquitlam Senior Secondary (the latter was eventually re-named Terry Fox Senior Secondary in his honour in 1986). The family remained in Port Coquitlam. Fox did not like losing. He would keep doing something until he won.Inwood, Damian (September 18, 2005). "Terry Fox: 25 years; Celebrating his dream: a 12-page special section honouring the 25th Annual Terry Fox Run". ''Vancouver Province''. Fox wanted to join his school's basketball team, but had trouble because he was short. His coach told him to do Cross-country race running. Fox started running, and practiced playing basketball. He got better at basketball, and won an award for it when he was in high school. Fox went to Simon Fraser University after high school. He studied how the human body moves, because he wanted to teach physical education. Fox was on a basketball team for the university. On November 12, 1976, Fox was driving to Port Coquitlam when he crashed his car into a truck. He hurt his knee in the crash, but did not do anything about it until he stopped playing basketball in March. His knee started hurting more, so he went to a hospital. The doctors told him he had Bone tumor in his knee. Fox thought that he got cancer because he hurt his knee in the crash. His doctors told him this was not true. He had to have his leg amputated. He also needed chemotherapy. Fox got a Prosthesis so he could still walk. He was able to walk three weeks after his leg was removed, and had to do chemotherapy for sixteen months. In 1977, Rick Hansen asked Fox to join his wheelchair basketball team.Edwards, Peter (January 3, 1987). "Man in Motion set to honour pal Terry Fox". ''Toronto Star''. p. A13. Less than two months after learning how to play the sport, Fox played at the national championship for it. He won three national titles playing wheelchair basketball. == Marathon of Hope == File:Terry Fox Sculpture.jpg The day before he got cancer surgery, Fox read about a man named Dick Traum. Dick Traum was the first Amputation to finish the New York City Marathon. The story inspired Fox, and he practiced running for fourteen months. He told his family he wanted to run a marathon, but he wanted to run much longer. Fox was mad because cancer research did not get very much money. He wanted to run across Canada to get people to give money to cancer research. The only person he told this to was his friend, Douglas Alward. Fox had to run in a special way because of his leg. He had to do small jumps on his real leg for each step so his fake leg worked. Practicing running was painful because Fox had to run this way. He noticed that after 20 minutes of running, he got used to the pain and the running would hurt less. On September 2, 1979, Fox ran in a 17-mile (27 km) road race in Prince George, British Columbia. He was the last one to finish the race. Many people cheered for him when he finished. After the race, he told his family he wanted to run across Canada. His mother told him not to, and he got mad. She later supported Fox's run. Fox wanted to get $1 million for cancer research. The Canadian Encyclopedia|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/25th-anniversary-of-terry-foxs-marathon-of-hope|access-date=2022-11-30|website=www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca}} Later, he wanted to get $10 million, and then a dollar for every person who lived in Canada (24 million people). === Before the run === In October 1979, Fox wrote a letter to the Canadian Cancer Society. He told them about what he wanted to do. He asked them to give him money so he could start the run. He told them that he was going to finish the run, even if he had to "crawl every last mile". The Cancer Society did not know if he was going to finish the run, but they supported him once a doctor said that he was able to run. The Ventricle (heart) of Fox's heart was larger than normal. Doctors told Fox about the risks of the run. They did not think his heart was a problem. They supported his run when he told them he was going to stop running if he had heart problems. Fox wrote to many companies. He asked them for money so he could do the run. He also wrote letters asking for money for a fake leg he could use for running. The Ford Motor Company gave him a Campervan, and Imperial Oil gave him fuel for it. Adidas gave him running shoes. Fox did not take money from companies that wanted him to Advertising what they sold. He only wanted cancer research to get money from his run. === Marathon of Hope === The Marathon of Hope started on April 12, 1980. Fox started it when he put his fake leg into the Atlantic Ocean, on the coast of St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador. He also filled two bottles with water from the ocean. He wanted to keep one to remember the run, and pour the other into the Pacific Ocean when he finished in Victoria, British Columbia. Fox's friend, Douglas Alward, helped him by giving him food and driving the van. When he started the Marathon of Hope, Fox had to run through very bad weather. He ran through strong wind, rain, and snow before he got to Channel-Port aux Basques. The 10,000 people in the town cheered for him. They gave him $10,000. During the run, Fox got angry at people he thought were stopping him from running. He also got mad at Alward. Fox's brother, Darrell, joined them when they got to Nova Scotia. This was so Fox did not get mad at Alward as much.File:Terry Fox Monument in Ottawa.JPG.|left]]When he ran through Quebec, Fox had many problems because he could not speak French. Many people driving cars also tried to get him off the road. Fox got to Montreal on June 22. By the time he was in Montreal, people had given $200,000 to cancer research. The creator of Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, Isadore Sharp, let Fox's group stay at his hotel and get food. He also said he was going to donate $2 for every mile Fox ran. Sharp got almost 1,000 other people to also do this.Martin, Obituary: Betty Fox kept Marathon of Hope Pure..., The Globe and Mail, Friday June 17, 2011 This was because Sharp's son died of cancer, so he wanted Fox to finish his run. The Canadian Cancer Society told Fox that more people would donate to cancer research if he got to Ottawa on Canada Day (July 1). He stayed in Montreal for a few more days to do this. Fox came to Ontario on June 28. Many people were on the roads to cheer for him. The Ontario Provincial Police protected him with police cars while he ran. Even though it was very hot, he still ran 26 miles (42 km) every day. When he got to Ottawa, he met Pierre Trudeau, the Prime Minister of Canada. He was also honored at many sports games in the city. He did a kickoff (kicking the ball from the middle of the field to start a American football game) at a Canadian Football League game. Fox was excited that he was being honored. On July 11, Fox ran to Toronto. 10,000 people were cheering for Fox when he came into the city. Darryl Sittler, a National Hockey League player, gave him one of his hockey jerseys while he was running. He threw the Ceremonial first pitch at a baseball game between the Toronto Blue Jays and Cleveland Guardians. Bobby Orr, a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame, met Fox and gave him $25,000 for cancer research. Fox thought meeting Orr was the best part of the run. The Cancer Society got around $100,000 on July 11. Fox was getting more popular. The Cancer Society asked him to go to more events and speak to more people. Fox tried to do as much as he could to raise money, even if it made him run more than he needed to. Newspapers such as the ''Toronto Star'' started writing news about his personal life. He did not like this. Some newspapers wrote negative news about Fox, such as ''The Globe and Mail'' writing that he was only running because a doctor did not give him the correct diagnosis. Fox said this news was "trash".Johnson, Arthur (August 15, 1980). "Runner bears grudge against pain of illness in marathon of hope". ''The Globe and Mail''. === End of the run and Canadian response === File:Marathon of Hope Map.png Fox did not stop running during the Marathon of Hope, except for when he took the break in Montreal. He even ran on his 22nd birthday. He often had pain in his lower legs, and got Cyst on the end of his right leg. He also got Dizziness many times. At one point, his ankle hurt for a long time. Fox thought that he Bone fracture it, but he ran for three days until he went to a doctor. The doctor told him it was tendonitis (a type of inflammation in the tendon), and that it could get better with Analgesic. In late August, Fox said he was tired before he even started running each day. On September 1, outside Thunder Bay, Fox stopped because he had pain in his chest. He kept running because people cheered him on. After running a few more miles, he still had chest pain, and had Dyspnea. He asked Alward to drive him to a hospital. The next day, Fox told reporters that his cancer came back, and Metastasis into his lungs. He ended the run early, after 143 days and 5,373 kilometres (3,339 mi). People wanted to run the rest of the marathon for Fox, but he told them not to. This was because he wanted to do it himself. People gave $1.7 million (equal to $5.7 million in 2022) to cancer research by the time he stopped running. A week after the run ended, CTV Television Network did a telethon (a television Fundraising) for Fox and the Canadian Cancer Society.[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vTMyAAAAIBAJ&pg=2345%2C3013106 "TV show raises $9 million for cancer"].

Fox liked the idea, but said that the run should not be a competition. The Cancer Society did not want there to be a run, because they thought that another fundraiser would mean people were going to give less money to other cancer fundraisers.Scrivener, Terry (September 13, 1987). "A millionaire keeps Terry's memory alive". ''Toronto Star''. p. D1. Sharp and the Fox family did the fundraiser anyways. The first Terry Fox Run was on September 13, 1981. There is one every year. Over 300,000 people went to the first Terry Fox Run. The first run made over $3.5 million, which was given to cancer research. People started doing Terry Fox Runs in other countries. In 1999, 60 different countries had Terry Fox Runs. They raised $15 million in 1999. The Terry Fox Run is the world's largest one-day fundraiser for cancer research. As of May 2022, over $850 million has been given to cancer research because of the Terry Fox Run. === Movies and music === Fox's story was made into a movie named ''The Terry Fox Story'' in 1983. HBO produced the movie. It was put on television in the United States, and played in movie theatres in Canada. Eric Fryer acted as Terry Fox in the movie. He won a Genie Awards for Best Actor in 1984 after being in the movie. The movie won a Genie Award for Best Picture, and won three other Genie Awards as well. Movie critics gave ''The Terry Fox Story'' good and bad reviews. In 2005, CTV Television Network made a movie named ''Terry (movie)''. Shawn Ashmore acted as Fox. Ashmore has two legs, so CTV edited the movie to make it look like he only had one. Fox's family liked ''Terry'' more than ''The Terry Fox Story''. Canadian basketball player Steve Nash made a documentary about Fox named ''Into the Wind'' in 2010. Rod Stewart made a song about Fox named "Never Give Up on a Dream". He put it on his album, ''Tonight I'm Yours'' (1981). Stewart also named his concert tour in Canada the "Terry Fox Tour". In 1981, Ian Thomas (Canadian musician) made a song named "Runner". The song is about the Marathon of Hope. ''The Terry Fox Story'' had the song in it. In 1984, Manfred Mann (musician) made a cover version of the song.''Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955-1990'' - === Other runs === Other people ran across Canada before Fox did. In 1974, Mark Kent ran across Canada to get money for the Canadian team at the 1976 Summer Olympics. He started in Victoria, British Columbia on June 29, and ended in St. John's on October 18. Kent did not go to the 1976 Olympics after the run because he had pain in his back. Fox did not let anyone else run the Marathon of Hope for him when he was alive. He said that he would finish it when he was healthy again. In 1984, Steve Fonyo started a run because of Fox's run. Fonyo was 18. He had the same type of cancer that Fox had, and he also lost one of his legs. Fonyo named his run the "Journey for Lives". He started the run in St. John's on March 31, and finished on May 29, 1985. People donated over $13 million to cancer research because of Fonyo's run. Canadian Paralympic Games athlete Rick Hansen was also inspired by the Marathon of Hope. He knew Fox because they played wheelchair basketball together. Hansen wanted to go around the world in his wheelchair. He started the Man in Motion World Tour in 1985. Hansen wanted to get $10 million to help research spinal cord injuries. He started in Vancouver on March 21. During the tour, he went through 34 countries, such as the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and China. Rick Hansen Foundation|url=https://www.rickhansen.com/about-rick/man-motion-world-tour/tour-timeline|access-date=2024-06-03|website=www.rickhansen.com|language=en}} He ended the tour in May 1987, and got over $26 million for research. During the tour, Hansen travelled over 40,000 kilometres. === Fox's disability === Fox did not call himself Disability. He told a radio station that life was more "rewarding" since he lost his leg. His run helped change how Canadians look at disabled people. Fox's run also showed disability in a positive way. People have said that Fox's run has made the media focus on people with disabilities doing very large things, instead of looking at them do normal things. Others have also said the way the media showed Fox made it seem as if a disability was only a problem for the person with it, instead of it also being a problem based on how others look at people with disabilities. == References == == Other websites == * [http://www.terryfoxrun.org/english/home/default.asp?s=1 The Terry Fox Foundation] * [http://www.histori.ca/minutes/minute.do?id=14213&sl=e History Minute PSA] * [http://www.cbc.ca/terryfox/ More about Fox, including interviews and news reports] Category:1958 births Category:1981 deaths Category:Canadian activists Category:Cancer deaths in British Columbia Category:Deaths from bone cancer Category:Sportspeople from British Columbia Category:Disability activists Category:Canadian sportspeople with disabilities Category:Deaths from lung cancer
