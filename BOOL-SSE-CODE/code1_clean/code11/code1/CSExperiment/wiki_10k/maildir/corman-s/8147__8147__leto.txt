'''Leto''' is a goddess in Greek mythology. She was the daughter of Koios and Phoebe (titan), who were Titan (mythology). Leto was the mother of the twins Artemis and Apollo, whose father was Zeus. After the twins were born, Leto played very little part in Greek mythology. She is the goddess of motherhood and one of Zeus' many wives. ==Birth of Artemis and Apollo== Hera, who was Zeus's wife, discovered that Leto was pregnant and became very angry. She banned Leto from giving birth on any mainland or island known. Leto found the island of Delos, which floated and so was not an island nor mainland, and gave birth there. Leto gave birth to Artemis without any problem. However she was in childbirth with Apollo for nine days and nine nights. Artemis helped Leto to give birth to Apollo. ==Related pages== *Latona Fountain Category:Titans
