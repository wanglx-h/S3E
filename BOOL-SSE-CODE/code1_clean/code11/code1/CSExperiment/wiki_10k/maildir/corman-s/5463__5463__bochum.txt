It is part of the Arnsberg Government Region. Bochum is situated between the cities of Essen, Dortmund, Gelsenkirchen, and Hattingen. Bochum has about 380,000 inhabitants. The city is formed by the traditional industry of coal mining in the Ruhr area, but today there is no mining in Bochum anymore. ==Education== Today the most important institution in Bochum is the Ruhr-University Bochum, one of the biggest German universities. It has an extremely wide spectrum of subjects, beginning with mathematics and science, social sciences, economy, engineering, laws, philosophy, historical subjects, theology, medicine, and languages even including Chinese language and Polish language. ==Culture== Bochum has a rich cultural life and its theatre is one of the most prominent in Germany. The Folkwang University of Art has its well known theatre centre in the Ehrenfeld neighbourhood of Bochum, educating a quite small group of students in the theatrical arts. The ''Bermuda3eck'' (Bermuda Triangle) is a well known area for night life in central Bochum such as bars, Nightclub, and Hookah. It has over 60 bars and restaurants, serving many kinds of food and drinks from both Germany and abroad. Since 1986, the Bochum total music festival has taken place in the ''Bermuda3eck'', with many live music performances. Bochum Total usually takes place for four days around the start of July, and is one of the largest free music festivals in Europe. The German Mining Museum is also in Bochum, and has a number of permanent and temporary exhibits which cover the history of coal's uses and how it is mined. The Zeiss Planetarium nearby has a number of shows featuring animations and recordings of space, along with music such as Pink Floyd The Dark Side of the Moon. == References == Category:Bochum
