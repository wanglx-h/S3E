It was built in 1784. It is a museum of medical history today.]] A '''psychiatric hospital''' is a residential institution where people with Mental illness can be kept safe and receive treatment. On some occasions, a person might choose to enter a psychiatric hospital to address their mental health. On other occasions, people can be forced into psychiatric facilities if a doctor thinks they are a danger to others or themselves. Medical doctor who work at psychiatric hospitals are called psychiatrists. ==History== === "Lunatic asylums" === Psychiatric hospitals used to be called lunatic asylums. Earlier asylums like the old Bethlem Royal Hospital in London (nicknamed "Bedlam") were like prisons. Patients received no treatment and were often imprisoned and chained. When he took over Bethlem, Philippe Pinel made a radical change: he got rid of the chains in his asylum. === Institutionalization === In the 19th century, new asylums were built. These were designed to be pleasant places with Garden and airy rooms, and later became known as psychiatric hospitals. Although they no longer looked like prisons, patients still had little freedom or hope of leaving. Many experienced ''institutionalisation'' - they had lived in the hospital for so long that they could not cope with living outside of it. === Deinstitutionalisation === In the middle of the 20th century, new drugs were invented that made it easier to treat mental illness. Governments began to look for ways to care for patients outside of hospitals. They believed it would lead to better care for patients and save money. This is known as ''deinstitutionalisation''. Since the 1970s, many countries have closed large numbers of psychiatric hospitals. Mentally ill patients are now also cared for in local hospitals, small clinics and in their own homes.
