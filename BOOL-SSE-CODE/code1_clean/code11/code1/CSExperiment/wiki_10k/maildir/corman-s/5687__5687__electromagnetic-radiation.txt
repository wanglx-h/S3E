File:Electromagnetic-Spectrum.svg '''Electromagnetic waves''' are Wave (physics) that contain an electric field and a magnetic field and carry energy. They travel at the speed of lightThis is always defined as the speed of propagation in a vacuum Speeds through various material substances vary. (299,792,458 meters per second). Quantum mechanics developed from the study of electromagnetic waves. This field includes the study of both visible and invisible light. Visible light is the light one can see with normal eyesight in the colours of the rainbow. Invisible light is light one can't see with normal eyesight and includes more energetic and higher frequency waves, such as ultraviolet, x-rays and gamma rays. Waves with longer wavelengthss, such as infrared, microwave and radio waves, are also explored in the field of Quantum mechanics. Some types of electromagnetic radiation, such as X-rays, are ionizing radiation and can be harmful to your body. Ultraviolet rays are near the violet end of the light spectrum and infrared are near the red end. Infrared rays are used as heat rays and ultraviolet rays cause sunburn. The various parts of the electromagnetic spectrum differ in wavelength, frequency and Quantum mechanics energy. Sound are not electromagnetic waves but waves of pressure in air, water or any other substance. ==Mathematical formulation== In physics, it is well known that the '''wave equation''' for a typical wave is \nabla ^2 f=\frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial t^2} The problem now is to prove that Maxwell's equations explicitly prove that the electric and magnetic fields create electromagnetic radiation. Recall that two of Maxwell's equations are given by \nabla \times \mathbf{E}=-\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} \nabla \times \mathbf{B}=\mu_o \mathbf{j}+\mu_o \varepsilon_o \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} By evaluating the curl of the above equations and vector calculus one can prove the following equations \nabla ^2 \mathbf{E}=\frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} \nabla^2 \mathbf {B}=\frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} Note: the proof involves making the substitution c=\frac{1}{\sqrt {\mu_o \varepsilon_o}} The equations above are analogous to the wave equation, by replacing '''f''' with '''E''' and '''B'''. The above equations mean that propagations through the magnetic ('''B''') and electric ('''E''') fields will produce waves. == Related pages == * Photon == References == * * * * * * ==Other websites== *[http://physnet.org/home/modules/pdf_modules/m210.pdf '' Electromagnetic Waves from Maxwell's Equations ''] on [http://www.physnet.org Project PHYSNET]. *[http://www.sengpielaudio.com/calculator-wavelength.htm Conversion of frequency to wavelength and back - electromagnetic, radio and sound waves] *[http://www.rfzone.org/free-rf-ebooks/ eBooks on Electromagnetic radiation and RF] *[http://www.scienceofspectroscopy.info The Science of Spectroscopy] - supported by NASA.
