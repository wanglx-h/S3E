A 25% of the world's countries are island countries. Island countries are historically more stable than continental countries but they're vulnerable for conquest by any naval superpowers. Indonesia is the island country with the most people in the world. There are many variations between island country economies: they may rely mainly on extractive industries, such as mining, fishing and agriculture, and/or on services such as transit hubs, tourism, and financial services. == List == There are at least 45 island countries in the world, and there are countries that only consist of an island, such as Iceland or Nauru, an archipelago, such as Federated States of Micronesia or Palau. This list also includes Australia, though a continent. {| class="wikitable sortable" ! Country ! ISO-3166 code ! Area ! Population ! Capital ! Official languages !
