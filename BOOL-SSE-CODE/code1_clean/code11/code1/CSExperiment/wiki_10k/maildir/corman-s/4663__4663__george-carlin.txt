He was known for his dark comedy and jokes about politics, the English language, psychology, religion, and taboo. ==Early life== Carlin was born and raised in Manhattan, New York City. Carlin said that he started to appreciate effective use of the English language because of his mother, though they had a difficult relationship and he often ran away from home. He grew up on West 121st Street in the Morningside Heights neighborhood of Manhattan, which he and his friends called "White Harlem" because it "sounded a lot tougher than its real name". His mother had a television, which was a rare and new technology at the time, and Carlin became a fan of the late-night talk show ''Broadway Open House'' during its short run. Carlin joined the U.S. Air Force and trained as a radar technician. During his time in the Air force, he had been court-martialed three times and received many nonjudicial punishments and reprimands. ==Career== The first of Carlin's 14 stand-up comedy specials for HBO was filmed in 1977. From the late 1980s, his performances were focused on sociocultural criticism of American society. Carlin acted in movies including ''Jersey Girl'', ''Dogma (movie)'', ''Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure'' (and its sequel), ''Scary Movie 3'', and Walt Disney Pictures's ''Tarzan 2''. He also narrated the children's television series ''Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends'' from 1984 to 1995 (Actor Alec Baldwin later took over the role in 1998), and Portrayed Mr. Conductor on ''Shining Time Station''. He was known for his "seven dirty words" routine. The routine was about seven words people should not say in the Mass media. (The list was ironically used by many radio stations, as a guide to what kind of language was not allowed.) Comedy Central called Carlin one of the greatest stand-up comedians. ==Personal life== Carlin married Brenda Hosbrook on June 3, 1961, together they have a daughter named Kelly. They remained married until her death in 1997, just a few day's before Carlin's 60th birthday. Carlin then married Sally Wade on June 24, 1998, the marriage lasted until Carlin's death in 2008. ==Death== Carlin had a history of heart problems. He had several heart attacks. He died of heart failure in Santa Monica, California at age 71. == Works == === Discography === ;Main * 1963: ''Burns and Carlin at the Playboy Club Tonight'' * 1967: ''Take-Offs and Put-Ons'' * 1972: ''FM & AM'' * 1972: ''Class Clown'' * 1973: ''Occupation: Foole'' * 1974: ''Toledo Window Box'' * 1975: ''An Evening with Wally Londo Featuring Bill Slaszo'' * 1977: ''On the Road (George Carlin album)'' * 1981: ''A Place for My Stuff'' * 1982: ''Carlin at Carnegie'' * 1984: ''Carlin on Campus'' * 1986: ''Playin' with Your Head'' * 1988: ''What Am I Doing in New Jersey?'' * 1990: ''Parental Advisory: Explicit Lyrics'' * 1992: ''Jammin' in New York'' * 1996: ''Back in Town (George Carlin album)'' * 1999: ''You Are All Diseased'' * 2001: ''Complaints and Grievances'' * 2002: ''George Carlin on Comedy'' * 2006: ''Life Is Worth Losing'' * 2008: ''It's Bad for Ya'' ;Compilations * 1978: ''Indecent Exposure (album)'' * 1984: ''The George Carlin Collection'' * 1992: ''Classic Gold (George Carlin album)'' * 1999: ''The Little David Years (1971-1977)'' === Filmography === {|class="wikitable" class="wikitable sortable" style="margin:1em 0;" |- style="background:#b0c4de;" !
