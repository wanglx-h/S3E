The sitcom's main character is a World War II veteran and blue-collar worker Archie Bunker. Archie Bunker is old, a bigotry, and is not very smart. He gets mad at the changes he sees in the world and wants to go back to when life was more easier. Archie does not like the Democratic Party (United States) and is a Republican Party (United States).

Archie and Edith have one child. They have a daughter named Gloria Stivic who is a feminism. Archie calls Gloria "little girl".

Archie and the Jeffersons argue over the color of God's skin because he does not think God is black. But Archie gets drunk and is locked in the basement and he thinks that God came to rescue him but it was just one of the Jeffersons. He is surprised that God is black and bows down to him. In many of the episodes Michael and Archie argue. One time Archie was nearly arrested for owning tear gas and another time he went missing. Archie and the people he works with go on strike action and Archie does not have a job. But Edith gets a job instead because the family needs money. This makes Archie mad because he thinks that the husband should be working. There are also some flashback episodes. The first one is about the first time Archie and Michael meet. It is a very famous episode and Michael got the name "meathead" in it. In the third season the episode,"The Bunkers and the Swingers" won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series.

The story of ''All in the Family'' continued in ''Archie Bunker's Place'' and the house is the main place with a new family named the "Cumberbatches" in the spin-off show ''704 Hauser'' but the show was cancelled less than a month after it started. ==Creating the show== ===The first pilot episode=== File:Jean Stapleton Carroll O'Connor All In the Family.JPG ''All in the Family'' is based on the 1960s British sitcom television program ''Till Death Us Do Part''. Norman Lear said he read about the show in a ''Variety (magazine)'' magazine. He thought the show was like the Interpersonal relationship that he had with his father. Norman Lear bought the rights to use ''Til Death Us Do Part'' and used the ideas of the show in ''All in the Family''. Norman Lear is the creator of ''All in the Family''. He would also add some of the things his father did into the show. CBS wanted to have the show but the show was going to be on American Broadcasting Company. There was two pilot episodes made. One was made on September 3, 1968 and called ''And Justice For All''. The pilot episodes had different actors and actresss for Michael (Tim McIntire) and Gloria Stivic (Kelly Jean Peters) and the house they lived in looked different. Archie and Edith were named "Archie Justice" and "Edith Justice" instead of Archie Bunker and Edith Bunker. Micheal was named “Dickie” for the first pilot. Lionel Jefferson was played by D'Urville Martin instead of Mike Evans (actor). For the start of the episode, Archie and Edith were singing, "Those were the Days" but the song was longer and shots of where they lived were shown but not them. Also Edith played the piano faster in this pilot episode then the rest of the show. The camera showed the door mat which said "Justice" before the episode started. The pilot was tape recorder with three cameras so the people watching could see the characters feelings about things. This would be used for the entire show. Most other sitcoms used one camera but ''All in the Family'' was the first and more sitcoms used three cameras after. The pilot talked about many important issues instead of just one. The characters talked about racism, welfare, antisemitism, and even different types of sausage. The ending credits of the pilot episode is the kitchen room with the party decorations up. Edith and Archie are singing the same song from the beginning as the credits roll. ===The second pilot episode=== ABC did not like the first pilot because they did not think Archie and Edith were good together but ABC gave Lear the money to make a second pilot. The episode was made on February 10, 1969 in Los Angeles and it was called ''Those were the Days''. The second pilot episode was almost the same as the first pilot episode but in this pilot Gloria was played by Candice Azzara and Chip Oliver played Richard. Richard was the name of Michael Stivic's character and was named "Dickie" in the first pilot episode. D'Urville Martin played Lionel Jefferson again. Another difference from the pilot episodes and the rest of the show is that Edith can be rude to Archie at times and calls Archie,"Mr. Religion." For the start of this pilot episode, Edith and Archie are singing "Those were the Days" the same way it would be for the rest of the show. After Edith and Archie start to sing, shots of the neighborhood that they live in are shown but not Manhattan. The ending credits are Archie and Edith singing the same song but they are not shown. Instead the same shots from the opening song is shown but backwards. This was used for the rest of the show. The pilots both had the same story. Gloria and Richard are making a Surprise (emotion) anniversary party for Edith and Archie. Gloria does not want Richard to argue with Archie. Their friend, Lionel Jefferson was fixing the toilet for them. When Richard and Gloria leave Archie and Edith come home, Edith is surprised to see the party. But when Richard and Gloria come back, Richard and Archie start to argue about Controversy ideas. Gloria tells Archie that she is going to leave because they keep arguing but she does not. Lionel comes back to the house and Archie tries to show Richard that he likes African-Americans but insults Jewish people instead. Lionel and Richard play a joke on Archie and try to make him think that he is Jewish. Edith opens a present from Archie but he did not make it. She is very happy but Archie is confused. The episodes end with Archie insulting Richard. ===Making the rest of the show=== File:Carroll O'Connor Jean Stapleton Archie and Edith Bunker 1974.JPG This was the last pilot and it would be two years until the first episode of the ''All in the Family'' was made. Both of the pilot episodes were never put on television. ABC did not like the show because they thought it was too controversial and because another show, ''Turn-On'' was ended after one episode. They also thought that the people who watch ABC would not like Archie Bunker. Norman Lear and Bud Yorkin took back the screenplay and thought about making a movie with ''All in the Family'' and not a show because Norman and Bud has made good movies. Norman Lear had a meeting with United Artists about making movies and Bud had a meeting with CBS. CBS thought about getting ''All in the Family'' back. Norman Lear and Bud Yorkin agreement to make 13 episodes for the first season and CBS bought the show back. The show was filmed at Television City in Hollywood from 1971 to 1975 and then was filmed at Metromedia Square also in Hollywood, from 1975 to 1979. Tandem Productions was the company that produced the show. Norman Lear and Bud Yorkin creating the company. Norman Lear wanted the show to be made in black and white but CBS would not let him. The furniture in the show did not have many colors in them this was because Norman Lear wanted the people watching the show to make it feel like they were looking at family photos. ''All in the Family'' was the first American sitcom to be recorded in front of a live audience. Each episode is 25 or 26 minutes long. CBS had a warning before each episode to warn the people watching that controversial topics would be talked about on the show, but they did it to make people laugh. CBS did this so people would know before the show started if they were going to be offended by what was on the show. Rob Reiner and Sally Struthers played Michael and Gloria instead and the first episode was put on television on January 12, 1971. ''All in the Family'' was not famous in the first season. But the show started to become famous when CBS had reruns of the first season on television. ===Setting and location=== File:Archie Bunker House 01.JPG ''All in the Family'' takes place in Astoria, Queens which is a neighbourhood in Queens, New York.

''All in the Family'' became very famous because it talked about controversial topics like race and sexuality but in a funny way. Many people liked the show because they thought the show was relatable for them because the show was about average people in the 1970s. Norman Lear used this when he made other shows like ''Sanford and Son''. ''All in the Family'' won many awards for it's success.

''All in the Family'' has the most spin-offs of any television show ever. There are even spin-offs of the spin-off shows. ''Maude'', ''The Jeffersons'', ''Good Times'', and ''Archie Bunker's Place'' were successful sitcoms and Norman Lear and CBS decided to make more. But ''Gloria'', ''Checking In'', and ''704 Hauser'' were not successful and were cancelled. * ''Maude (TV series)'' was the first spin-off of ''All in the Family''. It started in 1972 and is about Edith Bunker's liberalism cousin, Maude Findlay after she moved to Upstate New York. The show deals with many controversial issues like ''All in the Family''. **''Good Times'' is a spin-off of ''Maude''. The actress Esther Rolle played Florida Evans in both television shows. The show is about an African American family in the Chicago housing project. The show became very famous. Some people think that ''Good Times'' is not a spin-off because the show changes the name of Florida Evans's husband and Maude's name is not said in the show. * ''The Jeffersons'' is a spin-off of ''All in the Family'' and even had more seasons then ''All in Family''. It is the longest lasting spin-off of ''All in the Family''. The show is about Archie Bunker's old neighbours, The Jeffersons moving out to a new home in the East Side of New York City. **''Checking In'' is a spin-off of ''The Jeffersons''. It is about the maid in ''The Jeffersons'' getting a new job at a hotel. Not many people liked the show. The show only had four episodes and in ''The Jeffersons'' it is said that the hotel where the maid worked at and where the show took place burned down so she came back. * ''Archie Bunker's Place'' is a spin-off of ''All in the Family'' and is about Archie Bunker after the end of ''All in the Family''. Archie owns a Bar (business) in Queens. Stephanie Mills who was in the last season of ''All in the Family'' is in this show. The last time Michael is seen is on the show. During the show Archie's wife, Edith dies of a stroke because Jean Stapleton who plays Edith did not want to play Edith anymore. **''Gloria (TV series)'' is a spin-off of ''All in the Family'' and is about Gloria Stivic raising her son after her husband, Michael left her. The show had one season. Archie was going to be in the show but it did not happen. An episode of ''Archie Bunker's Place'' was used to start this show. *''704 Hauser'' is a spin-off of ''All in the Family'' and is about a new family living in the house the Bunker's used to live in almost 20 years later. Unlike in ''All in the Family'' where the parents are conservatives in the United States and the children are liberals, in ''704 Hauser'' the son is conservative and his parents are liberals. John Amos the actor from ''Good Times'' is in the show. Joey Stivic (son of Michael and Gloria Stivic) is in the show. The show was cancelled less than a month after it started. This is the last spin-off and last time the fictional universe of ''All in the Family'' and it's spin-offs are seen. ===2019 television special=== On May 22, 2019 ABC aired a television program special.
