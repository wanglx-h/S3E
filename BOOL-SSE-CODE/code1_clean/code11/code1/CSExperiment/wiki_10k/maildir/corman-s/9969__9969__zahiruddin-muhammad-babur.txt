He was the eldest son of Umar Sheikh Mirza, governor of Uzbekistan.He fought and won in the first battle of Panipat. == Plans of the establishment of Mughal empire == File:Babur_idealisiert.jpg 1589-90]] In 1525 Babur set out to attack India. He had only about twelve thousand men with him but he had been promised help by Daulat Khan Lodi, the governor of Punjab region. They planned to march together against the ruling Sultan Ibrahim Lodi, who was the King of Delhi at that time. When Babur reached India, the government was afraid to help him, and eventually backed out, and so Babur started off to Delhi by himself with his small army of men. Ibrahim Lodi was reported to have one hundred thousand men and one hundred elephants. But Babur had something which Ibrahim did not have – heavy guns and cannons, the first proper Turkic peoples style artillery seen in medieval India. There were hardly any guns at that time in India and Babur had managed to get hold of some in Kabul. He had cannons and some firearms as well. He met Ibrahim Lodi and his army at Panipat in modern Haryana. The two armies met at the famous First battle of Panipat, at a small village near Delhi. Both armies remained in position opposite each other for a week before the battle began. Babur was an excellent General officer and he planned the battle very carefully as conquering Delhi was indeed very important to him. After the battle about fifteen thousand men of the enemy were killed including their commander Ibrahim Lodi. Before the enemy could recover from their defeat, Delhi was captured. == Consolidating victory == Babur had to fight more major battles, the battles of Khanua and Gogra. In 1527 A.D. he had to face a fierce enemy of his at Khanua, the Rajput hero, Rana Sangram (or Sanga)of Mewar. A ferocious battle was fought between the two in the field of Khanua and Babur won the battle. In 1529 A.D., Babur got into a battle with the Afghan. Babur won, but the Afghans were not totally weakened. They joined hands with Mahmud Lodi, the brother of Ibrahim Lodi, to fight Babur again. But Babur approached forward and was a successful winner of this Battle in Gogra. == Related pages == * Mughal Empire ==References== Category:Mughal emperors Category:1483 births Category:1530 deaths Category:16th century in India
