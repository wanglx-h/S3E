File:Denmark location sjalland.svg '''Zealand''' (Danish language: ''Sjælland'') is an island in the eastern part of Denmark. It is just west of Sweden and a strait called the Øresund lies between the two. It has an area of 7,031 km² and is the largest island in the country. About 2,268,000 people were living in Zealand as of 2016. Most of these people live in and around Copenhagen, the Capital city of Denmark, which is on the eastern shore of Zealand. A number of Bridge and Tunnel link Zealand to other parts of Denmark. They include: * the Great Belt Bridge, which links Zealand to Funen, an island to the west. * the Storstrøm Bridge, which links Zealand to Lolland, an island to the south. * the Øresund Bridge, which links Zealand (actually the island of Amager) to Sweden to the east, near Malmö.
