File:Chest.agr.jpg The '''chest''' is the front part of the torso. It is between the neck and abdomen. In mammals, the parts that make up the thorax are the sternum, the thoracic vertebrae and the ribs. It starts from the neck and stops at the diaphragm. Women develop breasts on the chest during puberty, while male chests generally remain flat, while gaining muscle and many men grow chest hair. However, excess fat in men can contribute to gynocomestia, which leads to breast development in men. In insects and crustaceans, it is the middle of the three main body sections. The walking legs are usually on the thorax. Category:Torso
