File:Palmyra Atoll.svg of Palmyra Atoll]] '''Palmyra Atoll''' is an island in the North Pacific Ocean. No one lives there, but 4 to 20 people use this island, mainly scientists. It is managed as a nature reserve by the United States. It is known as the ''Palmyra Atoll National Wildlife Refuge''.[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/um.html "Palmyra Atoll" at ''CIA World Factbook''] ; excerpt, "no indigenous inhabitants"; retrieved 2013-4-19. In 2005, a team of scientists from around the world started to build a research station on the island. They wanted to gain a deeper understanding of the environment of the island. == History == Palmyra Atoll was claimed by the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1862, and was taken by the United States in 1898 along with Hawaii. The atoll was not included in the Hawaii Admission Act of 1959, which made Hawaii a state, so it remained a US territory. ==References== *https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/um.html ==Other websites== *[http://shadow.eas.gatech.edu/~kcobb/palmyra.html Palmyra atoll] *[http://www.janeresture.com/palmyra/index.htm Palmyra Island] *[http://www.fws.gov/palmyraatoll/ Palmyra Atoll NWR] *[http://www.strangemag.com/palmyra.html The Curse of Palmyra Island – article] *[http://labyrinth13.com/Book_Details_COPI.htm The Curse of Palmyra Island – free book] *[http://nature.org/wherewework/asiapacific/palmyra/ The Nature Conservancy in Palmyra Atoll] *[http://www.palmyraresearch.org/ Palmyra Atoll Research Consortium] *[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&vol=331&invol=256 ''United States v.
