File:Light switch inside explained.jpg A '''switch''' is something that changes the flux of an electrical circuit. The most common kind of '''switch''' is something (for example a railroad switch) which can be taken off of one course and put onto another. The term "switch" usually means electricity power. In applications where more than one switch is needed, (i.e. a telephone service) mechanical switches have been replaced by electronic switches which can be controlled automatically. The switch is called a "logic gate" when used in a mathematics form. In logic, arguments are represented as logic gates. The use of electronic ''gates'' to work as a system of logical gates is the basic idea behind the computer —i.e. a computer is a lot of electronic switches that work as logic gates. == Types of switch == There are many types of switches. Some of these are: *DIP switch *Reed switch *Rocker switch *Micro switch *Relay switch *Rotary switch *Surface mount switch *Toggle switch *Tilt switch *Time switch == Other meanings == File:Swe subway switch 20050425 001.jpg)]] The word 'switch' can also mean to change between two things. For example, on a railway line, sometimes the track can split into two different tracks. If the train is travelling on one line and changes over to the other, it has just done a switch. ==Related pages== *Electricity *Railway Category:Electronic components category:Electronic switches
