Subject: Premature ejaculation
'''Premature ejaculation''' (also known as '''PE''') is a disease affecting many men. It is when during sexual intercourse (sex) the male cannot stop himself from ejaculation after starting sex. The usual time from starting sex until ejaculation is about 4 to 8 minutes.Strassberg, D. S., & Perelman, M. A. (2009). Sexual dysfunctions. In P. H. Blaney & T. Millon (Eds.), ''Oxford textbook of psychopathology'' (2nd ed.), (pp. 399–430). NY: Oxford University Press. == Treatment exercises == The condition is usually curable, or at least treatable with exercises. (There are more exercises than these, however, these are the most common.) === Stimulation treatment === One exercise is to create an erection and begin to lose it, then stimulate it again. This exercise is best done alone at first and then with a partner. Thrusting should not be used with a partner until very near the end of treatment. This treatment may take several weeks to fully cure the problem if it is used properly. === Muscular treatment === Another treatment involves using the muscle which stops urine. To locate the muscle, simply begin urinate and stop quickly before emptying the bladder. Doing that will demonstrate how to use the muscle. Then whenever convenient use the muscle. You do not need to be urinating to use the muscle and it is suggested you are not. After a few weeks of both these treatments, the PE will become more like traditional ejaculation and after about one and a half to two and a half months, it should be absolutely normal. ===Notes=== Category:Sexual disorders
