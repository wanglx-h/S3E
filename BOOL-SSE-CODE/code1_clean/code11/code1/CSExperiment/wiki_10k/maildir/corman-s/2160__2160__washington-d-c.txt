(also known as simply '''Washington''' or '''D.C.''', and officially as the '''District of Columbia''') is the capital of the United States. It is a federal district. The President of the United States, the United States Congress, the United States Supreme Court and many major national government offices are in the territory. This makes it the political center of the United States of America. Washington was named after the first U.S. President George Washington. "D.C." stands for "District of Columbia". At first, it was made up of a piece from Virginia south of the Potomac River and a piece from Maryland north of the Potomac River. In 1847, Virginia's piece was returned to it, and is now Arlington, Virginia and part of the city of Alexandria, Virginia. Since 1847, all of the District of Columbia is on the north side of the Potomac River. The District of Columbia used to have other small towns which used "D.C.". Since 1800, the District of Columbia has been the home of all three branches of the U.S. government: United States Congress, the President, and the United States Supreme Court. All of the major Political parties in the United States are based here. It is also the headquarters of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the Organization of American States (OAS). Because it is the home of the President and is important to American politics, many groups often hold large demonstrations and protests here. These are often at the National Mall, a large open park which has many monuments and museums. The District of Columbia’s many museums and monuments make it a popular place for tourists to visit. In 2020, the U.S. Census Bureau said that 689,545 people lived within the District of Columbia. == History == When English people first came to the area, there was a Native American village on the spot called ''Nakochtank''. This name survives in the name of the Anacostia River. This river was known for the healing properties of its pure water and it is recorded that the Emperor Powhatan, who lived in what is now Richmond, Virginia, made the trip all the way to Nakochtank once for this reason. The 1789 United States Constitution said that a capital city would be created in a district, but did not say where it should be. James Madison and others thought it should be far away from other states and cities. This way, it would be independent and not controlled by any state. In 1790, a wikt:compromise was reached and capital was placed between Virginia and Maryland. It was a square, ten miles (16km) long on each side, and split by the Potomac River, which separated the two states. Half of the district was in Maryland and the other half was in Virginia, and the two states gave this land to the government. In 1791, it was named ''Washington, the District of Columbia'' to honor George Washington. ''Columbia'' was another name for North America. During the War of 1812, the British burned down many government buildings, including the White House. == City design == File:L'Enfant plan.svg Washington, D.C. was planned before it was built. Pierre L'Enfant drew a plan for the city that said where all the streets, parks, and important buildings would be. Unlike most cities in the United States, D.C. has many roundabouts or traffic circles. The city was supposed to have long and wide avenues, and many open spaces for monuments and parks. The National Mall is an example of this. == Representation == === Local Government === Washington, D.C. is not a state. Its citizens have less control over their city than most Americans, but D.C. has had an Election mayor and a city council since 1973. But Congress can make it so that a local law doesn't happen. The current mayor of Washington, D.C. is Muriel Bowser, a Democratic Party (United States). === In Congress === The license plates on the cars in Washington, D.C. say, "Taxation Without Representation." This is a protest from people who live in Washington, D.C. about having to pay taxes to the United States without having a vote in the United States House of Representatives. It resembles the protest made by colonists before the American Revolution about having to pay taxes to Great Britain. Some people are against letting Washington, D.C. have a Congressman or Congresswoman because the Constitution only allows states to have Congressmen or Congresswomen. == Culture == === Performing arts and music === File:Kennedy Center at Sunset.jpg is along the Potomac River.]] Washington, D.C. is the center of the nation for its arts. The National Symphony Orchestra, the Washington National Opera, and the Washington Ballet are all inside the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. The Kennedy Center Honors are given every year to the people who have greatly helped the cultural life of the United States. The President and First Lady of the United States usually go to the Honors ceremony. === Museums === There are also many museums and memorials in Washington, D.C.. The Smithsonian Institution runs many museums. == Geography == === Climate === Washington D.C. has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification: ''Cfa''). Summers are hot and humid, winters are cool to cold, and Spring (season) and autumn are mild. The average yearly precipitation is fairly high at , and is regular throughout the year. Snow falls a few times each winter, and sometimes in spring and fall, which is usually light and lasts no longer than a few days. Blizzards do occur, but not every winter. The city gets many summer heat waves that can last for many days, and less commonly winter cold waves that usually last for a few days. |collapsed = Y |single line = Y |Jan record high F = 79 |Feb

However, 37% of Washington-area commuters take public transportation to work, the second-highest rate in the country. An additional 12% of D.C. commuters walked to work, 6% carpooled, and 3% traveled by bicycle in 2010. Washington has very few freeways. The funds that had been dedicated for freeway construction were instead redirected to the region's public transportation infrastructure. The interstate highways that do continue into Washington, including Interstate 66 and Interstate 395 (District of Columbia – Virginia), both terminate shortly upon entering the city. The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) operates the Washington Metro, the city's rapid transit system, as well as Metrobus (Washington, D.C.). Both systems serve the District and its suburbs. Metro opened on March 27, 1976 and presently consists of 86stations and of track. With an average of about one million trips each weekday, Metro is the second-busiest rapid transit system in the country, after the New York City Subway. Metrobus serves over 400,000 riders each weekday, making it the nation's sixth-largest bus system. The city also operates its own DC Circulator bus system, which connects commercial areas within central Washington. File:Union Station and Christopher Columbus Memorial Fountain.jpg is a transportation hub for passengers on Amtrak, commuter rail lines, and the Washington Metro.]] Union Station (Washington, D.C.) is the main train station in Washington, D.C., and handles about 70,000 people each day. It is Amtrak's second-busiest station with 4.6 million passengers annually and serves as the southern terminus for the Northeast Corridor and Acela Express routes. Maryland's MARC Train and Virginia's Virginia Railway Express commuter trains and the Metrorail Red Line (Washington Metro) also provide service into Union Station. Expansion plans announced in 2011 will make Union Station the city's primary intercity bus transit center. A new streetcar system opened in 2016. Three major airports serve The District. The Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport is across from downtown Washington in Arlington, Virginia and has its own Metrorail station. Major international flights arrive and depart from Washington Dulles International Airport, west of the District in Fairfax County, Virginia and Loudoun County, Virginia counties in Virginia. Dulles gained its own Metrorail station in 2016. Baltimore/Washington International Airport is northeast of the District in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. == References == == Other websites == * * [https://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/states/dc/home.html Guide to Washington, D.C.], materials from the Library of Congress Category:Washington, D.C.
