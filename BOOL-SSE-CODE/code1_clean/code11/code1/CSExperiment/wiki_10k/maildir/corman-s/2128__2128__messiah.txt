Subject: Messiah
The '''Messiah''' or '''Anointed One''' is the figure who God promised to the Judaism in order to salvation, according to Judeo-Christian beliefs. Sometimes real or Fiction people are called ''messianic'' if they have the quality of a messiah, or if people think they will bring about a better world. ==Biblical views== Jews believe god inspired biblical prophets to tell people that he was coming. The idea of the messiah became very important in Jewish teaching and thought during Ancient Rome rule in the 1st century BC. According to the scriptures, the messiah would rescue people from the Romans and restore the country. There are many views about how the messiah will come: as a judge, warrior, beggar, academic, philosopher, healing, or a common person. === Jesus as the Messiah === Christianity, which began in Israel with Jewish followers of Jesus (), says that the Messiah foretold by the Jewish Scriptures is Jesus. Christians believe that, fulfilling a prophecy, Jesus died for the Sin of the world, Resurrection of Jesus and remains seated at God's right hand until his return. Most Jews do not hold these beliefs; those who do are sometimes called Messianic Jews. According to some Messianic Jews and other Christians, most Jews' denial that Jesus was the Messiah is, itself, the fulfillment of prophecy. (see Epistle to the Romans chapter 10) Muslims believe that Jesus was the son of Mary (mother of Jesus), a mighty prophet of God, the Messiah. (However, in Islam, the Messiah has a different role than he does in Christianity or Judaism.) Muslims believe that Jesus will someday return in his Second Coming to fight besides the Mahdi against the ''Dajjal'' ("false messiah"). ==References== Category:Christology Category:Islamic theology Category:Judaism Category:Jesus
