'''Customer service''' is doing things to satisfy a purchaser's needs. This may be before, during, or after the purchase. A major part of customer service is helping if merchandise is broken or not working properly. These situations are usually covered by a customer service policy. Many stores will have a special desk or area where people can take their complaints. One purpose is to persuade the customer to buy other things later. ==Related pages== * Sales Category:Commerce
