File:Wiki-analsex.png File:Wiki-anal missionary.png '''Anal sex''' is a sexual intercourse performed on the anus. Anal sex can involve a Human penis inserted in the anus, anilingus, of the anus, using fingers for penetration and using different objects for stimulation. == Overview == The anus is a part of the body that is tight and cannot lubricate itself. Because of this, a person should be careful not to damage the walls of this organ if inserting something. Lubrication is often used which can be oil or water-based and is sold commercially. For a man, pleasure can come from the stimulation of the prostate that is found near the anus. For women, it can come from indirect stimulation of the Clitoris/G-Spot or the cervix. Both men and women can get pleasure from anal sex because the anus has many nerve endings. ==References== Category:Sexual acts
