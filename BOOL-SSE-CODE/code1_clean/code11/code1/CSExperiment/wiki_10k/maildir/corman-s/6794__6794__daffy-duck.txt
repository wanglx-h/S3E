He stands on two legs, has a black body, a white ring about his neck, and a yellowish-orange beak. He first appeared in ''Porky´s Duck Hunt'' in 1937. He was created by Tex Avery and Bob Clampett. In 1946, Daffy had started to change, and Daffy became less looney. Over the years, Daffy Duck had changed from a screwball and heckling character to greedy and a jealous character. ==Appearances== * ''Space Jam'' (1996) -- (Main role) * ''Looney Tunes: Back in Action'' (2003) -- (Main role) * ''Space Jam: A New Legacy'' (2021) -- (Main role) Category:Animated characters Category:Anthromophic characters Category:Comics characters Category:Fictional characters introduced in the 1930s Category:Fictional ducks Category:Looney Tunes characters Category:Fictional characters introduced in 1937
