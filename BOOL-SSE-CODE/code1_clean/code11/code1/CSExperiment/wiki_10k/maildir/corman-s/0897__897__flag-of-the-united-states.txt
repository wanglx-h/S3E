File:Flag of the United States.svg The '''flag of the United States''' is a national flag. It has 7 red stripes and 6 white stripes. These 13 stripes represent the original thirteen colonies. The flag also has a blue ''canton'', a rectangle in the top left corner. There are 50 stars which represent the 50 U.S. state of America. When a new state joins the United States, a new flag is made with an extra star. The new flag is first flown on the 4th of July (Independence Day (US)). The last states to join the United States were Alaska and Hawaii in 1959. Alaska joined on 3 January 1959, so the new flag with 49 stars was used from 4 July 1959. Hawaii joined on 21 August 1959, so the flag with 50 stars that is used today was not flown until 4 July 1960. The colors in the flag are red, white and blue. The colors have no special meaning in the flag, but in the Coat of arms of the United States, white stands for purity and innocence, red for bravery and strength, and blue for watchfulness, perseverance and justice. The flag is also often called the '''Stars and Stripes''', the '''Star-Spangled Banner''', or '''Old Glory'''. The Star-Spangled Banner of the United States is a reference to the flag. == Evolution of the United States' flag == Since 1818, a star for each new state has been added to the flag on the Fourth of July immediately following each state's admission. In years in which multiple states have been admitted, the number of stars on the flag has jumped correspondingly. The greatest example so far was in 1890, when five states were admitted within the span of a single year (North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, and Washington (U.S. state) in November 1889 and Idaho on 3 July 1890). This change has typically been the only change made with each revision of the flag since 1777, with the exception of changes in 1795 and 1818, which increased the number of stripes to 15 and then returned it to 13, respectively. As the exact pattern of stars was not specified prior to 1912, and the exact colors not specified prior to 1934, many of the historical U.S. national flags (shown below) have had varied designs. 1775–1777 (the "Grand Union Flag") |US flag 13 stars.svg| 1777–1795 |Star-Spangled Banner flag.svg| 1795–1818 (the "Star-Spangled Banner (flag)") |US flag 20 stars.svg| 1818–1819 |US flag 21 stars.svg| 1819–1820 |US flag 23 stars.svg| 1820–1822 |US flag 24 stars.svg| 1822–1836 |US flag 25 stars.svg| 1836–1837 |US flag 26 stars.svg| 1837–1845 |US flag 27 stars.svg| 1845–1846 |US flag 28 stars.svg| 1846–1847 |US flag 29 stars.svg| 1847–1848 |US flag 30 stars.svg| 1848–1851 |US flag 31 stars.svg| 1851–1858 |US flag 32 stars.svg| 1858–1859 |US flag 33 stars.svg| 1859–1861 |US flag 34 stars.svg| 1861–1863 |US flag 35 stars.svg| 1863–1865 |US flag 36 stars.svg| 1865–1867 |US flag 37 stars.svg| 1867–1877 |US flag 38 stars.svg| 1877–1890 |US flag 43 stars.svg| 1890–1891 |US flag 44 stars.svg| 1891–1896 |US flag 45 stars.svg| 1896–1908 |US flag 46 stars.svg| 1908–1912 |US flag 48 stars.svg| 1912–1959 |US flag 49 stars.svg| 1959–1960 |Flag of the United States (Pantone).svg| 1960–present }} ==International and space transportation of (woven) flags== One flag was transported to the lunar surface during the first manned flight to the moon. On 30 April 1975 the last group of (eleven) US soldiers leaving the Vietnam War did grab the US flag [of their USMC Marine Embassy Guard ] from the outpost on the embassy roof, before all were lifted off the roof and flown out of the country by a helicopter of the Marine Corps.Hirsch, Sarah.
