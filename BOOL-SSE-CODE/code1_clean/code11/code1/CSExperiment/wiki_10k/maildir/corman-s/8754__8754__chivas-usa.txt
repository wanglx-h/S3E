'''Club Deportivo Chivas USA''' is an United States football (soccer) team that played in Major League Soccer (MLS) in Carson, California. They began play in 2005, and played at the home of the Los Angeles Galaxy. When the team was formed, it was planned to be a "''little brother''" to the very popular Mexico team C.D. Guadalajara. "''Chivas"'', the Spanish language word for "''goats''", is the nickname of C.D. Guadalajara. The team was originally owned by two Mexican businessmen, one of whom also owned C.D. Guadalajara. Due to falling attendance and ownership failures, MLS bought the team back in February 2014, with plans to sell it to new owners who would give the team a new name. In September 2014, the team was sold to a new group. As part of the sale, Chivas USA was dissolved at the end of the 2014 season. A new team, Los Angeles FC, started play in 2017 replacing the old Chivas USA. The assets of the team were purchased by Wrexham A.F.C. in 2023 as co-owner Ryan Reynolds announced plans to re-start the team as an American "feeder club" for Wrexham. Due to the relatively recent time in which this news was announced, there are not many more details known about the takeover.
