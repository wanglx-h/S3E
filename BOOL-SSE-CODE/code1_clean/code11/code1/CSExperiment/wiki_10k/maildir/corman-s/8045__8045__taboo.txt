File:Tabu in Bora Bora.jpg. Translates to "Keep out"]] In a group or society, a '''taboo''' is something that is not acceptable to talk about or do. An activity or behavior can be taboo in one culture, but not in another. Some things like cannibalism and incest are taboo in almost all societies. Sometimes even talking about taboos is taboo. Some taboos may also be crime, and people who break them may be punished. Breaking taboos can seem rude, and can cause wikt:embarrassment or shame. == Origins of the word == The English word “taboo” comes from the Tongan language word ''Tapu (Polynesian culture)'' or the Fijian word ''tabu''. These words usually mean "not allowed", or "forbidden". In its current use in Tonga, the word ''tapu'' also translates to "sacred" or "holy", this means something that is protected by custom or by law. For example, the main island in the Kingdom of Tonga, where the capital Nuku'alofa is located and most of the population resides, is called "Tongatapu". Its first recorded use in English dates back to 1777. An English people explorer, James Cook, went to a place he named "the Friendly Islands" (now Tonga). Writing about the Tongans, he wrote: Some Solomon Islands say that their languages have a word ''tabu'' (said like "ta-boo") that means “holy.” This word refers to places in the bush where holy spirits live. Local customs say that nobody should disturb these places unless a ceremony or ritual is taking place. As taboo, they are places that should not be touched. == Common taboos == Many world religions have taboos about food. Islam and Judaism both say there are some foods which people should never eat. A halal diet does not include any of the foods that are taboo in Islam. A kosher diet does not include any of the foods that are taboo in Judaism. Other religions say that people should be vegetarianism. In these religions, eating meat is taboo. Many societies also have taboos about food. For example, cannibalism is taboo in most societies in the world. Some sexual intercourse, gender roles, and Intimate relationships are taboo in many religions, societies, and Culture. For example, fornication, adultery, endogamy violations, miscegenation, homosexuality, incest, bestiality, pedophilia, necrophilia and paraphilias are taboo in many groups. In many societies, performing bodily functions in public is taboo. Taboo activities in public might include burping, flatulence, defecation, urination, masturbation, nosepicking, and spitting. In some societies, menstruation is taboo, and women are expected not to talk about it in public. Some religions say that certain types of genitalia are taboo. For example, Judaism says that boys should be circumcision. In some societies, having Sexual reassignment surgery is taboo. Pornography, nudity, drug addiction, alcoholism, slavery, and vulgarity are taboo in many societies. Some cultures see certain Gesture as taboo. In some groups and societies, talking about race or racism is taboo. == Origin == There are two major Theory about why taboos exist. The '’Anthropology approach’’ says that taboos are the result of history and culture. The ‘’Psychoanalysis approach’’ says there are psychology reasons for why taboos exist. === Anthropological approach === The anthropological approach says that taboos are the result of history and certain culture experiences. Steven Pinker, A psychologist and writer, says that taboos have developed culturally from more basic instincts.Probable source: Pinker S. 1994. ''The language instinct''. New York: HarperCollings. He thinks that humans have a reflex to feel disgust when they see some things that carry disease (including dead bodies). He says that people created taboos regarding the dead because of this natural disgust for dead bodies. He thinks that some actions can also cause this reflex of disgust. He says many people have a reflex of disgust about incest (sexual relationships between family members). For this reason, taboos about incest developed. === Psychoanalytical approach === The psychoanalytical approach says that taboos exist because of people’s Unconscious mind. For example, Sigmund Freud thought that children naturally have sexual desires towards family members. In his book ‘’Totem and Taboo,’’ Freud wrote that taboos about incest developed to make sure people would not act on these sexual desires. Freud thought that incest and patricide are the only “universal” taboos (meaning these behaviors are taboo in almost all societies and cultures). He said that these taboos formed the basis of modern societies. German psychologist Wilhelm Wundt explains that taboos come from people’s fear of a "demonic" power. When people think this demonic power lies hidden in an object, that object becomes taboo. Sigmund Freud disagreed. Freud thought that Wundt’s ideas did not consider the psychological reasons for taboos. Writing about the history of taboos, Freud said: :"Taboos, we must suppose, are prohibitions of primæval Ancient history which were at some time externally imposed upon a generation of primitive men; they must, that is to say, no doubt have been impressed on them violently by the previous generation. These prohibitions must have concerned activities towards which there was a strong inclination. They must then have persisted from generation to generation, perhaps merely as a result of tradition transmitted through parental and social authority." Freud added: "Anyone who has violated a taboo becomes taboo himself because he possesses the dangerous quality of tempting others to follow his example." ==Related pages== * Censorship * Etiquette or manners * Morality and ethics * Paraphilia * Prejudice * Shunning * Sin * Social stigma * Taboo food and drink * ''Totem and taboo'' == References == == Sources == * * ''Globus'', '''59''': [181ff.] * [562ff.] * * * * [1st ed., 1913.] * * Don Kulick and Margaret Wilson (disambiguation), ''Taboo: Sex, Identity, and Erotic Subjectivity in Anthropological Fieldwork'' 1995 * * * == Other websites == * [http://samvak.tripod.com/taboo.html Review of taboos around the world and their history] * [http://www.tolerance.org/teach/activities/activity.jsp?ar=761 Tolerance.org- December 2006 Controversial subjects in the classroom] * [http://www.buddhistsagainstreincarnation.com Buddhists Against Reincarnation] * [http://www.aolsportsblog.com/2007/01/23/sean-salisbury-might-have-said-something-he-shouldnt-have/#comments Did Sean Salisbury said "Jew" or "chew"?
