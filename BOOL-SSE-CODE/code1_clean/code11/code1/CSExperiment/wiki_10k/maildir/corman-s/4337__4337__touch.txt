There is a special area in the brain used to processing input of touch. It is in the parietal lobe of the cerebral cortex. An animal knows if something is against a part of its body. This is called the sense of touch. The process of touching something may be called feeling.Although 'feeling' has other meanings as well: ''I am feeling ill''. Tiny touch sense organs under the skin help animals feel hardness, softness, and sharpness, for example. Animals also have sense organs which feel temperature and pain. Some parts of the body, such as fingertips have many more sense organs than others. When animals touch things, nerve fibres attached to the sense organ sends messages to the brain through the central nervous system. The brain wikt:interpret the messages, and animals feel things. == Touch as communication == Humans, and mammals in general, often touch each other. Touch is a kind of Nonverbal communication#Touch.
