Its capital (city) is Lincoln, Nebraska and the largest city is Omaha, Nebraska. It touches the states of Wyoming, South Dakota, Iowa, Missouri, Colorado and Kansas. Nebraska is known for its agriculture, especially beef and corn. Nebraska has hot summers and cold winters. A temperature of 30°C (which is about 86°F) is common in the summer, and in the winter it can be -20°C (which is about -4°F) or colder at night. ==History== Native American tribes, including the Omaha, Oto, Missouri, Pawnee, Arapaho and Cheyenne, all ceded land in Nebraska to the U.S. government. On May 30, 1854, the United States government made a law called the Kansas-Nebraska Act. It made two territories called Kansas Territory and Nebraska Territory. In the 1860s, many people moved there to take free land from the government. Nebraska became a state on March 1, 1867. ==Related pages== * Colleges and universities in Nebraska * List of counties in Nebraska ==References== Category:Nebraska Category:1867 establishments in the United States
