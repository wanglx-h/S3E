| related_groups = | footnotes = }} '''Native Americans''' (also called '''Aboriginal Americans''', '''American Indians''', '''Amerindians''', or '''Indigenous peoples of the Americas''') are the indigenous peoples and their descendants, who were in the Americas before the Europe arrived. ==Name== The people are sometimes called '''Indians''', but that may be confusing, because it is the same word used for people from India. When Christopher Columbus explored the area, he did not know about the Americas. He was in the Caribbean but thought he was in the East Indies and so he called the people Indians. Today, some think that it is racism to use Indian for a Native American. There are different Native American Tribe, with many different Language. Some tribes were Hunter-gatherer who moved from place to place. Others lived in one place and built City and Kingdom. Many Native Americans died after the European Settler came to the Americas. One reason is that Disease came with the Europeans but were new to the Native Americans. There were also Battle with the Europe. Many native people were hurt, killed, or forced to leave their homes by settlers, who took their lands. ==Origins== The ancestors of Native Americans came to the Americas from Asia. Some of them may have come to the Americas 15,000 years ago, when Alaska was connected to Siberia by the Bering land bridge. The earliest people in the Americas came from Siberia when there was an ice bridge across the Bering Strait. The cold but mainly grassy plain, called Beringia, was a land bridge that connected Siberia with Canada. It is believed that a few thousand people arrived in Beringia from eastern Siberia during the Last Glacial Maximum and that they moved into the Americas sometime after 16,500 years before the present (BP). That would have occurred as the American Glacier blocking the way southward melted but before the land bridge was covered by the sea about 11,000 years BP. Before the European colonization of the Americas and Russian expansion to the Russian Far East, Beringia was inhabited by the Yupik peoples on both sides of the straits. The culture remains in the region today, with others. In 2012, the governments of Russia and the United States announced a plan to formally establish "a transboundary area of shared Beringian heritage." Among other things, the agreement would establish close ties between the Bering Land Bridge National Preserve and the Cape Krusenstern National Monument in the United States, and Beringia National Park in Russia. Native Americans were divided into many small nations that are called called First Nations in Canada and tribe in the United States. ==Culture== The Native American tribes have their own cultures, which can be grouped together by region. For example, the tribes living in Mesoamerica have similar cultures. ===Food=== Native Americans ate various food depending on where they lived. Native Americans from Mesoamerica introduced vanilla, Avocado and chocolate to the world. ===Religion=== Before Europeans came, the Native Americans practiced many different Religion. Each tribe had its own different beliefs. Many Native Americans now practice Christianity, a religion that was brought to the Americas by Europeans. Others, meanwhile, still practice their own religions. ===Languages=== Native Americans speak over 1000 different languages. Some of these languages had writing systems before Europeans came. Many of these languages are Endangered language because more people speak European languages and do not teach their children Native American languages. ===Music=== Native Americans make musical instruments using the things around them. ===Art=== Native Americans made many different kinds of art. ==Today== ===North America=== There are now more than three million Native Americans in Canada and the United States combined. About 51 million more Native Americans live in Latin America.
