In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade. The first reports say the President was seriously wounded, that he slumped over in Mrs. Kennedy's lap, she cried out, 'Oh, no!' and the motorcade went on . . . The wounds perhaps could be fatal . . ."'America's Long Vigil', ''TV Guide'', Issue 565, Vol. 12, No. 4 (January 25, 1964), p. 79 For three and a half days there was no entertainment, no Advertising, just the news. Cronkite's reporting of Vietnam was Controversy. He reported the events on the evening news. But at the Tet Offensive he traveled there to see the results. What he saw upset him. On February 27, 1968, Cronkite reported the war in Vietnam could not be won. This was a major change from his usual Objectivity (journalism) reporting. He was voicing his own opinion on national television. It was the view of David Halberstam and others that Cronkite's broadcast turned many Americans against the war. Also that it played a part in Lyndon B. Johnson's decision not to run for another term as President of the United States. The other viewpoint is that Americans had already turned against the war before Cronkite's broadcast. After watching Cronkite's broadcast, Lyndon Johnson said to his press secretary, George Christian, "If I have lost Walter Cronkite, I’ve lost Middle America." Whatever effect Cronkite's broadcast had, by 1967 Johnson's approval rating on the war was down to 32%. == Personal life == Cronkite was married to Mary Elizabeth "Betsy" Maxwell from 1940 until her death in 2005. They had three children. Cronkite died on the morning of July 17, 2009 in New York City, New York (state) from cerebrovascular disease, aged 92. == References == == Other websites == * [http://www.nasa.gov/vision/space/features/cronkite_ambassador_of_exploration.html Walter Cronkite Honored by NASA with a Moon Rock as an Ambassador of Exploration] * [http://homepage.mac.com/mooncusser/iMovieTheater215.html Walter Cronkite Narration] for Chatham Radio WCC documentary by Mooncusser Films * [http://www.hsus.org/humane_living/memorial_and_planned_gifts/hsus-special-friends/walter_cronkite_loving_animals.html Walter Cronkite: A Living Legend Still Loving Animals] * [http://www.interfaithalliance.org/cronkite/bio.htm Biography on InterfaithAlliance] * [http://www.spacefacts.de/bios/candidates/english/cronkite_walter.htm Spacefacts biography of Walter Cronkite] * [http://www.arrl.org/ARToday/ Amateur Radio Today (video)] * [http://cronkite.asu.edu/ Walter Cronkite School of Journalism at Arizona State University] * [http://www.utexas.edu/inside_ut/tvspot University of Texas TV ads] * [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/walter-cronkite Cronkite's personal blog] * [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004847/ Cronkite's filmography on IMDB] * [http://cronkitezine.asu.edu/ Web ZIne from the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism at Arizona State University] * [http://www.kruegerbooks.com/books/sig/cronkite-walter.html Signature of Walter Cronkite] * [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i214f5-w19w YouTube clip of Cronkite's famous Tet Offensive commentary on February 27, 1968 edition of ''CBS Evening News''] Category:1916 births Category:2009 deaths Category:American television news anchors Category:American war correspondents Category:Deaths from cerebrovascular disease Category:American Emmy Award winners Category:Peabody Award winners Category:Presidential Medal of Freedom recipients Category:Writers from Missouri
