File:Uno.jpg '''''Uno''''' (stylized on usual branding as '''UNO''') is an United States card game that was made by Merle Robbins in 1971. It has since been bought by a company named Mattel. It uses 108 special cards made just to play ''Uno''. It is similar to Crazy Eights. The cards are put into four different groups: Red cards, green cards, blue cards and yellow cards. There are also some other cards called: Skip, Reverse, Draw +2, Wild, and Wild +4 cards allows players to do something they cannot normally do, such as pick up two more cards. Each player starts off with seven cards, randomly assigned. A card from the main deck is then placed in the center for everyone to see. The first player must put down a card that is either the same color or number, then the next person in turn order has to put down another card of the same color or number, and it keeps on going in order. When a skip card is played, the next player loses the turn. A reverse card reverses the order of the game. A wild card (Card with four colours) can be placed above any colour, and the player chooses what colour they want everyone to continue with until someone puts down a card with the same number but a different color or a wild card. +2 cards force the next player to draw two cards, but +4 cards force the next player to draw four cards and the current player gets to pick a new color of their choice.
