It is the second-largest metropolitan area and city in the United Kingdom. About 1.1 million people live in Birmingham. Around 4.3 million people live in its metropolitan area. Many people call it the "second city" of the United Kingdom. == History == File:Bell Edison Telephone Building.jpg building in Birmingham, faced with terracotta tiles]] Birmingham began as a small town in 1166. Victoria of the United Kingdom gave city status to Birmingham in 1889. Many industry were developed in Birmingham during the 18th and 19th centuries. These included making weapons and food. Birmingham manufacturing industry played a big role in the war effort in World War I and World War II. The WWII spitfire aeroplane was made in Birmingham. In 2000, a statue of Sentinel (sculpture) was erected next to the old factory site. The factory now makes Jaguar cars. Birmingham had a large car making industry. It has declined since the 1980s. It remains the home town for Jaguar (car) and Land Rover cars. In 1974, twenty-one people were killed in the Birmingham pub bombings. == Transport == === Grand Union Canal === Birmingham was an important stagine-post in the Victorian industrial canal system. Today it is the northern terminus of the Grand Union Canal to London. Heavy goods (as coal surely is) are most economically moved on water. No other form of transport is so efficient. === Motorways === File:Spaghetti-Junction-Crop.jpg]]The M40 motorway connects to London via Oxford. The M6 motorway also connects Birmingham to London (via the M1 motorway) and to the north-west of England and Scotland. Junction 6 of the M6 is also one of Birmingham's landmarks, and probably the most notable motorway junction in the UK, Gravelly Hill Interchange, officially called the Gravelly Hill Interchange. Other motorways are: * The A38 road which links Spaghetti Junction to the city centre *The M5 motorway, connecting Birmingham to the south-west of England *The M42 motorway, which connects Birmingham to Tamworth, Staffordshire and the East Midlands *The M6 Toll, which enables through traffic on the M6 to bypass Birmingham and Wolverhampton. Birmingham, unlike London and Manchester, does not have a single orbital motorway. Instead, three motorways form a box which surrounds most of the city. These are: *The M42 motorway to the south and east. In the middle, the M40 motorway ends. It has priority for traffic going from the M40 to the M42 west. The M40 goes off south to Warwick, Oxford, High Wycombe, Uxbridge and London. *The M5 motorway which forms the western section. *The M6 motorway which forms the northern section. The M5 ends on the M6.
