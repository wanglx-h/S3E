File:Blandford's fox 1.jpg (''Vulpes cana'') photographed in southern Israel. It is a small fox with a long, bushy tail. The tail is a counterbalance when running or climbing. This fox occurs in the mountainous parts of the Negev and Judean Deserts, on rocky slopes. They feed mostly on beetles, grasshoppers, ants and termites.]] A '''fox''' is a small mammalian carnivore. They hunt and eat live prey, mostly rabbits and rodents (squirrels and mice). They may also eat grasshoppers, birds' Egg (biology), and even fruit and Berry. Sometimes they eat carrion.These exceptions do not really make foxes omnivores, better to say they are not entirely carnivores. Foxes are the smallest members of the dog Family (biology) Canidae. Twelve species belong to the ''Vulpes'' genus of monophyletic "true foxes". There are about another 25 living or extinct species which are sometimes called foxes. The fox has pointed ears, narrow snout, and a bushy tail. Foxes are swift and agile runners which live in family groups. A female fox is called a ''vixen'', and a male is called a ''dog''. Foxes' tails are multi-purpose organs. Their bushy tail helps them keep warm while they are sleeping in cold weather. It is also part of the animal's food store for wintertime.[http://www.arctic.noaa.gov/report12/arctic_fox.html NOAA report] Foxes' plump, bushy tail is easily seen, and is used for sending signals to its family members. The tail is also used for wikt:balance while running. Foxes are found on all continents (except Antarctica), mostly living in forest, shrubland, and desert regions. They were not native to Australia, but were introduced in some way. The most common fox species is the red fox. Red foxes have reddish-brown fur, and the tail tip is white. In the United Kingdom, it was a common sport for people to Hunting foxes with horses and dogs. This is now banned. Later, foxes starts having subtypes such as Fennec, for example. :"Most Farming damage is caused by rabbits, and this can be considerable. Yet in lowland areas, rabbits comprise 45 to 70 per cent of the diet of foxes... One study estimated that, over its lifetime, each fox was worth between £150 and £900 in increased revenue to farmers... A strong argument against killing foxes".BBC Wildlife == True foxes == The informal term 'true fox' refers to members of the '''''Vulpes''''' genus. There are 12 species of ''Vulpus''.
