It is a Crown dependencies of the British monarchs. Jersey is a bailiwick. The '''Bailiwick of Jersey''' also includes the islands of the Minquiers and Écréhous, where nobody lives. The other islands of the Channel Islands belong to the Bailiwick of Guernsey. The country code (also used for internet) is '''JE'''. Over 106 000 people live on the main island. Thirty per cent of them live in its only town, Saint Helier. Along with English language and French language, more than two thousand people speak Jèrriais, a local variation of the Norman language. == Politics == Jersey is not a part of the United Kingdom or of the European Union, but the Charles III is the King of Jersey as well. It has its own parliament called the ''States of Jersey'' which passes laws for the island. The ''Chief Minister'' of Jersey is in charge of the government. Since the 2022 election, Kristina Moore has been the Chief Minister. She is the first woman to have the job. Jersey is divided into 12 parishes which elect their own politicians and have control over some roads and the ''Honorary'' (volunteer) police. == History == File:John Singleton Copley 001.jpg People have lived in the area for about 6,000 years. This was before the sea level went up and made Jersey an island. There are many very old buildings like . The island was joined to Normandy in 933. Normandy then took control of England in 1066, but Jersey was still in Normandy, not in England. In 1204, John of England lost his land in France, but the Channel Islanders wanted to be ruled by the List of English monarchs, not the List of French monarchs. Because the Channel Islands chose England over France, the English kings let them have their own laws and governments. During the English Civil War (1642-1651), the future Charles II of England stayed in Jersey because the important Islanders supported the monarchy. When he became King, Charles II gave one of these people a colony in United States, which became New Jersey. In 1769, there was not a lot of food and the rich were selling food made in the island to other countries. Many islanders went to St Helier, rioted and took over the Royal Court. In 1771, the British Government made changes, like introducing a single book of laws and stopping the Royal Court making laws in the future without the States Assembly. Jersey was invaded by the French in the Battle of Jersey in 1781. Major Pierson led an army to fight the French in the Royal Square and won, but he died in the fight. In Victorian times, the island become more British. More people started to talk in English and more English people moved to the island. During World War II, Jersey was controlled by the Nazi Germany. It was freed on 9 May 1945, which is called Liberation Day and is the national day of Jersey. == Geography == Jersey is an island. It is in the English Channel, a sea in between France and England.
