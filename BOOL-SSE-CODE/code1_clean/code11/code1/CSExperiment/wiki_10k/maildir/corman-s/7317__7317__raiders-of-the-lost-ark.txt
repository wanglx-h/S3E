The movie is about Indiana Jones, a globe-trotting archaeologist. He is competing with Nazi forces in 1936, to recover the long-lost Ark of the Covenant. ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' is the first movie of the ''Indiana Jones'' series. It was highly successful and there are four film sequels—''Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'', ''Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'', ''Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull'' and ''Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny''. ==Cast== * Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones * Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood * John Rhys-Davies as Sallah * Denholm Elliott as Marcus Brody * Paul Freeman as Rene Belloq * Ronald Lacey as Arnold Toht * Wolf Kahler as Colonel Dietrich * Alfred Molina as Satipo ==Plot== In 1936, Indiana Jones is trying to find a golden idol in the jungle in Peru. His guide, Sapito, betrays him and tries to take the idol for himself, but is killed in a trap. After Jones comes out from the temple, he finds his rival Belloq and a dozen of the native people holding spears. Jones gives up the idol and runs to his airplane. While he is teaching at Marshall College, the U.S. Army tells him the Nazis are trying to find the Ark of the Covenant. Jones wants to find it first, so he goes to a bar in Nepal. His old teacher, Abner Ravenwood, was trying to find the Ark and has the headpiece to the Staff of Ra, a piece that is needed to find the Ark. His daughter, Marion, now runs Abner's bar and she punches him in the face because they had a romance and he ran away. She, however, comes along with him after the Nazi Arnold Toht and his friends try to get the piece themselves. Jones and Ravenwood fly to Cairo and recruit a man named Sallah to help him out. They start digging in the area where they think it is. The Nazis capture Ravenwood and make Jones think that she is dead. Sallah and Jones do some calculations and realize that the Nazis are digging in the wrong area because their staff is too long. Jones finds the right place and starts digging, finding it in a place called the Well of Souls. However, Belloq comes back, raises the Ark, and throws Ravenwood in there. They escape. After a battle, Jones gets the Ark back. Sallah puts it on a ship which sails across the Mediterranean Sea, but the Nazis on a U-boat intercept the ship and search it. Jones escapes. He then takes a big weapon called Panzerschreck and threatens to blow up the Ark as it is being loaded onto a Greece island north of Crete. Belloq calls Jones' bluff, and Jones lowers his weapon. He and Marion are then tied up as Belloq and the Nazis test the power of the Ark by opening it. The spirits inside kill everyone. Jones and Marion close their eyes and escape the spirits' anger. At the end of the movie, the Army puts the Ark inside a warehouse. They tell Jones that they are studying it, but Jones does not believe them. Marion tries to comfort him by saying that she will buy him a drink. == Production == Lucas first had the idea of the ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' in the early 1970s.
