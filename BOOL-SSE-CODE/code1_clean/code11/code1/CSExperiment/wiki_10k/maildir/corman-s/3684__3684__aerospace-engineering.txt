'''Aerospace engineering''' is a field of engineering that specializes in vehicles that move in Fluid dynamics. This usually means working with airplanes, cars, boats, trains, or spacecraft.''Encyclopedia of Aerospace Engineering''. Wiley & Sons. October 2010. As with other engineering, people who work in Aerospace engineering must study. This depends on what they want to do. Aerospace engineers (who design and oversee repair of vehicles) study for years at a university or college and earn a Degree (school). Technicians (those who repair and construct vehicles) will do a shorter course and 'on the job' training. Aerospace jobs include astronauts, pilots, and other professionals. ==Notes== Category:Aerospace engineering
