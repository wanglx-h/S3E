It tells the story of Jesus Christ, his followers, and the beginnings of Christianity. It was written in Ancient Greek. The New Testament is made up of different parts. In total, there are 27 texts in the New Testament. The Eastern Orthodox Church, the Roman Catholic Church and the Protestantism have the same texts, but their arrangement varies; the Syriac Orthodox Church and the Ethiopian Churches have different versions. The Syriac Churches do not put Peter 2, John 2 and 3, Jude and the Revelations in the New Testament. The Ethiopian Churches do not have a common canon. Four of the Books of the New Testament are the Gospels. Most of the others are Epistle. == The Four Gospels == Each of the Gospels tells the story of Jesus Christ, or the young Messiah, who Christians believe is the "Son of God who is born to save the world from sin".
