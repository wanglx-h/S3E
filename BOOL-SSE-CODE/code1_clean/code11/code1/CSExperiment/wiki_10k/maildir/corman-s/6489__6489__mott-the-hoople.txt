Category:English rock bands Category:English hard rock bands Category:Musical groups established in 1969 The band began in 1969 after Ian Hunter's audition of 'Like A Rolling Stone' by Bob Dylan to join the band as the lead singer. Their first hit was 'All The Young Dudes' which was written by a close friend of theirs and also admirer, David Bowie. Bowie produced their album of the same name, which also added to their success. Mott The Hoople also staged a performance in the USA with Queen as their opening performance, also leading to more success. However, in November of 1974, whilst preparing to record a new Mott the Hoople album with guitarist, Mick Ronson in New York, Hunter collapsed and was hospitalized with nervous exhaustion. He and Ronson quit the band soon after. The band split up, but are still partially known to this day.
