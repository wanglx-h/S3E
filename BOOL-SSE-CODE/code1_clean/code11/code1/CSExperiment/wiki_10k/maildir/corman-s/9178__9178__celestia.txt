It was created by Chris Laurel and is licensed under the General Public License. The program is based on the Hipparcos Catalogue (118,218 Stars) and allows users to display objects from satellite (artificial) to entire galaxy in three dimensions in OpenGL. Different from other planetarium software, the user is free to travel in the universe. NASA and European Space Agency have used Celestia, but it is not to be confused with Celestia 2000, ESA's own program. On 31st October 2022, a Chinese game developer named Linfeng Li created a mobile version of Celestia for Android (operating system) devices. == Related pages == * Astronomy ==References== }} Category:Software Category:Astronomy
