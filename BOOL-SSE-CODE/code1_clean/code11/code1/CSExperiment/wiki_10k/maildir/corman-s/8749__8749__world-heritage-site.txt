File:World Heritage Logo global.svg File:Yellowstone Castle Geysir Edit.jpg is a World Heritage Site]] '''World Heritage Sites''' are places in the world which are very important from a Culture or natural point of view. A part of the United Nations called UNESCO selects these sites. The World Heritage Convention ("Convention Concerning the Protection of World Cultural and Natural Heritage") is a United Nations treaty. It governs how World Heritage Sites are selected and wikt:protection. Nations that have agreed to the treaty elect 21 countries to the UNESCO World Heritage Committee. As of 2011, World Heritage Committee members are: Australia, Bahrain, Barbados, Brazil, Cambodia, China, Egypt, Estonia, Ethiopia, France, Iraq, Jordan, Mali, Mexico, Nigeria, Russian Federation, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, and United Arab Emirates. That committee sets the list of sites.According to the UNESCO World Heritage website, [http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/ States Parties] are countries that signed and ratified [http://whc.unesco.org/en/convention/ The World Heritage Convention]. As of November 2007, there are a total of 186 States Parties. Each site is a place or a thing (such as a forest, mountain, lake, desert, monument, building, complex, or city). , there were 1007 sites in 161 different countries. These included 779 cultural sites, 197 natural sites, and 31 mixed properties (which are both naturally and culturally important).[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list World Heritage List], UNESCO World Heritage Sites official sites.[http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/453 Twenty-seven new sites inscribed], UNESCO World Heritage Sites official sites. Italy has 50 World Heritage Sites - more than any other country. Each World Heritage Site is part of the legal territory of the nation where the site is located. UNESCO wants everyone in the world to work to wikt:protect each site. Sometimes UNESCO provides funds to help protect a site. Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant have destroyed some sites. ==Selection== The UNESCO selection committee has held a session each year since 1977. The first session was held in Paris, France. At these sessions, the committee choses which applications for World Heritage Site status are added to their list. When something is added to the list, it is said to be "''inscribed''" on the list. The entry on the list is called an ''Inscription''. ==Selection criteria== Until the end of 2004, there were six [https://simple.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/criteria criteria] for cultural [https://simple.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/heritage heritage] sites and four criteria for natural heritage sites. In 2005, a single set of ten criteria replaced the old cultural and natural heritage criteria. To qualify as a World Heritage Site, nominated sites must meet at least one of the ten criteria; they must also be of "outstanding universal value." If a site meets both cultural and natural criteria, it is called a "mixed site". ===Cultural criteria=== File:Taj Mahal 2012.jpg, an example of cultural heritage site]] "represents a masterpiece of human Creativity genius and cultural significance" "exhibits an important interchange of human Value (personal and cultural), over a span of time, or within a cultural area of the world, on developments in architecture or technology, monumental arts, Urban planning, or landscape design" "to bear a unique or at least exceptional testimony to a cultural tradition or to a civilization which is living or which has disappeared" "is an outstanding example of a type of building, architectural, or Technology ensemble or landscape which illustrates a significant stage in human history" "is an outstanding example of a traditional human Settler, land-use, or sea-use which is [https://simple.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/representative representative] of a culture, or human interaction with the environment especially when it has become vulnerable under the impact of irreversible change" "is directly or tangibly associated with events or living traditions, with ideas, or with beliefs, with artistic and Literature works of outstanding universal significance" ===Natural criteria=== File:Zerbras drinking.jpg, an example of natural heritage site]] File:Machu Picchu (2406619740).jpg, an example of mixed heritage site]] "contains [https://simple.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/superlative superlative] natural [https://simple.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/phenomena phenomena] or areas of exceptional natural beauty and [https://simple.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/aesthetic aesthetic] importance" "is an outstanding example representing major stages of History of the Earth, including the record of life, significant on-going Geology processes in the development of landforms, or significant geomorphic or physiographic features" "is an outstanding example representing significant on-going Ecology and Biology processes in the evolution and development of Terrestrial animal, Fresh water, coastal and Marine biology ecosystems, and communities of plants and animals" "contains the most important and significant natural habitats for in-situ Conservation biology of Biodiversity, including those containing threatened species of outstanding universal value from the point of view of science or conservation" ===Legal status of designated sites=== UNESCO designation as a World Heritage Site provides ''prima facie'' evidence that such culturally sensitive sites are legally protected pursuant to the Laws of war, under the Geneva Conventions, their articles, protocols and customs, together with other Treaty including the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict and international law. Thus, the Geneva Convention treaty promulgates: "Article 53. PROTECTION OF CULTURAL OBJECTS AND OF PLACES OF WORSHIP. Without prejudice to the provisions of the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict of 14 May 1954,' and of other relevant international instruments, it is prohibited: :(a) To commit any acts of hostility directed against the historic monuments, works of art or places of worship which constitute the cultural or Spirituality heritage of peoples; :(b) To use such objects in support of the military effort; :(c) To make such objects the object of reprisals." ==Images== file:Persepolis 06.jpg|Persepolis, Iran file:Il Duomo Florence Italy.JPG|Historic centre of Florence in Tuscany (Italy) File:Liberty-statue-from-below.jpg|The Statue of Liberty (United States) File:UluruClip3ArtC1941.jpg|Uluṟu-Kata Tjuṯa National Park (Australia) File:Chichen-Itza-Castillo-Seen-From-East.JPG|Chichen Itza in Yucatán (state) (Mexico) File:Sankt Petersburg Auferstehungskirche 2005 a.jpg|Historic Centre of St. Petersburg, Russia and its suburbs (Russia) File:武当山三清殿.JPG|Ancient Building Complex in the Wudang Mountains (China) File:Chogoria valley from Nelion.jpg|Mount Kenya National Park (Kenya) File:VicFalls.jpg|Victoria Falls of the Zambezi River in Africa File:Taj Mahal in March 2004.jpg|The Taj Mahal in India File:Gizeh Cheops BW 1.jpg|Memphis, Egypt and its Necropolis, including the Giza pyramid complex (Egypt) ==References== == Other websites == * [http://whc.unesco.org/en/list List of UNESCO World Heritage Sites]—Official website * [http://ocean.si.edu/blog/world-heritage-goes-marine World Heritage Site – Smithsonian Ocean Portal] * [http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1636166,00.html ''TIME magazine''.
