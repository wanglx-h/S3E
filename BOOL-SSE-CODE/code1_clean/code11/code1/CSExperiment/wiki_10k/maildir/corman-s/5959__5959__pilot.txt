All types of pilots must pass tests and obtain a license before they can operate the vehicle. Step By Step Guide For Pilot training|url=https://thepilot.in/pages/how-to-become-a-pilot/|access-date=2024-11-03|website=|language=en-US}} ==Overview== An aircraft pilot is usually in charge of a flying machine for the whole trip. Some larger aircraft have both a pilot and a co-pilot so one can rest while the other works or both can work at busy times such as take-off and landing. Drone pilots usually stay on the ground and operate the machine by radio control. Sometimes one pilot handles several drones at the same time. Maritime or ship pilots usually only guide the ship through an especially difficult place such as a harbor which they have carefully studied. They are usually aboard only during this passage. ==References== == Other websites == *''[https://goldenepaulettes.com/how-to-become-pilot How to Become a Pilot]'': A guide to aviation training and career pathways.
