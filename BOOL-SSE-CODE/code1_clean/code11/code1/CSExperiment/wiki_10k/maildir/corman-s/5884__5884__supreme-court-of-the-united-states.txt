Because of this, the Court leads the Judicial Branch of the United States Federal Government. It is the only U.S. court established by the United States Constitution. Its decisions are supposed to be followed by all other courts in the United States. Since 1935, the Court has met in United States Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C.; before that, it met in the United States Capitol. ==Background== There are 9 justices on the court now: one Chief Justice of the United States and eight Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. Courts (a set of all justices of the court while one Chief Justice is serving) are unofficially named for the Chief Justice; the current Court is called the "Roberts Court" after Chief Justice John Roberts. The Supreme Court chooses which wikt:cases it will decide on, by choosing to give a Writ#Types of writs or not. Almost 7,000 people, known as ''petitioners'', ask the Supreme Court to decide their cases every year, but the court only gives a ''writ'' to about 100 or less. For the Supreme Court to decide a case, the case must be about: federal law, the Constitution of the United States, disagreements between states or their residents, or another court's decision that differs from what the Supreme Court has decided on a similar case. Cases ''must'' first be decided by a United States district court and a United States courts of appeals or by a state supreme court. Even after that, the Supreme Court can choose not to decide a case for any reason. Cases about disagreements between states or their residents sometimes can only be decided by the Supreme Court, but those are rare. The justices serve for life unless they retire or are impeachment. If a justice retires, he or she can still be asked to serve as a judge on a federal Court of Appeals. New justices are ''nominated'' (picked) by the President of the United States, and then must be approved by the United States Senate. The most recent justice to be chosen is Ketanji Brown Jackson, who was nominated by President of the United States Joe Biden in February 2022, to replace retiring Justice Stephen Breyer. After the Senate approved her, Jackson became the first female African Americans justice. ==The current Court== {| class="wikitable sortable" style="text-align:center" |- ! rowspan=2 colspan=2 style="min-width: 150px /* without these none of the images will display on a mobile device.
