He made an error in calculating his remaining fuel levels and fatally crashed directly into the ocean near Lover's Point, Pacific Grove, after the plane ran completely out of gas. After a thorough investigation completed by the National Aviation Services and supporting law enforcement, it was deemed that he was too confined within the limited space of his plane to successfully engage his reserve tank. Denver was 53 years old; his remains were cremated, and his ashes were scattered in the Rocky Mountains. == References == 5. https://gulfnews.com/today-history/october-12-1997-singer-john-denver-dies-in-plane-crash-1.2104320 Category:1943 births Category:1997 deaths Category:American country guitarists Category:American country singers Category:American folk singers Category:American pop singers Category:American singer-songwriters Category:Singers from New Mexico Category:Aviation deaths in the United States Category:John Denver Category:Writers from New Mexico Category:Roswell, New Mexico
