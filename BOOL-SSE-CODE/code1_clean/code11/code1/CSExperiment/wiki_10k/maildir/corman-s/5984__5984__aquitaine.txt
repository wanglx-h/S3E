Its Capital (city) was Bordeaux, the largest city. The French language name of the people living in the region is ''Aquitain''. The five Departments of France in the region were Dordogne, Gironde, Landes, Lot-et-Garonne, and Pyrénées-Atlantiques. ==Geography== The Aquitaine region was the third largest region of Metropolitan France, after Midi-Pyrénées and Rhône-Alpes.

The Prime Meridian passes through Aquitaine. Most of Aquitaine is in the Aquitanian basin,A basin, or sedimentary basin, is a low place in the Earth that gets filled with dirt and rocks. a relatively flat and Geology young landscape. High mountains are found only in the south of Aquitaine, in the Pyrenees mountain range. The Pic Palas (), at , is the highest point of Aquitaine; it is on the border with Spain. The main rivers of the region are the Garonne river, that flows through the Gironde and Lot-et-Garonne departments; the Dordogne (river), that flows through the Dordogne and Gironde departments; the Lot (river), that flows through the Lot-et-Garonne department; the Dropt, that flows through the Dordogne, Gironde and Lot-et-Garonne departments; and the Adour, that flows through the Landes department.
