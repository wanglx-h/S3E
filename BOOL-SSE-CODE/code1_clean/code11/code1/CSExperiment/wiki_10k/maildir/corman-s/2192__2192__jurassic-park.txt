'''''Jurassic Park''''' is a 1990 science fiction novel by Michael Crichton. It was Jurassic Park (movie) a movie in 1993 directed by Steven Spielberg. As a story, Jurassic Park is a "going back in time" story, without actually going back in time. It's impossible, but like H. G. Wells's many books, or Conan Doyle's ''The Lost World'', it is futurist but imaginary. == Plot == In Costa Rica, strange reports of children and infants being killed by vicious animals suddenly occur through this peaceful place. One of the species behind the attacks is a Procompsognathus, an extinct dinosaur species. A paleontologist and his colleague are contacted to confirm the murderous animal's identity, but become aruptly whisked away by John Hammond and are unable to deal with the killings. Hammond reveals that he has created a park known as Jurassic Park, a place full of living dinosaurs of all types. The recent attacks by the creatures have made Hammond's investors skittish. Later, throughout the course of the story, Dennis Nedry steals some embryos from the park, and goes off into a jungle. Nedry hears a strange thing, and encounters a Dilophosaurus, a species of Ceratosauria. It spits at Nedry and kills the latter. At the end of the book, the dinosaurs escape the island. == Characters == === Movie === * Dennis Nedry * Dr. Henry Wu * Dr. Alan Grant * Dr. Ellie Sattler * John Hammond * Ray Arnold * Robert Muldoon * Donald Gennaro === Characters that were not added in the movie === * The infant * Elena Morales the midwife * The Infant's mother * Ed Regis == Related pages == * Jurassic Park (movie) == Other websites == * [http://www.jurassicpark.com Jurassicpark.com] * [https://jurassicmainframe.forumotion.com/publi Jurassic Main Frame News] Category:20th-century American novels Category:Jurassic Park Category:American science fiction books Category:1990 books Category:Dinosaurs in fiction Category:Horror novels Category:Movies about dinosaurs
