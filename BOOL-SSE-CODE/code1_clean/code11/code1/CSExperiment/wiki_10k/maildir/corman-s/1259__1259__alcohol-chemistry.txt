In chemistry, '''alcohol''' is a general term which refers to many organic compounds used in industry and science as reagents, solvents, and fuels. Common alcohols include rubbing alcohol, ethanol, methanol, ethylene glycol, glycerin, and phenol. Simple alcohols are made of an alkyl functional group with one or more hydroxyl () groups bound to its carbon atoms. They are often transparent colorless liquids. == Names for alcohol == There are two ways of naming alcohols: Common names, and IUPAC names. * Common names often are made by taking the name of the alkyl group, and adding the word "alcohol". For example, "methyl alcohol" or "ethyl alcohol". * IUPAC names are made by taking the name of the alkane chain, removing the last "e", and adding "ol". Examples of this are "methanol" and "ethanol". == Properties == The hydroxyl (OH) group makes alcohols polarity (chemistry), and they can form hydrogen bonds. Alcohols are weakly amphoteric, meaning they are both a weak acid and a weak base (chemistry): they react with strong bases to make alkoxide anions, and strong acids to make oxonium cations. Most alcohols are highly flammable. == Common alcohols == The simplest two alcohols are methanol (or methyl alcohol) and ethanol (or ethyl alcohol), which have the following structures: File:Methanol Lewis.svg|Methanol File:Ethanol-2D-flat.png|Ethanol IUPAC nomenclature is used when describing more complex alcohols. In common usage, "alcohol" often means ethanol or "grain alcohol". (See also: alcoholic proof). Other commonly used alcohols include: * Isopropyl alcohol (''sec''-propyl alcohol, propan-2-ol, 2-propanol) , or "rubbing alcohol" * ethylene glycol (ethane-1,2-diol) , which is the main substance in antifreeze (coolant) * glycerin (or glycerol, propane-1,2,3-triol) , bound in natural fats and oils, which are triglycerides (esters of glycerol and fatty acids) * phenol , an alcohol where the hydroxyl group is bound to a benzene ring.
