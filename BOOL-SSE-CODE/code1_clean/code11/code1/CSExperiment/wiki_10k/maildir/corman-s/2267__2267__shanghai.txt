File:2012 Pudong.jpg skyline in Shanghai]] File:Shanghai in China (+all claims hatched).svg '''Shanghai''' (, ; Mandarin pronunciation: ) is the biggest city in China and one of the world's largest cities. It had about 24,000,000 people in 2017. It is a special Chinese province in China ("municipality"), like Beijing, Tianjin, and Chongqing. ==Name== File:Shanghai (Chinese characters).svg]] The Mandarin Chinese name of Shanghai is ''Shànghǎi'', which is written as in Chinese characters. This name means "On-the-Sea" because Shanghai used to be next to the East China Sea. Today, silt from the Yangtze River has made Pudong New Area much bigger and Huangpu District is about from the open sea. The city has become so big, though, that its government now controls other areas like Pudong and Fengxian District that are still beside the sea. Shanghai's name is a little simpler than most other Chinese cities' names, because it was a small fishing village for a long time. The abbreviation in Chinese is still ''Hù'' (}}). A hu was an old kind of fishing trap that was made with bamboo and nets. The people around Shanghai used to use them to catch fish and crabs in Suzhou Creek and other waterways. ==Geography== File:Sprawling Shanghai 2016-07-20.jpg Shanghai is at the mouth of the Yangtze River, where it meets the East China Sea in the middle of China's east coast. Downtown Shanghai is located just south of the place where Suzhou Creek meets the Huangpu River. This is about southwest of where the Huangpu meets the Yangtze River. The area between downtown and the Yangtze used to be farmland and other cities like Wusong and Baoshan, but now Shanghai is so big that they are part of it. ==History== File:Bloody Saturday, Shanghai.jpg after the Japanese bombing of Shanghai (1937)]] For most of China's history of China, Shanghai was a small fishing village. The big cities nearby were Suzhou and Hangzhou. Under the Ming dynasty and Qing dynasty, Shanghai had a big city wall and started to grow. Under the Ming and the Qing, people from other countries could only buy and sell things with China on an island near Guangzhou. The British people effectively controlled Shanghai from the mid 19th century until World War II. Parts of Shanghai were controlled by the United Kingdom, the United States, and France. This control was ended by the Japanese during World War II. The Chinese Communist Party was founded in Shanghai. ==Landmarks== File:Shanghai (22098028539).jpg and Jinmao Tower, Shanghai Tower, and Oriental Pearl Towers]] Shanghai attracts many tourists each year.
