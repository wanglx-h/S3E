The strings are plucked or bowed to produce sounds. Each string has a different frequency. The desired frequency can be obtained by adjusting the tension on the string. The strings on these instruments usually come in many shapes and forms. There are many types of stringed instruments, the most common of these appearing in the Violin family. The Violin is a small, stringed instrument played with a bow, usually made of horse's hair. When the bow is drawn across the strings it creates vibrations which in turn create sound. You can alter the pitch by pressing your fingers on the fingerboard. A Violin is commonly tuned to G, D, A and E. The Viola is a very similar instrument aside from some small differences. It's slightly larger, and is tuned to C, G, D, and A. The Cello is another stringed instrument that is played in the bass clef. It's much bigger than the Violin, and is also played much differently. There are also plucked strings, the most famous of which would probably be the guitar. The guitar uses a fret board and a pick to pluck the strings while holding down on the fret board. It was made famous by rock groups like Led Zeppelin and artists like Eric Clapton. You play by strumming with one hand while choosing notes on the fret-board (string board) with the other. Banjos are also very similar. You can also pluck a violin, this is called Pizzicato.
