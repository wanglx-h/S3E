Image:Flag of Europe.svg]] The '''Council of Europe''' (, ) is an international organization of 47 member states in the European region. One of its first successes was the European Convention on Human Rights in 1950, which serves as the basis for the European Court of Human Rights. The seat of the Council of Europe is in Strasbourg on the France-Germany border. The original meeting place was in the city's Strasbourg University Palace. The Palais de l'Europe, about two kilometres from city centre, has taken its place. Membership is open to all European democracy which accept the principle of the rule of law and guarantee fundamental human rights, civil rights and Freedom (political) to their citizens and respect of rights of minority groups. The Council of Europe is not to be confused with the Council of the European Union or the European Council, as it is a separate organisation and not part of the European Union. But all member states of European Union are also the member states of Council of Europe. On 15 March 2022, Russia is excluded from Council of Europe because of 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/the-russian-federation-is-excluded-from-the-council-of-europe The Russian Federation is excluded from the Council of Europe] ==Note== ==Related pages== *European Union *European Convention on Human Rights *European Court of Human Rights *Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe *European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages *Istanbul Convention == Other websites == *[http://www.coe.int/ Council of Europe] - Official site Category:Council of Europe Category:1949 establishments in Europe Category:Strasbourg
