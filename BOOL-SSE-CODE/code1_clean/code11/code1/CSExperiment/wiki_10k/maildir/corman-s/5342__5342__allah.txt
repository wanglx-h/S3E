File:اللہ کا نام.jpg '''Allah''' ( Literal translation 'The God') is the common name for God in Arabic language. It is similar to '':en:El_(deity)'', the name for God in Hebrew language, and ''Alaha'', the name for God in Aramaic language. Muslims commonly use the word ''Allah'' for God."Islam and Christianity", encyclopedia|title=Allah|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam Online|access-date=7 January 2015|author=L. Gardet Sometimes, people who speak Arabic still use the word ''Allah'' when they speak English. == In Arabic == ===Where the word comes from=== Around 2000 BC (4000 years ago) a group of people called the Canaanite lived in the Middle East. They had Polytheism, and the ruling god was called El. According to their beliefs, El created the earth and everything else. They believed El had total power, ruled over everything, and lived forever. Later, the word ''El'' became ''Eloh'' or ''Eloah'' in Aramaic. Hebrew changed the Aramaic word to ''Eloah''. In the New Testament (the second book in the Christian Bible), the words ''Eli'' and ''Elohi'' were used to mean god. ''El'' is also in some people's names, such as ''Gabriel'', ''Mikael'', ''Azrael'', ''Israel'', ''Yishmael'', and ''Emanuel.'' === As a common noun === In Arabic, the general word for a god is ''ilaah''. It can mean a specific god, or any god at all, depending on how it is used. === As a proper noun === As a proper noun, ''Allah'' is a name for one God: the god of the Abrahamic Religion. In Arabic, the word ''al'' is an article (grammar) (a word for ''the''), so ''al-ilaah'' means ''Panentheism''. Usually, Muslims use the word ''Allah''. However, Arab people of different faiths also refer to God as ''Allah''. The name ''Allah'' is made of four letters in Arabic: (or Alif Lam Lam Ha, from right to left, A-L-L-H, 2111), which when brought together to make الله == In Islam == There are many Names of God in Islam.

Both names are mentioned in the Hebrew Bible and are among the seven names of God in Judaism. In Judaism, Elohim is the Title of God. Muslims call God ''Allahuma'' when praying to Him. These words are similar because both Arabic and Hebrew are Semitic languages. == In Christianity == Arab Christians refer to God in Arabic as ''Allah''. In the Arabic translation of the Christian Bible, God is called ''Allah''. The word ''Allah'' was also used in old translations of the Bible into Turkish language due to Islamic culture being common in Turkey, and because Turkish was influenced by Arabic. ==References== Category:Islamic terminology Category:Gods and goddesses Category:Arabic words and phrases Category:God
