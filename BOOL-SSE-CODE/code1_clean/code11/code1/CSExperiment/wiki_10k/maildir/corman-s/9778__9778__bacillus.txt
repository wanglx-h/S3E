'''''Bacillus''''' is a genus of rod shaped bacteria. They are Gram-positive, meaning they have an extra outside cell layer. Bacilli are partly or wholly aerobic. They do aerobic respiration. They are every where in nature. ''Bacillus'' includes both free-living (non-parasitic) and parasitic pathogenic species.Turnbull P.C.B. 1996. Bacillus. In: Baron S. ''et al'' (eds) ''Barron's medical microbiology''. 4th ed, Univ of Texas Medical Branch. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7699/] Under stressful conditions, they produce endospores. These are not true spores, but like survival pods they can stay in a dormant state for long periods. Some species of ''Bacillus'' are worth noting: *''Bacillus anthracis'', which causes Anthrax (disease). *''Bacillus subtilis'' is considered an model organism. It is often used in genetic engineering.Graumann P (ed) 2012. ''Bacillus: cellular and molecular biology''. 2nd ed, Caister Academic Press. [http://www.horizonpress.com/bacillus] *''Bacillus cereus'' which is responsible for a form of food poisoning. *''Bacillus thuringensis'' which is used in pest control. It produces a toxin which can kill some moths, and certain butterfly.
