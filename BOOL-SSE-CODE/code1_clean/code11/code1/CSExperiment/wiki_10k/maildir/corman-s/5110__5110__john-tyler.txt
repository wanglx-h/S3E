He was the first Vice President of the United States to become president after the president before him died. He was also the first president born after the United States Constitution was ratified. ==Before presidency== Tyler grew up in Virginia and became a lawyer. His father was also a lawyer who later became governor of Virginia. Tyler became a state representative in the United States Congress, and then also became governor of Virginia like his father. Tyler started in government as a member of the Democratic Party, but later he changed to the Whig Party (United States), which was very new. He was chosen to run as vice president next to William Henry Harrison. Whig Party people used to say "Tippecanoe and Tyler Too" to get people to vote for them. (William Henry Harrison was famous for being a general in a battle in a place called Tippecanoe, and that was his nickname.) Harrison and Tyler won the election, but Harrison died one month later. Tyler then became president. == Presidency == Because Tyler had not been elected to hold the office of President, some people thought that he lacked a claim to the position. But as the United States Constitution says that the Vice President is vested with the responsibilities of the Presidency in case of "Death, Resignation or Inability" of the former, Tyler said this meant the position was his to fill. A majority of the government agreed and he was sworn in as the new president, however, the Whig Party did not want Tyler, and a lot of Whigs ended up calling him "the accidental president" or "His Accidency". This was after Tyler had angered the Whigs when he decided to mainly pick people from the Democratic Party to work in his government. He wanted to bring the two parties to together, but instead this ended up making him unpopular. He also rejected many of the Whigs' ideas. This all lead to the Whig Party deciding not to back his run for the presidency in 1844. While he was president, Florida became a new state. After winning their independence in the Texas Revolution against Mexico, Texas had become its own country. Tyler sought to annex Texas and turn it into a new U.S. state while in office, but this did not come to fruition until a few months after his term had ended. == After presidency == The Whig Party did not want Tyler to be president again, and did not pick him to run for president in 1844. He had some friends in the Democratic Party who sometimes asked him for ideas, but that party did not like him enough to be president, either. Tyler was sometimes called "the President without a party" since both groups did not want him. When the Confederate States of America was created, Tyler did not want a civil war. But he voted that Virginia had to join the Confederate States. He was elected to the Confederate congress. Tyler died in Richmond, Virginia on January 18, 1862 of a stroke. Tyler's death was the only one in Presidential history not to be wikt:officially recognized in Washington, D. C. because of his loyalty to the Confederacy. His coffin was covered with the Confederate flag. He is the only United States President ever to be buried and honored wikt:ceremony under a wikt:foreign flag that is not the United States flag. ==Other websites== * [https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/presidents/john-tyler/] ==References== Category:1790 births Category:1862 deaths Category:Deaths from stroke Category:Chancellors of the College of William & Mary Category:United States senators from Virginia Category:United States representatives from Virginia Category:Presidents pro tempore of the United States Senate Category:John Tyler Category:19th-century American politicians Category:Vice presidents of the United States Category:19th-century presidents of the United States
