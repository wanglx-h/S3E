Subject: Dimmu Borgir
'''Dimmu Borgir''' is a black metal band created in 1993 in Norway. Its name is Icelandic language for a "dark castle". The band's first recordings were in Norwegian language, but today, most of the recordings are in English language. The newest studio album is "Abrahadabra" (2010). The studio album ''In Sorte Diaboli'' (2007) entered the Norwegian album chart at No. 1 — the first time a black metal band has ever got to the No. 1 position on a national album chart anywhere in the world. Dimmu Borgir's previous release, "Death Cult Armageddon", as well as Satyricon's "Now, Diabolical" previously reached No. 2 position on the Norwegian album chart. A week after "In Sorte Diaboli" reached No. 1 on the Norweigan album charts, the album attained No. 43 on The Billboard 200, making them the first Norwegian band since the 80's pop group 'A-HA' to enter the U.S. Top 50. "In Sorte Diaboli" features the London Philharmonic Orchestra. Strangely, the album has been banned by the UK album charts for questionable reasons. == Members == === Current === * Shagrath (Stian Thoresen) - vocals * Silenoz (Sven Atle Kopperud) - guitar === Former === * Nicholas Barker - percussion * Tjodalv - percussion * Nagash - bass * Astennu - guitar * Stian Arstad - keyboards * Brynjard Tristan - bass * ICS Vortex - bass * Mustis - keyboards * Hellhammer - percussion * Archon - guitar * Snowy Shaw - bass * Galder - guitar ===Session=== * Daray (Dariusz Brzozowski) - drums * Cyrus - keyboard == Discography == === Albums === * ''For All Tid'' (1994, 1997) * ''Stormblåst'' (1996, 2005) * ''Enthrone Darkness Triumphant'' (1997, 2002) * ''Spiritual Black Dimensions'' (1999) * ''Puritanical Euphoric Misanthropia'' (2001) * ''Alive in Torment'' (2002) * ''Death Cult Armageddon'' (2003) * ''Stormblåst MMV'' (2005) * ''In Sorte Diaboli'' (2007) * ''Abrahadabra'' (2010) *''Eonian'' (2018) ===EP=== * ''Inn I Evighetens Mørke'' (1994) * ''Devil's Path'' (1996) * ''Godless Savage Garden'' (1998) * ''Alive in Torment'' (2002) * ''World Misanthropy'' (2002) * ''Interdimensional Summit'' (2018) === Live albums and other releases === *Alive in Torment (2001) *World Misanthropy (2002) *World Misanthropy (2002) *The Invaluable Darkness (2008) ==References== == Other websites == * [http://www.dimmu-borgir.com/ The official Dimmu Borgir page] Category:Black metal bands Category:Norwegian heavy metal bands Category:Musical groups from Oslo Category:1993 establishments in Europe Category:Musical groups established in 1993 Category:1990s establishments in Norway
