Meteorology is a major branch of earth science. Meteorologists study the causes of particular weather conditions using information obtained from the land, sea and upper Atmosphere of Earth. They use computerized and mathematics models to make short and long-range Weather forecast concerning weather and climate patterns. A variety of organizations use meteorological forecasts including: *transport services, particularly Air travel and Ship *shipping and sea fishing industries and sailing organisations *government services, e.g. firefighters or for advice on climate change policy *Military *farmers; *service sector *mass media *industry and retail businesses *Insurance *Health care In addition to forecasting, meteorologists study the impact of weather on the environment and conduct research into weather patterns, climate change and models of weather prediction. ==Related pages== *World Meteorological Organization ==References== Category:Meteorology
