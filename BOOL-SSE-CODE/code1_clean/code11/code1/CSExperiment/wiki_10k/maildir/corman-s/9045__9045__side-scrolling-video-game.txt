A '''side-scrolling video game''' is a video game where the player goes toward one side of the screen, either to the left or the right, although this is different for each video game. A famous side-scroller is ''Super Mario Bros.'' The character usually moves from left to right but sometimes it is the other way around. In the golden age of video games, Side scrollers were a big thing and they still are to this day. Category:Side-scrolling video games Category:Video game genres Category:Video game graphics
