File:Orestes Pursued by the Furies by William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1862) - Google Art Project.jpg The '''Erinyes''' (or '''Eumenides''') were the goddesses of revenge in Greek mythology. They are also known as the '''Furies'''. These three female divinities were named '''Alecto''', '''Tisiphone''', and '''Megaera'''. ==Description== The Erinyes were born from Mother Earth and the blood of Uranos. They avenged family crimes such as matricide and patricide. They also tormented evil men in the "Hell" of the underworld, Greek underworld. The Erinyes forever followed a person who did a crime. They even could make the person go insanity. They are often shown with snakes on their heads, blood coming out of their eyes, and looking horrific. ==In stories== A well known story about the Erinyes is that of Orestes. Orestes' mother Klytaimnestra, and her lover Aegisthos, killed Orestes' father Agamemnon. The god Apollo told Orestes to kill the murderers of his father, which he did. Orestes was then pursued by the Erinyes for his crime. With the help of Athena and Apollo Orestes went to a court in Athens. It was decided that Orestes acted correctly and nobody should hurt him. Even the Erinyes accepted the decision, and from then on they were also called '''Eumenides''', which means "the kind ones", because they could also let people go in peace if their crime was done for a good reason. ==Other websites== *[http://www.theoi.com/Khthonios/Erinyes.html The Theoi Project, "The Erinyes"] Category:Greek gods and goddesses
