Subject: Cabal
A '''cabal''' is a group of people who control or try to control affairs in society or within an organization secretly or dishonestly. Cabals are often a theme of a Conspiracy theory. People sometimes say "There Is No Cabal", or TINC, to mean "There Is No Cabal". The joke is that since a cabal is necessarily secret, only those who are in the cabal can know. == Politics == The former chief of staff, Lawrence Wilkerson, of the Secretary of State Colin Powell said that the foreign policy of George W. Bush's administration were run by a "Cheney-Donald Rumsfeld cabal". With this word he meant that the President had not really the power that he is given by the constitution and that the Vice President and the Secretary of Defense had more influence than they should have. ==Related pages== * Oligarchy * Deep state * Antisemitism#Lies about Jews * ''The Protocols of the Elders of Zion'' ==Other websites== * [https://www.thejc.com/judaism/jewish-words/cabal-npl05kli Cabal] * [https://reformjudaism.org/beliefs-practices/spirituality/what-kabbalah What is Kabbalah?] * [https://www.ajc.org/translatehate/cabal cabal #TranslateHate AJC] * [https://www.enar-eu.org/wp-content/uploads/debunkingmyths_lr.pdf Debunking Myths about Jews] * [https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/protocols-of-the-elders-of-zion An Antisemitic Conspiracy: The Protocols of the Elders of Zion] * [https://forward.com/fast-forward/440449/20-of-european-survey-participants-say-secret-jewish-cabal-runs-the-world 20% of European survey participants say secret Jewish cabal runs the world] == References == Category:Forms of government
