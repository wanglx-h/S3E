They published their first album in 1997. Soon after that, Comeau left the band because school was more important to him. He came back in 1999 and founded ''Simple Plan'' with Sebastien Lefebvre and Jeff Stinco. Bouvier met up with Comeau at a Sugar Ray concert, and Comeau offered Bouvier to join his band. David Desrosiers, who had replaced Bouvier in Reset, joined the band in 2000. In 2002, they published the album ''No Pads, No Helmets,... Just Balls''.
