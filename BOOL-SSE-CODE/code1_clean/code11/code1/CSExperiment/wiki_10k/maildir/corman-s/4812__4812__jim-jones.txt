His church was called the "People's Temple". It began as a Christian church (a member church of the Disciples of Christ) (Jones was an atheist). Over time, it became a cult. Jones and most of the members of his group died on November 18, 1978 in Guyana. Jones died when he committed suicide on that day after forcing most of the members of his group to drink poison. == Visit by Congressman Ryan, murders == In November 1978, U.S. Congressman Leo Ryan led a fact-finding mission to Jonestown to investigate allegations of human rights abuses.Reiterman, Tom; Jacobs, John 1982. Raven: the untold story of Rev. Jim Jones and his people. Dutton, Ryan's delegation included relatives of Temple members, Don Harris (journalist), an NBC network news reporter, an NBC cameraman and reporters for various newspapers. The group arrived in Georgetown, Guyana on November 15. On November 17, Ryan's delegation traveled by airplane to '''Jonestown'''. The delegation left hurriedly the afternoon of November 18 after Temple member Don Sly attacked Ryan with a knife. The attack was thwarted, and the visit ended. Congressman Ryan and his people took with them fifteen People's Temple members who had expressed a wish to leave. At that time, Jones made no attempt to prevent their departure. === Port Kaituma Airstrip shootings === As members of Ryan's delegation boarded two planes at the airstrip, Jones' "Red Brigade" armed guards arrived in a tractor-pulled trailer and began shooting at the delegation.[http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Surviving-the-Heart-of-Darkness-Twenty-years-2979166.php Zain, Maitland 1998. Surviving the Heart of Darkness. SFGATE] The guards killed Congressman Ryan and four others near a twin engine Otter aircraft. At the same time, one of the supposed defectors, Larry Layton, drew a weapon and began firing on members of the party that had already boarded a small Cessna. An NBC cameraman was able to capture footage of the first few seconds of the shooting at the Otter. The five killed at the airstrip were Congressman Ryan; Don Harris, a reporter from NBC; Bob Brown, a cameraman from NBC; San Francisco Examiner photographer Greg Robinson; and Temple member Patricia Parks. Surviving the attack were future Member of Congress Jackie Speier, then a staff member for Ryan; Richard Dwyer, the Deputy Chief of Mission from the U.S. Embassy at Georgetown; Bob Flick, a producer for NBC News; Steve Sung, an NBC sound engineer; Tim Reiterman, a ''San Francisco Examiner'' reporter; Ron Javers, a ''San Francisco Chronicle'' reporter; Charles Krause, a ''Washington Post'' reporter; and several defecting Temple members. === Deaths in Jonestown === Later that same day, 909 inhabitants of Jonestown,[http://jonestown.sdsu.edu/AboutJonestown/WhoDied/whodied_list.php Who died?] , Alternative considerations of Jonestown, San Diego State University 303 of them children, died of apparent cyanide poisoning, in and around a pavilion.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/18/newsid_2540000/2540209.stm 1978: Mass suicide leaves 900 dead.] BBC, November 18, 2005 This was the greatest single loss of American civilian life in a non-natural disaster until the September 11, 2001 attacks.Rapaport, Richard, [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/11/16/INGEM3070J1.DTL&type=printable Jonestown and City Hall slayings eerily linked in time and memory], San Francisco Chronicle, November 16, 2003 No video was taken during the mass suicide, though the FBI did recover a 45-minute Death tape.Jim Jones, [http://jonestown.sdsu.edu/AboutJonestown/Tapes/Tapes/DeathTape/Q042.html Transcript of recovered FBI tape Q 42.] Alternative Considerations of Jonestown and Peoples Temple. Jonestown Project: San Diego State University. On that tape, Jones tells Temple members that the Soviet Union, with whom the Temple had been negotiating a potential exodus for months, would not take them after the Temple had murdered Ryan and four others at a nearby airstrip. The reason given by Jones to commit suicide was consistent with his previously stated conspiracy theories of intelligence organizations allegedly conspiring against the Temple, that men would "parachute in here on us," "shoot some of our innocent babies" and "they'll torture our children, they'll torture some of our people here, they'll torture our seniors". Parroting Jones' prior statements that hostile forces would convert captured children to fascism, one temple member states "the ones that they take captured, they're gonna just let them grow up and be dummies". Jones and several members argued that the group should commit "revolutionary suicide" by drinking cyanide-laced grape-flavored Flavor Aid. However, later released video made to show the best of Jonestown shows Jones opening a storage container full of Kool-Aid in large quantities. This may have been what was used to mix the "potion" (as was referred to in several statements on the tape recordings) along with a sedative. One member, Christine Miller, dissents toward the beginning of the tape. When members apparently cried, Jones counseled, "Stop this hysterics. This is not the way for people who are Socialists or Communists to die. No way for us to die. We must die with some dignity". Jones can be heard saying, "Don't be afraid to die," that death is "just stepping over into another plane" and that it's "a friend". At the end of the tape, Jones concludes: "We didn't commit suicide; we committed an act of revolutionary suicide protesting the conditions of an inhumane world". According to escaping Temple members, children were given the drink first and families were told to lie down together. Mass suicide had been previously discussed in simulated events called "White Nights" on a regular basis.[http://jonestown.sdsu.edu/AboutJonestown/PrimarySources/BlakeyAffidavit.htm Affidavit of Deborah Layton Blakey.] Alternative considerations of Jonestown and Peoples Temple.

Jones was found dead in a deck chair with a gunshot wound to his head that Guyanese coroner Cyrill Mootoo stated was consistent with a self-inflicted gun wound. However, Jones' son Stephan believes his father may have directed someone else to shoot him.Jonestown: Paradise Lost, interview of Stephan Jones, documentary airing on Discovery Networks, 2007 An autopsy of Jones' body also showed levels of the barbiturate Pentobarbital which may have been lethal to humans who had not developed physiological tolerance.[http://jonestown.sdsu.edu/AboutJonestown/PrimarySources/autopsies/JimJones.pdf Autopsy of Jim Jones by Kenneth H. Mueller] , Jonestown Institute at SDSU Jones' drug usage (including LSD and cannabis (drug)) was confirmed by his son, Stephan, and Jones' doctor in San Francisco. == References == Category:1931 births Category:1978 deaths Category:American agnostics Category:American atheists Category:American communists Category:Christian religious leaders Category:Former Christians Category:Cults Category:People from Indiana Category:Religious violence Category:Suicides by firearm Category:Democrats (United States)
