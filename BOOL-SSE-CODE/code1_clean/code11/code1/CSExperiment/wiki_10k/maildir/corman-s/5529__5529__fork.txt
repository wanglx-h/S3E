The tines help to hold food in place for cutting with a knife, or to pick it up and lift to the mouth. Most forks today are made of metal. Some are made of plastic or wood. Thousands of years ago, some forks were made of bone. The word "fork" is also used to describe a two choices of course. A fork in the road is a split in the road leading in two (or more) directions.

Many countries do not use forks, but instead have their own ways, such as chopsticks. ==Related pages == * Garden fork * Spork Category:Basic English 850 words category:Food utensils
