The anthem is based on a poem written by an unknown poet from Japan about one thousand years ago. The music was composed more recently, about two hundred years ago; however, it had to be rewritten shortly afterwards, because the original tune was unpopular. Although popular for a long period and sung in situations where people from other country would usually sing their country's national anthem, "Kimigayo" was only considered as Japan's official national anthem in 1999. The law that stated this also defined the Flag of Japan in a similar way.

Because it is so short, the anthem is normally played very slowly. ==Lyrics== {|class="wikitable" cellpadding="15" rules="cols" !With Kanji characters!!Kana (Hiragana) only!!Romanization of Japanesehttps://web-japan.org/factsheet/en/pdf/11NFlagAnthem.pdf ''National Flag and Anthem'' (PDF).
