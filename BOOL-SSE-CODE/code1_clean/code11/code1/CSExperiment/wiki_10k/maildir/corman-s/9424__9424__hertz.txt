Frequency is how often something happens. A frequency of 1 hertz means that something happens once a second. While '''hertz''' or '''Hz''' are the standard ways to express this unit, other expressions are sometimes used, as shown in the table. The note Middle C (the C in the middle of the piano) is 261.65 (262)Hz. This means there are 262 vibrations every second, which is heard as the note Middle C, when that piano key is played. Humans are able to hear sounds between 20 and 20 000Hz. Owls are able to hear sounds between 200 and 12000Hz. The basic unit is per second. The unit is named after the German physicist Heinrich Rudolf Hertz. == Multiple units == 1000 hertz is 1 kilohertz. 1000 kilohertz is 1 megahertz, 1000 megahertz is 1 gigahertz: (see table) {| align="left" class="wikitable" |- !
