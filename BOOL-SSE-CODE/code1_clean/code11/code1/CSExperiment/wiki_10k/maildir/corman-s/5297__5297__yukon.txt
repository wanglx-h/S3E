Its population is around 47,000. Most of the territory's people live in the capital of Whitehorse. Many of the people are native Canadians (First Nations). The Yukon became a territory in 1898. It was part of the Northwest Territories from 1870 to 1898. Many people came to live in the Yukon during the Yukon Gold Rush of the 1890s. Mount Logan, at 5959 metres above sea level, is Canada's highest mountain. The most important industry in the Yukon is mining. ==References== Category:Yukon Category:1898 establishments in Canada
