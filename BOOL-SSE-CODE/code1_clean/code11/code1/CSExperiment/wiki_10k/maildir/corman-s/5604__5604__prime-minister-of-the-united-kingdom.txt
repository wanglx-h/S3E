The prime minister controls the Government of the United Kingdom through the Cabinet of the United Kingdom. The prime minister is the chairman of the British Cabinet of the United Kingdom and a member of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom. It is normal for the prime minister to be the leader of the political party which has a majority in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. The prime minister is not the head of state, but is the most important politician in Parliament. By tradition, the monarch of the United Kingdom chooses the prime minister. The monarch chooses the leader of the political party with enough votes to get laws passed in Parliament.Technically, it is expressed as: "the Parliament of the United Kingdom's approval for the British monarch's speech from the throne". Keir Starmer (Labour Party (UK)) became prime minister on 5 July 2024. ==Background== The Prime Minister (PM) is usually the leader of the political party which wins most seats in the House of Commons after a general election. There are 650 available seats in the Commons. In each general election the UK electorate vote for their own local member of parliament (MP) to represent their constituency, not for the prime minister. MPs represent their local constituency in the chamber to vote for bills which eventually become laws or statutes, if successful. The prime minister is a member of parliament. The first prime minister was Robert Walpole in 1721. He was known as the "First Lord of the Treasury". The first person to be use the title "prime minister" officially was Henry Campbell-Bannerman in 1905. Well-known prime ministers in the 20th century included David Lloyd George, Stanley Baldwin, Winston Churchill, Clement Attlee, Margaret Thatcher, and Tony Blair.
