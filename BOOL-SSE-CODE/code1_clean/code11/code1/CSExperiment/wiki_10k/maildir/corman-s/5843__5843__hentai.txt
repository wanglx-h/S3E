File:Hadako-tan.png File:Hentai manga in Japan 002.jpg]] '''Hentai''' () is a style of Pornography in Japan anime and manga. In addition to anime and manga, hentai works exist in a variety of media, including artwork and video games (commonly known as ''eroge''). The word '''Hentai''' literally means "strange appearance", but also means "perverted". Hentai, because of this, is a word used by countries outside of Japan to show Pornography and sex-related anime, manga and video games. The word is not used to mean this in Japanese language. In Japan, terms such as ''ecchi'' are used. The word hentai is sometimes used to apply to cartoon characters that are not anime characters. Hentai is the anime version of porn. There is on screen sex, often very graphic and very imaginative. Since hentai is anime, the performers are not bound by Physical law. Makers of hentai often use this in very creative ways. Some of the acts performed in hentai would be physically impossible. Some of the performers are often impossible themselves. Fairies, monsters, and even new and strange creatures are stars of hentai. Monsters and demons with tentacles are seen so often that “Tentacle rape” is its own sub-category of hentai. Most of the hentai (anime)-films in the late 1990s to the present day are based on H-Game, where the goal is to date the girls in the game and have sexual intercourse with one or more of them. The games feature various character-types, like a bookworm, a tough girl, a younger girl, and a tomboy. Ero-games can include highly taboo themes, such as coprophilia or dismemberment, pedophilia (also called lolicon and shotacon), and rape. Sometimes slightly less taboo subjects, such as incest. Famous hentai films and series include: * ''Cream Lemon'' (1984) * ''Urotsukidôji'' (1987) * ''La Blue Girl'' (1992) * ''Night Shift Nurses'' (2000) * ''Bible Black'' (2001) * ''Boku No Pico'' (2006) Category:Pornography Category:Anime and manga terms
