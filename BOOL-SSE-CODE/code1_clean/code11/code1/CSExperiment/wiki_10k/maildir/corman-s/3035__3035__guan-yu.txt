File:Three Brothers (Bei, Yu, Fei).jpg '''Guan Yu''' (? – 220) was a Chinese general officer. He helped Liu Bei to fight the dynasty of Cao Wei, which had seized the throne from the last Han Dynasty. He was also the best friend of Zhang Fei, another warrior of Liu Bei. They conquered the Southwest of China and founded a Dynasty named Shu Han because Liu Bei claimed to be the rightful heir of the Han Dynasty. They also battled with Eastern Wu, another Chinese dynasty at the time, and during one of the battles, Guan Yu was captured by the Wu general Lü Meng and executed by Sun Quan, along with his son Guan Ping. In later centuries, Guan Yu became a Chinese deity and was given the name Guan Gong, meaning "Lord Guan."
