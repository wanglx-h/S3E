Don't worry about making mistakes, we can easily fix them. If you need help when making changes, first visit the Help:Contents. If you are still confused, ask a classmate or your teacher. If you are not in the classroom together write a note on their talk page. You can also ask an Wikipedia:Administrators. Remember, not everyone will be online, so don't expect an instant reply! ---- {| style="width:100%; background:transparent;" | '''Wikipedia:Student tutorial/page5''' | '''Wikipedia:Student tutorial/page7''' |} Category:Wikipedia Schools
