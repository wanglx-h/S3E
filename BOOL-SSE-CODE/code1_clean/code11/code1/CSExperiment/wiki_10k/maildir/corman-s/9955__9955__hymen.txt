The '''hymen''' (also called '''maidenhead''') is tissue that surrounds or partially covers the external vaginal opening. The hymen has no known use. People used to believe that the hymen always tears after having sexual intercourse for the first time, and that you could tell if a woman was a virgin by looking at her hymen and seeing if it was torn. However, it turns out that it is impossible to tell if someone is a virgin by looking at their hymen. Studies have confirmed that all girls are born with hymens. == Types == There are several different types of hymen. In about 1 in 2,000 females, the hymen does not develop at all. The hymen may also not have a hole in it; this is called an "imperforate hymen". In this case a hole will need to be Surgery cut into it to allow Menstruation (period blood) out.Chang, Lisbeth and Muram, David. (2002) "Pediatric & Adolescent Gynecology" in DeCherney, Alan H. and Nathan, Lauren. ''Current Obstetric & Gynecological Diagnosis & Treatment'', 9th edition, McGraw-Hill, 598-602. Other types are: * crescent-shaped * forming a ring around the vagina * folding in on itself * has one or more bands going across the opening * has several holes == What might damage the hymen == When a girl reaches puberty, the hymen becomes elastic. The hymen may be damaged by girls fall directly onto sharp objects .Emans, S. Jean. "Physical Examination of the Child and Adolescent" (2000) in ''Evaluation of the Sexually Abused Child: A Medical Textbook and Photographic Atlas'', Second edition, Oxford University Press. 64-5 Sexual intercourse is another easy way to damage the hymen along with horseback riding and biking. A woman's hymen can also break while playing some sports == Hymens in other animals == These animals all have a hymen: {| width="100%" | width="33%"| * Squirrels * Gazelles * Frogs * Bats * Cats * Chimpanzees | width="33%"| * Dogs * Elephants * Llamas * Guinea pigs * Horses * Bears | width="33%"| * Zebras * Lemurs * Manatees * Rats * Pinniped |} There are many more animals which have hymens, but not all are listed here. == The stages of growth == When a fetus is developing, there is no vaginal opening. The hymen comes from the skin covering the vagina at that time.1918 Gray's Anatomy In wikt:young babies, the hymen is thick and pink. This is because the mother is giving the baby hormones through breast feeding which keeps it thick. In puberty girls, the hymen becomes thin, smooth and delicate because she has stopped taking in hormones. The hymen becomes very nerve and can easily cause pain if touched. From puberty, the hymen gets thicker again and becomes pale pink. This is because of the hormone estrogen. == Gallery, references == file:Hymen en.svg file:Haultain_and_Ferguson_-_external_female_genital_organs.svg == References == == Other websites == *[http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo/?article=anatomy&refid=027 The Female Hymen and its Significance] *[http://www.healthystrokes.com/hymengallery.html Hymen gallery] - Pictures of hymens *[http://www.the-clitoris.com/f_html/hymen.htm The Hymen Revealed] - by The-Clitoris.com Category:Anatomy of the female reproductive system
