It is the first language of about 113 million people in the world. It is also spoken in Haryana, Himachal Pradesh states of India and in capital Delhi. It is spoken by the largest ethnic group in Pakistan at 36%. Punjabi developed from the ancient language of Prakrit developed simultaneously with Sanskrit. Punjabi is written in two different Writing systems, called Gurmukhī and Shahmukhī. Punjabi is the main language spoken by the Sikhs. Most parts of the Guru Granth Sahib use the Punjabi language written in Gurmukhī, though Punjabi is not the only language used in Sikh scriptures. The ''Janamsakhis'', stories on the life and legend of Guru Nanak Dev (1469–1539), are early examples of Punjabi literature. ==Dialects== File:Dialects Of Punjabi.jpg Punjabi language has many dialects.

Some major dialects of Punjabi include Majhi, Puadhi, Malwai, Pothwari, Shahpuri dialect, Jhangvi, Jatki, Bilaspuri, Jangli, Jhagvi, Ghebi, Doabi dialect among others.Grierson, George A. 1904–1928.

It is spoken in the centre of Panjab, including the districts of Lahore, Sheikhupura District, Kasur, Okara Tehsil, Nankana Sahib, Faisalabad, Gujranwala, Sialkot District, Narowal Tehsil, Gujrat Tehsil, Pakpattan, Hafizabad District and Mandi Bahauddin.
