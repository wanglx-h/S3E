Babylonia's capital city was Babylon, which meant ''The Gate of the Gods''. They built an empire out of the lands of the former Akkadian Empire. ==Geography== Mesopotamia is the region of the two rivers, Euphrates and Tigris. At that time the region also included the city states of Assyria to the north, and Elam to the south-east. It is part of the Fertile Crescent in the Middle East. It was there people first lived together in a civilization, with farming, cities and writing. == Old Babylonia == File:F0182 Louvre Code Hammourabi Bas-relief Sb8 rwk.jpg (or possibly Marduk).

Babylonian.jpg The Babylonians had a Writing system that they used for trade and communication. They got it from the Sumerians, who invented it. The Babylonians used the same cuneiform system of pressing triangular shapes into soft clay. They wrote in two different languages: Sumerian for religious purposes and Akkadian language for official purposes. ===Laws=== Hammurabi was a king of Babylon who fought wars. He made Babylonia into an empire by putting Assyria under a vassal (puppet) king. He made the earliest written set of Law, the ''Code of Hammurabi''. It has 280 Judgment. It is still placed on display today in the Louvre of Paris, France. The earlier Sumer Punishment had not been harsh, but Babylonian law was quite severe. The death penalty was given for theft, murder and other Crime. ===Buildings=== The houses in Babylon had open roofs, so that on hot nights, the family could sleep there. The Living room, dining rooms, and the Kitchen were, of course, downstairs. Lamp burned with olive oil, and every house had a chapel for burial and worship ceremonies. Since Mesopotamia had only clay for use in building, the strong Wood supports for the houses were Import from Lebanon. Eventually, residents began baking their Brick and improved the strength of their House. ==Sack of Babylon== Later, Babylon was sacked by the Hittite king Musilis I,Sacking a city: conquering it with much destruction. which led to the so-called ''Dark Ages'' of the Bronze Age, where there is little evidence in writing. ===Dating=== The date of the sacking of Babylon is Debate by Archaeology, who have proposed no fewer than four Chronology. Possible dates for the sack of Babylon are: *ultra-short chronology: 1499 BC *short chronology: 1531 BC *middle chronology: 1595 BC *long chronology: 1651 BC The difficulty is to line up the Mesopotamian dates with the Ancient Egypt dates. ===Later dynasties=== File:Assiri, regno di sennacherib, prisma a sei facce con iscrizione sulle 8 campagne militari del sovrano, 704-681 ac ca. 02.jpg), containing records of his military campaigns, ending in Babylon's destruction.

Next it was ruled by Elam, and then regained its independence for about three centuries. They were then conquered by the Neo-Assyria. A century later they again became Emancipation, to form the Neo-Babylonian or Chaldea Empire. This constant conquest and re-conquest is partly due to geography. There are no natural boundaries except the River, and it is easy to get at the City from north or south. The king Nebuchadnezzar II reigned for 43 years. He conquered Phoenicia in 585 BC. ==Cyrus the Great== The Babylonian empire was finally brought to an end by Cyrus the Great of Persia. It was in 549 BC that Cyrus put an end to the empire of the Medes. Three years later Cyrus had become king of the Achaemenid Empire (Persia), and was engaged in a campaign in northern Mesopotamia. In 539 BC Cyrus invaded Babylonia. A battle was fought at Opis in the month of June, where the Babylonians were defeated; and immediately afterwards Sippara surrendered to the invader. Two days after the capture of Sippara, "the soldiers of Cyrus entered Babylon without fighting". Cyrus did not arrive until the 3rd of ''Marchesvan'' (October), Gobryas having acted for him in his absence. Gobryas was now made governor of the province of Babylon. Cyrus now claimed to be the legitimate successor of the ancient Babylonian kings and the avenger of their god Bel-Marduk. The invasion of Babylonia by Cyrus was doubtless helped by the presence of foreign forced exiles like the Jews, who had been planted in the midst of the country. One of the first acts of Cyrus was to allow these exiles to return to their own homes, carrying with them the images of their god and their sacred vessels. The permission to do so was embodied in a proclamation, whereby the conqueror endeavored to justify his claim to the Babylonian throne. The feeling was still strong that none had a right to rule over Western Asia until he had been consecrated to the office by Bel and his priests; and accordingly, Cyrus henceforth assumed the imperial title of "King of Babylon." ==Food== Like the Sumer, the Babylonians ate Vegetable, Fruit, meat and fish. They also ate bread and enjoyed Toast and eating the pesky but crunchy locusts which destroyed their precious Crop. ==Art== The Babylonians loved art. Beautiful vessels ornamented with sparkling gold were buried with the kings. In those days books dealt with floods which were thought to be caused by sin, or about the journey of Abraham. ==Science== Science saw substantial improvement as well. The Babylonians Invention the first calendar, the Hour and advanced multiplication table. ==Life== Life was Wealth, full and usually Peace. People Pacifism or how to Defense (military) the city. As a result, Babylon was conquered in 730 BC by the Assyrian people and Kassite dynasty. This great civilization then ended. ==Related pages== * Levant * Holy Land * Ancient history * Classical antiquity * Abrahamic religions * Neo-Babylonian Empire == References == Category:Mesopotamia Category:Former countries in the Middle East Category:Achaemenid satrapies Category:2nd millennium BC
