When this happens, what is known as the Red Ring of Death (RRoD) appears: three of the four warning lights surrounding the power button on the console flash in red. The Red Ring of Death shows that there is a Computer hardware problem, which usually means that the console no longer works. The white Arcade console breaks down a lot. On later models for example, the Xbox 360 S, these three lights show that there is an over-heating problem. ==Related pages== *Xbox *Xbox (console) *Nintendo Wii *PlayStation 3 *Xbox One ==References== Category:Xbox Category:Seventh generation consoles
