'''Social capital''' is made when people spend time with others and build good Relationship. It is the help and worth that a person can get from their ties with other people. Social capital is like real Capital (economics). When a person or a group has more capital, it is easier to do things, and life is better. When there is less capital, life becomes harder, and the results are not good for people. The name social capital was first used by :en:Pierre_Bourdieu in 1977. He said it means all the real or possible help a person can get by being part of a group where people know each other and Trust (social science) each other. These people often follow the same rules and may know each other through their jobs. Later, in 2001, :en:Nan_Lin said that social capital comes from two things: what someone has, and who they know. Help comes from the people we know and speak with. People get help when they talk with others and work with others in their group or with people who have many friends and Support group. Most ways to measure social capital are about trust. People who trust that help will come when they need it are more likely to help others too. But if someone only takes help and gives nothing back, they will not get much help in the future. A person who tries to move up in society by becoming friends with others who have social capital but does not give help is called a social climber. Some call this person a social Parasitism. It is hard to see right away this kind of person, like someone who :en:wikt:cheat and commits fraud. When there are too many people like this, especially at work or in politics, people stop trusting others. For example, when Politician win by gaining people’s trust but use their power to hurt others or to help only their friends, people stop trusting the government. People who do not have real money often cannot get help from others. They may have to do things they do not want to do or force others to live in Shame lives. This is how organized crime grow, and how forced labor and slavery start. Society works best when there is a lot of social capital that can lead to help and support. But when social capital is low, social problems become worse. If there is no social capital at all, it can lead to Strike action, people fighting the government, or even war. ==References== ==Related pages== *Human capital *Social status ==Other websites== [http://www.socialcapital-foundation.org The Social Capital Foundation] Category:Social sciences Category:Economics
