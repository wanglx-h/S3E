They changed their singer twice in the late 1980s when Chris Collins was replaced by Charlie Dominici in 1987. Dominici left the band only three years later, in 1990, and James LaBrie joined and stayed until today. Dream Theater's keyboardist also changed three times. Kevin Moore played with the band from 1985 until 1995 when he left and Derek Sherinian took his position until 1999. Jordan Rudess is Dream Theater's Keyboardist now. He is known for his excellent technique and compositional skills. In September 2010, drummer Mike Portnoy left Dream Theater, and was replaced by Mike Mangini. Portnoy rejoined the band in 2023. == Influences == The members of Dream Theater are known for having excellent playing technique of their instruments, and for their songwriting. Their music is very complex and the songs are often long, their longest being ''Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence'' at 42 minutes in length. Their songs contain a lot of instrumental sections, in which no vocals are heard and only the instruments play (these parts are called "instrumental passages") and also many solo (music). Another feature of their music is that during each song, the speed often changes, and occasionally style changes too. They once said that other bands have trouble making long songs. They said they have trouble making "short" songs. Most of Dream Theater's music is very difficult to play because of the high speed it has to be played with and the complex rhythm. ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== *''When Dream and Day Unite'' (1989) *''Images and Words'' (1992) *Awake (Dream Theater album) (1994) *''Falling into Infinity'' (1997) *''Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory'' (1999) *''Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence'' (2002) *Train of Thought (Dream Theater album) (2003) *Octavarium (album) (2005) *''Systematic Chaos'' (2007) *''Black Clouds & Silver Linings'' (2009) *''A Dramatic Turn of Events'' (2011) *Dream Theater (album) (2013) *''The Astonishing'' (2016) *''Distance Over Time'' (2019) *''A View from the Top of the World'' (2021) *''Parasomnia (album)'' (2025) ==References== ==Other websites== * [http://www.dreamtheater.net Dream Theater's official website] Category:1980s American music groups Category:1990s American music groups Category:2000s American music groups Category:2010s American music groups Category:American heavy metal bands Category:Progressive metal bands Category:Musical groups from New York (state) Category:Warner Bros.
