'''Plasma''' is the 4th state of matter. Image:Plasma-lamp 2.jpg, showing some of the more complex things a plasma can do. The colors come from the gas in the lamp. Each type of gas makes a different color]] File:NeTube.jpgs often contain plasma. This one shows neon. The color of the tube gives a hint to the gas inside]] Plasma is created by adding energy to a gas so that some of its electrons leave their atoms. This is ionization. It results in negatively charged electrons, and positively charged ions. Unlike the other states of matter, the charged particles in a plasma react strongly to electric and magnetic fields (i.e. electromagnetic fields). If a plasma loses heat, the ions will re-form into a gas, emitting the energy which had caused them to ionize. Over 99% of the matter in the Observable universe is believed to be plasma. When the atoms in a gas are broken up, the pieces are called electrons and ions. Because they have an electric charge, they are pulled together or pushed apart by Electricity and magnetic fields. This makes a plasma act differently from a gas. For example, magnetic fields can be used to hold a plasma, but not to hold a gas. Plasma is a better Electrical conductor of electricity than copper. Plasma is usually very hot, because it takes very high temperatures to break the bonds between electrons and the nuclei of the atoms. Sometimes plasmas can have very high pressure, as in stars. Stars (including the Sun) are mostly made of plasma. Plasmas can also have very low pressure, as in outer space. On Earth, lightning makes plasma. Artificial (man-made) uses of plasma include fluorescent light bulbs, neon signs, and plasma displays used for television or computer screens. Plasma lamps and globes which are popular children's toys and room decorations. Scientists are experimenting with plasma to make a new kind of nuclear power, called fusion power, which would be much better and safer than Nuclear fission, and would produce much less radioactivity waste. == Related pages == *Gas *Liquid *Solid *Bose–Einstein condensate *Matter *Plasma window *Solar wind == Other helpful websites == * [http://www.plasmas.org/ Plasma Science and Technology] * [http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/PlasmaI.html Plasma on the Internet] comprehensive list of plasma related links. * Introduction to Plasma Physics: [http://silas.psfc.mit.edu/introplasma/index.html M.I.T.
