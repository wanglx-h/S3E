He is widely considered the greatest ragtime composer of all time. == Early life == Joplin was African-American and born in the U.S. state of Texas sometime between June 1867 and January 1868 and grew up in Texarkana, Texas. His relatives were railroad workers. His father wanted him to find work that would pay. His mother said he should learn music. Even though he was from Texas, most of his pieces were written when he was in Missouri and New York City. == Musical career == Joplin is most well known for writing piano pieces called rags. His music became popular again in the 1970s, with the album ''Scott Joplin: Piano Rags'', performed by Joshua Rifkin, from Nonesuch Records.''Scott Joplin: Piano Rags'', Joshua Rifkin, piano, vinyl LP, 1970, Nonesuch Records stereo H-71248 He may be most commonly known now by the Marvin Hamlisch adaptation of his composition ''The Entertainer'' (1902) which was used in the 1973 movie ''The Sting'' starring Paul Newman and Robert Redford. His best-known rag while he was alive was ''Maple Leaf Rag'' (1899). Other rags he wrote were ''The Ragtime Dance'' (1906) and ''Magnetic Rag'' (1914). Scott Joplin wrote more than 40 piano rags, but he also wrote two operas; ''A Guest of Honor'' and ''Treemonisha''. ''A Guest of Honor'' was performed in Joplin's lifetime, but since then the music has been lost. ''Treemonisha'' was never performed while Joplin was alive, but it has been performed since then. Joplin also wrote a symphony, but the music has been lost. == Death == Joplin died of syphilis in New York City on April 1, 1917. ==References== ==Bibliography== *Gildo De Stefano, ''Ragtime, jazz & dintorni''.
