It first flew in 1935, and was introduced in 1938. It had a shorter range, and a smaller bomb load, than its sister bomber the B-24 Liberator, but it had more defensive armament. It dropped large amounts of bombs during air raids against Germany, such as the raid on Dresden. The B-17 was also used in the Pacific Ocean, including the Battle of Midway. The Flying Fortress had its name for a good reason, it could survive the hits and was able to fly while under enemy fire. The B-17 was a heavy bomber plane that carried 2 tons of bombs. The reason why few B-17's survived WWII was because lack of escort by allied fighters and enemy fire. Later in WWII, the U.S. increased escort fighters for the bombers giving more protection. The escort fights flew until the end of WWII. The Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress was a large '''American aircraft''', and arguably one of the '''most successful''' or dangerous bombers. These 4-propeller destroyers could carry well over '''10,000 pounds of bombs,''' and can travel hundreds of miles without refuelling. Similar to other '''long-range bombers,''' the B-17 was armed with plenty of '''small turrets''' to cover all angles from anti-air. '''Flocks of these massive aircraft''' with escorts would be spotted from kilometres out, making them a '''large target for enemy Flak.''' == Technical data (Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress) == {| class="prettytable" |----- bgcolor="#DDDDDD" !
