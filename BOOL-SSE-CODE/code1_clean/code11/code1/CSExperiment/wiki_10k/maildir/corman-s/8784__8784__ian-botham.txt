He played in over 100 Test cricket for England. His best games were in 1981 when he helped England to beat Australia in a series that has come to be known as "Botham's Ashes". Despite his successes against Australia and some other countries, however, he was unable to help England defeat the dominant West Indies team of the time. Botham played county cricket for the Somerset, Worcestershire, and Durham clubs. After he retired from playing, he worked on television for many years as a cricket commentator. He has completed several long-distance walks to raise money for Charitable organization, and was knighted for his charitable work in 2007. He played Association football for Scunthorpe United, and also had an acting part as "James Brooke" in the 1980s TV drama series ''Howards' Way''. ==References== Category:1955 births Category:Living people Category:English and Welsh cricketers Category:English footballers Category:Sportspeople from Cheshire
