People usually drink milkshakes with a drinking straw and from a tall glass or cup. ==Comparison between smoothies and milkshakes== Milk shakes are similar to smoothies. Smoothies are a type of cold drink made with an electric blender. Smoothies are made with a liquid (either milk, fruit juice, or water), crushed ice or ice cubes, different fruits, and honey or maple syrup. ==In popular culture== Milk shakes and other cold drinks such as "ice cream floats" (a scoop of ice cream placed in a glass of cola or other carbonated Soft drink drink) or "malts" (a milk shake with malt powder added to it) were popular among teenagers in the rockabilly. Teenagers would go to ice cream parlors and order cold drinks. Category:Dairy products Category:Ice cream Category:American food
