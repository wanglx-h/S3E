It is internationally recognised as part of the Republic of Cyprus and only Turkey recognises it as a separate state. Three hundred thousand Muslim Turkish Cypriots live in its 3,335km². Turkey is the only country which recognizes the territory as an independent republic despite the international sanctions and embargoes in place. Cyprus was conquered and became part of the Ottoman Empire from 1570 to 1914. Many Ottoman Turkish people became settlers. As the Ottoman Empire sided against the British empire in World War I, the British annexed Cyprus. In 1923, by the Treaty of Lausanne Turkey gave up the island to the British Empire which in 1925 converted it to a crown colony. The British administered it from 1878 until 1960. Cypriot Turk males are circumcised, because Sunni Islam is the main religion. In 1974, Turkish Cypriots were killed at the Maratha, Santalaris and Aloda massacre, in response to a growing conflict with Greece, the Turkish army invaded and occupied Cyprus. Many settlers from mainland Turkey came from Turkey into the northern part of the island. The move drew international condemnation and Northern Cyprus remains unrecognized by the United Nations. Since 1974, the United Nations has established a ceasefire line between Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots. The ''Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus'' was formed in 1983 and Rauf Denktaş became the first president. Negotiations for a unified island have been held several times without success. Northern Cyprus, despite its international pariah status, stands out amongst other "frozen conflict" zones as having a relatively stable and democratic form of government with high levels of political freedom and civic engagement in the political process. The Gurbeti-Roma are a Xoraxane Roma Muslim subgroup, who settled in Cyprus since it was part of Ottoman Empire. They speak Gurbetca an own Romani dialect and Cypriot Turkish. ==References== == Other websites == * [http://www.trncinfo.com Government of the TRNC] * [http://www.zypern.cc/ Zypern Times] * [http://www.zypern.cc/nordzypern/ Nordzypern Almanac] * [http://www.north-cyprus-information-map.com/ North Cyprus Information Map] - A directory and information source for Northern Cyprus.
