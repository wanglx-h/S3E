The '''Daihatsu Motor Company Ltd.''' makes small cars and trucks. The company is part of the same manufacturing group that includes FAW Group Motor Ltd. The company was set up in 1907. Examples of their cars are the Daihatsu Charade, the Rocky Four Wheel Drive SUV and the Daihatsu Copen. Daihatsu cars and trucks are notable for their rugged construction and high level of finish. After a brief, unsuccessful attempt at the United States market toward the end of the 20th century, the company withdrew from the U.S. in 1999. The Subaru Sambar is also made by this company. 1951 == Current production vehicles == {| class="wikitable sortable" style="text-align: center; width: 110%" ! rowspan="2" |Body style ! colspan="4" |Model ! colspan="2" |Current model ! rowspan="2" |Main markets ! rowspan="2" class="unsortable" width=30% cellpadding=30px |Vehicle description |- ! class="unsortable" width="15%" |Image !Name(s) ! class="unsortable" width="15%" |Also called !Introduction( year) ! width="9%" |Introduction (model code) ! class="unsortable" width=9% |Update/Facelift (automotive) |- ! rowspan="6" |Kei car |File:Daihatsu ATRAI RS 2WD (3BA-S700V-ZBXZ) front.jpg !Daihatsu Atrai | |1981 |2021(Daihatsu Hijet#S700) | - | rowspan="6" | Japan |Up-class version of the Hijet Cargo kei microvan. |- |File:Daihatsu Copen Robe.jpg !'''Daihatsu Copen''' |Toyota Copen GR Sport |2002 |2014(Daihatsu Copen#LA400) | - |Two-seater front-wheel-drive kei convertible sports car. |- |File:Daihatsu Mira e-S X"SA III" (DBA-LA350S) front.jpg !'''Daihatsu Mira e:S''' |Toyota Pixis EpochSubaru Pleo |1980 (Mira)2011 (Mira e:S) |2017(Daihatsu Mira e:S#LA350) | - |Entry level, low-roof hatchback kei car with hinged rear doors. |- |File:Daihatsu MOVE CANBUS THEORY G Turbo 2WD (5BA-LA850S-GBPZ) front.jpg !'''Daihatsu Move Canbus''' |- |2016 |2022(Daihatsu Move Canbus#LA800) | - |Retro-styled kei car with rear sliding doors. |- |File:The frontview of Daihatsu TAFT G Turbo 2WD (5BA-LA900S-GBGZ).jpg !'''Daihatsu Taft (LA900)''' |- |1974 (nameplate)2020 (as a kei crossover) |2020(Daihatsu Taft) | - |Semi-tall height rugged crossover SUV-styled kei car. |- |File:Daiahtsu Tanto X 2WD (6BA-LA650S-GBGF) front.jpg !'''Daihatsu Tanto''' |Subaru Chiffon |2003 |2019(Daihatsu Tanto#LA650) |2022 |Tall-height wagon kei car with rear sliding doors with an absence of a Pillar (car) (pillarless opening) on the left side of the car. |- |- |- ! rowspan="2" |Kei truck |File:Daihatsu HIJET CARGO CRUISE (3BD-S700V-ZMGF).jpg !Daihatsu Hijet |Toyota Pixis VanSubaru Sambar Van |1960 |2021(Daihatsu Hijet#S700) | - | rowspan="2" | Japan |Rear-wheel-drive (all-wheel-drive optional), Mid-engine design kei commercial microvan with rear Sliding door (car) with the emphasis on rear cargo space. |- |File:Daihatsu HIJET TRUCK JUMBO EXTRA 2WD (3BD-S500P-ZBGF) front.jpg !Daihatsu Hijet |Toyota Pixis TruckSubaru Sambar TruckDaihatsu Hi-Max (Indonesia) |1960 |2014(Daihatsu Hijet#S700) |2021 |Rear-wheel-drive (all-wheel-drive optional), mid-engined cab over kei pickup truck.
