The capital of North Carolina is Raleigh, North Carolina and the city with the most people is Charlotte, North Carolina. North Carolina is split into 100 List of counties in North Carolina, and each county has many cities and towns. North Carolina was one of the original thirteen colonies and was where the first English colony in America lived. As of 2024, there were about 10,400,000 people living in the state.List of U.S. states by population In 2018, North Carolina was number one on Forbes' Best States for Business list for the second year in a row. == History == === The Beginning === Before the English came, about 30 Native Americans groups lived in what is now known as North Carolina. In 1584, Walter Raleigh started two colonies, but they did not last long. One of these, the Roanoke Colony, later became known as the ''Lost Colony'' and is still known as one of the great unsolved mysteries of early American history to this day. Virginia Dare, the first English child born in America, was born in the Roanoke Colony. The first permanent settlers in North Carolina came from the state of Virginia in 1655 because there was not enough farmland in Virginia.Fenn and Wood, ''Natives and Newcomers'', pp. 24-25 Later the land was cut up into present-day North Carolina and South Carolina. The name "Carolina" comes from the Latin for Charles (''Carolus'') after King Charles I. The Seaborne Slave Trade of North Carolina from the ''North Carolina Historical Review'' reports that slaves brought to North Carolina before the Revolution came from the West Indies: Montego Bay, Jamaica; Barbados; Antigua; and the Bahamas; a small number from mainland colonies; and an even smaller number directly from Africa, though less than 150 slaves were imported every year between 1772 and 1775. The economy's growth and prosperity was based on slave labor. Early on, tobacco was an important source of money. === The American Revolutionary War === North Carolina was an important state during the American Revolutionary War. In April 1776, North Carolina passed the Halifax Resolves. The state was the first to vote in favor for independence from Great Britain. This act led to the United States Declaration of Independence being adopted three months later. NCpedia|url=https://www.ncpedia.org/history/usrevolution/overview|access-date=2025-06-29|website=www.ncpedia.org|language=en}} After this, North Carolina was the site of many battles in the Revolutionary War, such as the Battle of Guilford Courthouse. NCpedia|url=https://www.ncpedia.org/history/usrevolution/guilford-courthouse|access-date=2025-06-29|website=www.ncpedia.org|language=en}} Even though they were the first state to call for independence, they were one of the last to adopt the US Constitution.

NCpedia|url=https://www.ncpedia.org/government/convention-1789|access-date=2025-06-29|website=www.ncpedia.org|language=en}} === The Civil War === In 1860, North Carolina was a slave state. About 1/3 of the people in the state were slaves. North Carolina fought as part of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War, but it was the last state to leave the Union. The state sent about 125,000 troops to fight in the war and about 40,000 of them died. Even during the war some people in North Carolina did not support the Confederacy, mostly because the Confederacy believed in slavery. The people who did not support the Confederacy were called Unionists. The first Confederate soldier to be killed was from North Carolina. == Geography == File:North carolina topographic.jpg North Carolina touches South Carolina on the south, Georgia (U.S. state) on the southwest, Tennessee on the west, Virginia on the north, and the Atlantic Ocean on the east. The state is divided into three main areas of land, the Coastal Plains to the east, the Piedmont region in the middle, and the mountain ranges of Appalachian Mountains to the west. The eastern coast of the state is lined with a string of barrier islands known as Outer Banks. North Carolina is known for its changing weather across the different regions of the state. === Coastal Plain (East North Carolina) === The eastern part of the state touches the Atlantic Ocean, and usually has moderate Temperature all year long, usually not above 90°F in the summer and not under 40°F in the winter. However, it can get hotter than 100°F and as cold as 20°F. Most years there is less than one inch of snow and some years go by with no snow at all. The coastal plain usually gets a tropical storm every 3 or 4 years. === Piedmont (Middle North Carolina) === The average temperature normally does not go above 90°F in most parts of the Piedmont in summer, but can go over 100°F when there is a heat wave. Ice pellets and freezing rain are normal in this part of North Carolina, but the mountains protect the Piedmont from the worst winter weather. Snow in this region rarely lasts more than 48 hours before melting. Weak tornadoes are often seen in the Piedmont, but only 140 people have died by tornadoes from 1950 to 2012 in the entire state. === Mountains (West North Carolina) === The average temperature almost never goes above 80°F in the summer and is usually in the high 30’s or low 40’s in the winter in the mountain region of North Carolina. About 14 to 20 inches of snow fall each year with some of the higher elevations getting 50 inches each winter. The wettest part of the mountains gets 90 inches of rain. == Politics == Until recently, North Carolina mostly voted for Democrats. In presidential elections, it has voted Democratic Party (United States) twice as many times as it has voted Republican Party (United States) In presidential elections from 1968 to 2004, North Carolina supported the Democrat only in 1976, when he came from the South.
