In humans, a parent is the mother or the father figure of a child. They are either biologically or legally related to the person. When parents separate and choose who takes care of a child it is called ''child custody''. Parents who fail in their duty may be guilty of child abuse. ==Related pages== * Family * Father * Mother * Child * Grandparent * Infant attachment * Parental leave Category:Family
