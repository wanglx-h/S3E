File:Coiled rope 03235.jpg rope]] File:SuperMacro Rope.JPG A '''rope''' is made out of several threads. The material can be Organic matter, like flax, or it can be small threads of steel (in case of a steel rope, wire or cable). A rope can be used to wikt:lift, or pull things, like pulling a ship into a harbor with another ship, or fixing the ship so it does not move away. The twisting of fibers in rope is what leads to its high tensile strength (meaning it's very difficult to pull apart) and this innovation allowed the rope to become a construction staple that has been used for millennia. Ropes have been used for thousands of years, from the Egyptians using them in 4000BCE and modern-day construction that relies heavily on the strength of this tool. ==Gallery== File:Tågvirke - Ystad-2016.jpg|Fishermen measure lengths of rope in Ystad 2016.
