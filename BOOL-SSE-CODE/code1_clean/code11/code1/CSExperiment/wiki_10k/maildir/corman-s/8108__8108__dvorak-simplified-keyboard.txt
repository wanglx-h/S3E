Subject: Dvorak Simplified Keyboard
File:KB United States Dvorak.svg The '''Dvorak Simplified Keyboard '''( ) is an alternative way of putting letters on an english language Keyboard (computer). Most English keyboards have the keys lined up in a "QWERTY layout." The point of QWERTY was to prevent typewriter keys from sticking, but it is not the most "ergonomic", or comfortable, keyboard to type on. August Dvorak invented the Dvorak keyboard, where letters are arranged based on how often they are used. For instance, the most common letters (like "e") are in the center row of keys, so less hand movement is needed when a person is typing. Proponents of the Dvorak keyboard feel that with the use of computers rather than typewriters, there is no reason to keep the QWERTY keyboard. Many Dvorak keyboard users think that more people should use the Dvorak keyboard, as it aims to prevent typing injuries (like repetitive strain injury and carpal tunnel syndrome). But most users are used to the QWERTY keyboard, and do not want to switch.Liebowitz, Stan J. & Stephen E. Margolis 1990. The fable of the keys. ''Journal of Law & Economics''. '''33''' (1): 1–25. doi:10.1086/467198. Retrieved 2007-09-19. "We show that David's version of the history of the market's rejection of Dvorak does not report the true history, and we present evidence that the continued use of Qwerty is efficient given the current understanding of keyboard design". ; also Brooks, Marcus W. 1999.
