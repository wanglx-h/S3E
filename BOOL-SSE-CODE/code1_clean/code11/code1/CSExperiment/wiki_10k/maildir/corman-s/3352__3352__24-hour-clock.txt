It does not use a.m. or p.m. This system is also referred to (only in the United States and the English language parts of Canada) as '''military time''' or (only in the United Kingdom and now very rarely) as '''continental time'''. In some parts of the world, it is called '''railway time'''. Also, the international standard notation of time (ISO 8601) is based on this format. ==Particulars== A time in the 24-hour clock is written in the form hours:minutes (for example, 01:23), or Hour:Minute:Second (01:23:45). Numbers under 10 have a zero in front (called a leading zero); e.g. 09:07. Under the 24-hour clock system, the day begins at midnight, 24:00, and the last minute of the day begins at 23:59 and ends at 24:00, which is identical to 24:00 of the following day. 12:00 can only be noon – midday. Midnight is called 24:00 and used to mean the end of the day. It is also used to mean the beginning of the day. For example, you would say "Tuesday at 24:00" and "Wednesday at 24:00" to mean exactly the same time. Advantages over the 12-hour clock system: * Fewer confusions between morning and evening; e.g. 7 o'clock in the evening is called 19:00. * People do not have to figure out if noon is 00h00, 24h or 12h to calculate duration. ==Applications== ===Regional=== In many Africa, Asia, Europe and Latin America countries people use it to write the time. Many people use it in speaking. Many digital wristwatches and clocks can display the time of day using the 24-hour clock. ===Military=== The Military of the United States prefers not to say 24:00 - they do not like to have two names for the same thing, so they always say "23:59", which is one minute before midnight.File:Galvano-Magnetic 24 Hour Clock, Royal Observatory, Greenwich - geograph.org.uk - 663062.jpg 24-hour clock time is used in computers, by the Military, for public safety, and in transport. ===Railway=== In railway Timetable 24:00 means the ''end'' of the day. For example, a train due to arrive at a Railway station during the last minute of a day arrives at 24:00; but trains which depart during the first minute of the day go at 24:00. To write shop opening hours until midnight use, for example, "24:00–24:00", "07:00–24:00". ==Related pages== *Time *Clock *Space (physics) *Physics *Spacetime *Kinematics *Radioactivity *Albert Einstein *Atomic physics *General Relativity *Erwin Schrödinger *Classical mechanics *Quantum mechanics *Unit of Measurement *International System of Units (SI units) ==References== Category:Time Category:Clocks
