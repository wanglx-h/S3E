Image:Sputnik asm.jpg]] The '''Sputnik programme''' was a Soviet Union spacecraft programme. Sputnik 1, the first satellite in the programme, was launched on October 4, 1957. This was the first man-made satellite ever to enter orbit. The United States was very surprised when the Soviet Union sent Sputnik 1 into Outer space. It did not want to fall behind.

This was when the Space Race between the Soviet Union and the United States began. == Etymology == The word ''Sputnik'' comes from the , or , not . ==References== == Other websites == * [http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/Sputnik Sputnik], Citizendium Category:Soviet satellites Category:1950s in the Soviet Union Category:1950s in spaceflight
