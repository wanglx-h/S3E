File:Geometrie_carre.png File:01-Quadrat-Diagonale-gegeben.gif A '''square''' is a shape with four equal sides and four corners that are all right angles (90 degrees). The diagonals of a square also cross at right angles. The angle between any diagonal and a side of a square is 45 degrees. A square has rotational symmetry of four. It has four lines of regular symmetry. A square with vertices ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' and ''D'' can be written as \square ABCD. A square is a type of rectangle with all sides of equal length. However, while a square is a type of rectangle and rhombus, the opposite does not need to be true. A square is also the 2-dimensional surface of a cube. == Formulas == If the length of side ''a'' is known, then we have that: {| class="wikitable" |+ |Perimeter |4a |- |Area |a^2 |- |Length of diagonal |\sqrt{2}a |} If the length of diagonal ''d'' is known, then we have that: {| class="wikitable" |+ |Length of side |\frac{d}{\sqrt{2}} |- |Perimeter |2d\sqrt{2} |- |Area |\frac{d^2}{2} |} == Related pages == * Square (algebra) * Square number * Square root ==References== Category:Polygons Category:Basic English 850 words
