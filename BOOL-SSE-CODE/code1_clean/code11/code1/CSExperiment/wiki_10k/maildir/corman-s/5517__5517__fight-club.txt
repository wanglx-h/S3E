'''''Fight Club''''' is a 1999 American drama movie. It stars Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham Carter. The movie was movie director by David Fincher. It is based on a novel of the Fight Club (book) by Chuck Palahniuk. The story is about an unnamed The Narrator (Fight Club)'s path during a dark form of personal enlightenment (or eternal happiness) which is achieved primarily through fighting. The story is dark and, in both the book and the movie, contains strong depictions of violence. There are a large number of metaphors which are revealed in its complex and twisted storyline. Some would think that the morals and life guidelines taught in the story would be an extreme form of Buddhism, such as the idea of detachment from material possessions (things). The protagonist has dissociative identity disorder. == Cast == * Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden * Edward Norton as the Narrator * Helena Bonham Carter as Marla Singer * Meat Loaf as Robert Paulson * Jared Leto as Angel Face == Other websites == * *[https://wallpapertag.com/fight-club-wallpaper Fight club wallpapers] Category:1999 drama movies Category:1990s satirical movies Category:American drama movies Category:American satirical movies Category:Cult movies Category:Dissociative identity disorder in movies Category:English-language movies Category:Movies about terrorism Category:Movies based on books Category:Movies directed by David Fincher Category:20th Century Fox movies
