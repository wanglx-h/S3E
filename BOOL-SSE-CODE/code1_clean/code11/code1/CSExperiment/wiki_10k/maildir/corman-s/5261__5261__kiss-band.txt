Their more famous era was in the mid-1970s, particularly the first 6 studio albums, and the first live album, Alive! which was widely popular. In the 1980s, Kiss started to follow the trend taking place with more synthesizers, and songs that many fans didn't like because of a big change in style. In the 1990s, Kiss changed toward the grunge and heavier trend with Revenge and Carnival of Souls: The Final Sessions. The original members reunited for Psycho Circus and then parted ways again in 2002. Tommy Thayer and Eric Singer replaced Frehley and Criss, and the current lineup has made the 2009 album Sonic Boom, which was a return to the classic style of the 70's, and many fans liked it. The follow up to Sonic Boom was released in June 2012, titled Monster. * ''Kiss (album)'' * ''Hotter Than Hell'' * ''Dressed to Kill'' * ''Alive!'' * ''Destroyer (album)'' * ''Rock and Roll Over'' * ''Love Gun'' * ''Alive II'' * ''Gene Simmons (album)'' * ''Paul Stanley (album)'' * ''Ace Frehley (album)'' * ''Peter Criss (album)'' * ''Dynasty (album)'' * ''Unmasked'' * ''Music from "The Elder"'' * ''Creatures of the Night'' * ''Lick It Up'' * ''Animalize'' * ''Asylum (album)'' * ''Crazy Nights'' * ''Hot in the Shade'' * ''Revenge (album)'' * ''Alive III'' * ''Kiss Unplugged'' * ''Carnival of Souls: The Final Sessions'' * ''Psycho Circus'' * ''Kiss Symphony: Alive IV'' * ''Sonic Boom'' * ''Monster (album)'' == Other websites == * [http://www.kissonline.com Kiss Online] * [http://www.kissweb-it.com/strike Kiss Army] * [http://www.kissdressedtoplay.com Kiss Dressed to Play - Brazilian Page] Category:1973 establishments in New York (state) Category:1970s American music groups Category:1980s American music groups Category:1990s American music groups Category:2000s American music groups Category:2010s American music groups Category:Musical groups established in 1973 Category:Musical groups from New York City Category:Kiss (band)
