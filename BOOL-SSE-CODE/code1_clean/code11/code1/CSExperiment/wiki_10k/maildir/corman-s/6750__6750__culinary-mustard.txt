File:Bread with mustard.JPG '''Culinary mustard''' is a condiment people use when making food. It comes from the seeds of the mustard plant. == Preparation == Mustard is prepared by grinding the seeds of the Mustard plant, and mixing them with water or vinegar. Depending on which seeds are taken, and/or how much vinegar is added, the mustard may turn out hotter or less hot. == Use == Most mustard is made available as a bottled condiment and can be spread on a slice of sandwich bread, salad, vegetables, meat or squirted onto a hotdog or a potato salad, along with ketchup, horseradish and other spices. It is often found in fast-food restaurants in the form of a small packet which the diner may open and squeeze into the dish of choice. ==Related pages== * Condiment * Ketchup * Spice Category:Condiments
