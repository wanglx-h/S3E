They did not want black people who were not Slavery in the United States to be in the United States. Because of this, they took some of them to Liberia. At the start of the American Civil War (in the 1860s) about 12,000 freed slaves lived in Liberia. The name of the country means "Land of the Free" in Latin. Liberia gained its independence on July 26, 1847. Joseph Jenkins Roberts was the first president of Liberia. Europe countries were quick to recognize Liberia as a country. The United States did not recognize it as a country until 1862. Many of the black people who were sent to Liberia were Missionary. Its official language today is English language . In the 1990s and in the early 2000s, two Liberia civil wars badly affected the country. The country's constitution is similar to that of the United States. In the 2017 elections, George Weah became the twenty-fifth President of Liberia.
