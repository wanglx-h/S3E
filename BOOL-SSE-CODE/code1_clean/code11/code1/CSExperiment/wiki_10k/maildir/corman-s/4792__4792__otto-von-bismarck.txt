As Prime Minister of Prussia from 1862 to 1890, he was most responsible for the uniting most of the many independent Germany countries into the new German Empire in 1871 and became its first chancellor until 1890. He was ''Graf von Bismarck-Schönhausen'' (Count Bismarck-Schönhausen) in 1865. In 1871, he was ''Fürst'' von Bismarck (Prince Bismarck). In 1890, he became the ''Herzog von Lauenburg'' (Duke of Lauenburg). At first, he did not want to become a duke, but he accepted the title later. == Unification of Germany == In the 1860s, he engineered a series of wars that lasted until 1871 and Unification of Germany except Austria into the new German Empire, which was led by Prussia. He "remained undisputed world champion at the game of multilateral diplomatic chess for almost twenty years after 1871, [and] devoted himself exclusively, and successfully, to maintaining peace between the powers".Eric Hobsbawm, ''The Age of Empire: 1875–1914'' (1987), p. 312. Bismarck conducted wars against Denmark (1864), Austria (1866) and France (1871) to make Prussia more powerful. The Franco-Prussian War was very significant in the long run. France lost AlsaceLorraine during the German victory, which was led by the brilliant Helmuth von Moltke. The war also made Germany the most important country in Central Europe. After the death of Kaiser Wilhelm I of Germany and that of his son, Frederick III, German Emperor, who briefly replaced him in 1888, a new era began without Bismarck and Moltke, with Wilhelm II now on the throne. == Policy at home == Bismarck was very conservative, strongly connected to the monarchy and opposed to democracy. His most important goal was to make Prussia stronger, which he did by unifying Germany. Bismarck tried to stop the rise of socialism and to reduce the power of the Catholic Church. One way to stop socialism was to make the working class happy. Bismarck did so by introducing many social reforms like public Health insurance and accident insurance, as well as pensions for old people. His 's pension scheme was the forerunner of the modern welfare state in Germany, and many other countries started similar systems.Steinberg, Jonathan. 2011.
