File:File-Eros - Pompeiian statue - Naples Archeological Museum.jpg '''Eros''' is the god of love, lust, and sexual intercourse in Greek mythology. According to Hesiod's ''Theogony'', Eros came from the Chaos (mythology). Later it was said that he was the son of Ares and Aphrodite. His lover is Psyche (mythology). Eros has a bow (weapon) and golden arrows with whom he can shoot at people so they will fall in love, but he has also leaden arrows which make people hate others. There is a famous statue which many people think is to Eros, but is actually to Anteros in London in Piccadilly Circus. From the name Eros we get the word '''erotic''', meaning: to do with sexual love (passionate and physical). There is also a noun: '''eroticism'''. Eros is the son of Aphrodite. Eros' main myth is: "the myth of Eros and Psyche" in which Eros and Psyche fall in love after psyche is put through tasks by Aphrodite. ==Related pages== * Cupid, the version of Eros in Roman mythology *433 Eros Category:Greek gods and goddesses Category:Gods and goddesses of love and lust
