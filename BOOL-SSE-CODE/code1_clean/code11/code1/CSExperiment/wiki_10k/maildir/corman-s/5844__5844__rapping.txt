Subject: Rapping
'''Rapping''' is a type of Singer, like singing. It is different to singing because it is more like Speech, but timed with rhythm over music. Someone who raps is called a '''rapper''', or sometimes an '''MC'''. That stands for Master of Ceremonies. Rapping can be done over music of many types (or Musical genre), including jazz, House music, reggae and many more. One genre of music that includes a lot of rapping is hip hop. What people think of as rapping today, was started by African Americans in New York City, United States, in the 1970s. People would talk over Disco Disc jockeys at parties, and this gradually evolved into rapping. But, the start of the art of rapping is even older. Reggae artists in Jamaica used a similar style to rapping from the 1950s. Going back further than that, the West Africa Griots (travelling Musician and poets) would also rap over tribal drums in the 1400s.

It typically consists of two main components: rhythmic spoken words, known as "rapping" or "MCing," and musical accompaniment, often built on "beatboxing," "DJing" with turntablism and sampling, or the use of electronic instruments. Terminology The term "hip hop" is often used to refer to the entire cultural movement, while "rap" refers specifically to the musical element. However, in common usage, the terms are frequently used interchangeably to describe the music. ==History== Early Years 1970 Hip hop music originated in street parties in the Bronx boroughs of New York City, particularly among African American and Latino youth. DJ Kool Herc is widely credited as a pioneer, focusing on the instrumental "breaks" of funk and soul records and using dual turntable techniques (turntablism) to extend these danceable sections. Soon, MCs (Masters of Ceremonies) began to speak or chant over these beats, offering greetings to the audience, telling stories, or issuing challenges. Golden Age 1980 The 1980s saw an explosion in the popularity of hip hop music, with the emergence of influential artists like Run-DMC, the Beastie Boys, and Public Enemy. Lyrical themes expanded to include social and political commentary, personal struggles, and celebrations of urban culture. Production techniques also evolved, with the increased use of drum machines and samplers becoming common. 1990s and Beyond Hip hop music continued to diversify and evolve throughout the 1990s and subsequent decades. Various subgenres emerged, such as gangsta rap, jazz rap, and alternative hip hop. Hip hop spread globally, influencing numerous musical cultures worldwide and spawning local artists and music on every continent. Today, hip hop music remains one of the most popular and influential music genres globally, continuously evolving and innovating. ==Core Elements of Hip Hop Music== * Rapping (MCing): The rhythmic spoken delivery of rhymes, often incorporating wordplay, alliteration, storytelling, and intricate lyrical patterns. * DJing and Turntablism: The use of turntables to create beats, sound effects, and samples from existing recordings. * Beatboxing: The art of producing drum beats, rhythms, and musical sounds using one's mouth, lips, tongue, and voice. * Sampling: The practice of incorporating portions of existing audio recordings (such as drum loops, basslines, or melodic fragments) as the foundation for a new musical piece. * Graffiti: While not a direct musical element, it's an integral part of hip hop's visual culture. * Breakdancing (B-boying/B-girling): A dynamic form of street dance that developed alongside hip hop music. ==Cultural Impact== Hip hop music has had a profound impact on popular culture worldwide.
