It included all of France except for Alsace-Lorraine and Pas-de-Calais. It also governed the French colonial empire. The state was led by Philippe Pétain. He had been notable for helping to win World War I. The '''Vichy French Military''' took place from July 1940 to September 1944. ==History== When the French and the British Army lost the Battle of Dunkirk, and the rest of the Battle of France was being lost, the French Parliament made Pétain Prime Minister. He negotiated an armistice with Germany. He agreed that France would be Neutrality (international relations) in World War II. He became head of state and ruled as a dictator. He usually did what the Germans told him to do. The Axis powers military occupation northern and western France. They also controlled part of the southeastern part of the country. The Vichy government, as a client state of Germany, controlled the Free Zone, the unoccupied parts of France. In November 1942 the United States joined the North African Campaign by invading French North Africa, so the German army occupied the Vichy zone. In 1943, the Vichy government, now a puppet state, moved to Paris. In 1944, it moved to Germany. The government disbanded in 1945 with the defeat of Nazi Germany.
