The '''Bali tiger''' (''Panthera tigris balica''), or '''Balinese tiger''' (Balinese language: ᬩᬗᬸᬦᬘᬦ᭄, ''Macán Bali''; also know as '''Sang mong''') is one of the three extinction subspecies of the tiger. They became extinct in 1937. They lived on Bali. This was the first subspecies of tiger to become extinct. The Bali was also the smallest tiger subspecies. There is no record of a Balinese tiger ever being held in a zoo collection. The Balinese tiger's close subspecies were the Javan tiger and the Caspian tiger, which are now also extinct. The Balinese and Javan tigers were once the same, but during the Ice Age, Bali became isolated from Java by the Bali Strait. This split the tigers into two groups which then developed separately. The killing of the very last wild Balinese tiger is usually thought to have been at Sumbar Kima, West Bali on 27 September 1937. It was an adult female. So the government of Bali made a strict law on killing tigers, but by then it was too late, because the Bali tiger had already become extinct. == Other websites == Category:Tigers Category:Extinct mammals
