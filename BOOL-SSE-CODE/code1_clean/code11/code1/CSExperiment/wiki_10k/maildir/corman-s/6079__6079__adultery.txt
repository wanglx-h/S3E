File:Jules Arsène Garnier - Le supplice des adultères.jpg shows an adulterous couple being punished]] '''Adultery''' (informally known as '''cheating''' in non-religious situations) is a word used in religion texts like Exodus 20:14. Adultery applies to a married person sexual intercourse someone other than the person who they are married to. In countries where religion is important, adultery often comes with a heavy punishment. Some Muslim countries punish it with death by stoning. In most countries adultery is no longer a crime, but most people still see it as a bad thing.(see Gospel of John 8) If a person who is married takes part in adultery, that person's husband or wife would usually have the right to be able to go to court to divorce them. == Word origin == The word adultery originates not from “adult”, as is commonly thought in English-speaking countries, but from the Late Latin word for “to alter, corrupt”: “adulterare”. “Adulterare” in turn is formed by the combination of “ad” (towards), and “alter” (other), together with the infinitive form “are” (making it a verb). Thus the meaning is literally “to make other”. In contrast, the word “adult” (meaning a person of mature years) comes from another Latin root, “adolescere”, meaning to grow up or mature: a combination of “ad” (towards), “alere” (to nourish, to grow), and the inchoative infix “sc”(meaning to enter into a state of). == Literature == Famous adulterers include : * Paris (mythology) and Helen in the Iliad * Lancelot and King Arthur * David and Bathsheba the wife of Uriah (2 Samuel 11) * Anna Karenina and Vronsky * Madame Bovary by Gustave Flaubert * The Tale of Genji * The Scarlet Letter * Othello == Related pages == * Infidelity: the same concept, but without a religious background Category:Adultery Category:Love
