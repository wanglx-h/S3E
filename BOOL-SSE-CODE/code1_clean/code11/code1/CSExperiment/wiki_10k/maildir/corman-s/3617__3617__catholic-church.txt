It has over 1,000,000,000 members, and is the world's largest Religion group..Sandra Brenneman Oldendorf 2011. ''Religious diversity and children's literature: strategies and resources'', p 156. Its members believe that Jesus started the Catholic Church 2,000 years ago. The Church’s headquarters are in the Vatican City, a sovereign state governed by the Holy See that is an enclave of Rome, Italy.[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/27/opinion/global/which-catholic-church.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0 Which Catholic Church?] The word "catholic" comes from the Greek language word καθολικός (''katholikós''), which means "universal." This word was first used in the Nicene Creed. Often, the word "Roman" is added before “Catholic” because Vatican City is a country inside of Rome, Italy. Members of the Catholic Church call themselves ''Catholics''. Almost half of all Catholics are in Latin America. The continent with the second-largest number of Catholics is Europe. Millions of Catholics live in other places all over the world. The Catholic Church is led by the Pope, the Bishop of Rome, who lives in the Vatican City. According to Catholics, the Church is guided by the Holy Spirit, who also guides the Pope. The Church teaches that the Pope cannot be wrong when he speaks officially on the subject of Catholic faith and Morality. This is called "infallibility," and Popes have used it throughout history, but very rarely. Examples include the Tome of Pope Leo I, the declaration of the Immaculate Conception, and various anathemas (religious condemnations issued by the Popes against certain heresy). The Catholic Church teaches that the first Pope was Saint Peter, who was a Disciple (Christianity) of Jesus Christ. == History == The Catholic Church is one of the oldest religious institutions in the world. It began about 2,000 years ago when Jesus Christ lived and taught in what is now Israel and Palestine. Jesus' followers, known as disciples, believed he was the Son of God. After Jesus died and was resurrected, his disciples spread his teachings. One of them, Saint Peter, became the first leader of the Church. Catholics believe Peter was the first Pope, and his successors have led the Church ever since. In the early years, Christianity was a small group within the Roman Empire. Many Christians faced persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire (harsh treatment) because the Roman rulers saw them as a threat. But in 313 AD, Emperor Constantine the Great made Christianity legal with the Edict of Milan, and later, it became the empire's main religion. Over time, the Church grew strong and spread across Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. During the Middle Ages, the Catholic Church was the most powerful institution in Europe. It influenced kings, built large cathedrals, and preserved knowledge through monasteries. However, in the 1500s, a movement called the Protestant Reformation led to a split in Christianity. Many people left the Catholic Church to form new Christian groups, like Lutheranism and Anglicanism. The Church responded with its own reforms, known as the Counter-Reformation, strengthening its teachings and traditions. The Roman Church has the oldest continuously used legal system in the world.Dr. Edward N. Peters, [http://www.canonlaw.info CanonLaw.info], accessed Jul-1-2013Raymond Wacks, ''Law: A Very Short Introduction, 2nd Ed.'' (Oxford University Press, 2015) p.15. In modern times, the Catholic Church continues to be a major religious and cultural force. It has over Catholic Church by country. The Church runs schools, hospitals and charities and has played an important role in promoting peace and human rights. Today, the Pope, who lives in Vatican City, leads the Church and works to guide Catholics in their faith. == Faith and morals == Like other Christians, Catholics believe Jesus is Deity: the Son of God. They believe that because he loved all people, he died so that all will live forever in heaven. Catholics believe in the Trinity: that the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit are together the only God. == The Pope == The leader of the Roman Catholic Church is called the Pope, which literally means "father". Catholics say Jesus Christ established the Catholic Church and appointed the first Pope, a disciple of his named Saint Peter, to lead all Christians. Over the last 2,000 years, different Popes have led the church. The most recent Pope is the 267th and is called Pope Leo XIV. In modern times, Popes live in the Vatican City, a very small country inside the city of Rome, Italy. === Regnal names === For centuries, Popes have used regnal names instead of birth names. (The current Pope, Leo, was born Robert Prevost.) This custom started in the 6th century when a man named Mercury was elected Pope. Mercury (mythology) was the name of a Paganism god, which seemed inappropriate for a Pope. Instead Mercury took the name John II in honor of the previous Pope, John I. In the 10th century it became customary for Popes to use regnal names. Since the death of Marcellus II in 1555, every Pope has taken a Papal name. File:Catholic mass in Bosnia, illustration, 1901.jpg === Leadership roles === The Catholic Church is made of 23 "particular churches", otherwise known as rites. The Pope is the head of the Latin Rite of the church (which is the largest with over 1 billion members). He is also the leader of 22 Eastern Catholic Churches. These Eastern churches follow the Orthodox Christianity. Many have broken away from their Orthodox mother churches to join the Pope and submit to his authority as successor of Saint Peter. The Eastern Catholic Churches are based all over the world, from the United States to the Middle East to India. Like other churches, the Catholic Church also leads Christian missions throughout the world. === Infallibility === The exercise of infallibility takes several forms (see ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', no. 890-891, citing ''Lumen Gentium'', 25). One form is exercised by the Pope when speaking ''ex cathedra'' (literally, “from the chair” of St. Peter, in his authority as pope) on matters of faith or morals, even if he does so without the support of the bishops. This is an exercise of the Extraordinary Magisterium of the Church. While the pope has always held the power to exercise the Extraordinary Magisterium by speaking ''ex cathedra'', the actual occurrence of an ''ex cathedra'' statement is quite rare. It is generally understood to have only occurred twice: Pope Pius IX’s definition of the dogma of Mary’s Immaculate Conception in 1854 and Pope Pius XII’s definition of the dogma of Mary’s Assumption in 1950. In both of these cases, the Pope was not teaching something new. Rather, he was confirming and clarifying something that the Church had already believed as part of God’s revelation. ==Worship practices== File:Eucharist at St. Mary's Church, Meenangadi.jpg at St. Mary's Church, Meenangadi]] Some of the traditional practices of Roman Catholics carried out each time they pray at home or at Church include making the sign of the cross, kneeling, and bowing. Their main ceremony is the Mass (liturgy). Catholics are normally required to go to a Mass on Sundays and on Holy Days of Obligation. In the United States, the Holy Days of Obligation are: Mary, Mother of God (January 1), The Assumption of Mary (August 15), The Immaculate Conception (of Mary) (December 8), The Ascension of Jesus (40 days after Easter), Christmas (December 25) and All Saints Day (November 1). The taking of the Eucharist is the height of the Mass. Catholics worship Jesus. They also venerate the Virgin Mary more than other Christians, calling her the "Mother of God," based on Elizabeth's greeting, "And why is this granted me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?" and also on the belief that all Christians hold that Jesus is fully man and fully God at the same time. Yet, Mary, who has nothing to do with the Divine, was chosen as the human vessel God would use to enter into the world. It is important to note that Catholics do not worship Mary. Instead, they honor her as one honors a Queen. This type of honor is called hyperdulia. An important Catholic prayer is the Rosary. This prayer is done with Rosary beads used to count each prayer. The Rosary is made up of five decades, each decade being made up of 1 Our Father, 10 Hail Marys, and 1 Gloria Patri, as well as saying the Sacred Mysteries. It is made up of passages taken from scripture. It is recommended by the clergy to continue the very old practice of praying the Rosary daily, as it has not only many powerful requests but is made up of words taken directly from scripture, like the Lord's Prayer (Our Father) and the Hail Mary. The Rosary is not complete unless one thinks about the passion of Christ while praying out loud. In addition, the clergy (bishops, priests, and deacons) must pray the Divine Office. ==Sacraments== File:Catholic Mass, Operation Napoleon-Saline, May 1968 (16021988949).jpg receive the Eucharist during the Vietnam War]] The Catholic Church celebrates seven sacraments. A sacrament is "an outward sign instituted (started) by Christ to give grace" (a supernatural gift of God that someone did nothing to deserve). The seven sacraments are: Baptism, Confirmation (Christianity), Eucharist, Reconciliation, Anointing of the Sick, Holy Orders and Holy Matrimony (marriage). The Holy Eucharist is the most important of the sacraments, because Catholics believe that Jesus Christ becomes truly present in the form of bread and wine. This happens through transubstantiation which takes place in the Mass. Catholics believe in the necessity of love, hope and faith in order to gain salvation, but that these all come from grace. This is different from the 16th century interpretation created by Luther. Catholics interpret the Bible (God-given book) according to Tradition. Tradition is the transmission of the early church's life and teaching, as especially recorded in the writings of the Fathers of the Church who lived in the first centuries. At that time the holy books where accepted in the Bible, which is the collection of the books considered revealed. A basic rule for Catholics is that "Truth cannot contradict truth". They translate the Bible with this in mind. No interpretation can be accepted if it contradicts another revealed truth. ==Nicene Creed== File:Rafael - ressureicaocristo01.jpg'' (painted by Raphael some time between 1499-1502)]] Catholics, like many Christians, accept the Nicene Creed, a combination of the First Council of Nicaea (AD 325) and the later Council of Constantinople (AD 382) as true. It is as follows:[http://www.ecatholic2000.com/pray/prayer7.shtml Nicene Creed, Catholic Prayers] ''I believe in one God, God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, of all things visible and invisible. I believe in one Lord Jesus, the only-begotten Son of God, born of the Father before all ages, God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, wikt:consubstantial with the Father. Through Him all things were made. For us men and our Salvation (Christianity) He came down from heaven: and, by the Holy Spirit in Christianity, was Incarnation (Christianity) of the Mary (mother of Jesus), and became man. For our sake, He was Crucifixion of Jesus under Pontius Pilate; He suffered death and was buried and Resurrection of Jesus on the third day in accordance with Gospel: He Ascension of Jesus and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will come again in glory to Day of judgment, and Heaven will have no end. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father and the Son, Who, with the Father and the Son, is adored and glorified, Who has spoken through the Prophets. I believe in Christian Church#Terminology Church. I confess one baptism for the forgiveness of sins and I look forward to the resurrection of the dead, and the Afterlife. Amen.'' Eastern Orthodox Church and Protestantism believe many of the same things. They sometime disagree on the role of Virgin Mary and other Canonization, on what a priest can do, and on how exactly God should be worshipped, among other things. ==Related pages== * Inquisition * Anglicanism * Protestantism * Supersessionism * East-West Schism * Eastern Christianity * Protestant Reformation * European wars of religion ==References== ==Other websites== * [https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/the-catholic-church The Catholic Church] * [https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/scottish-journal-of-theology/article/abs/our-lady-reconsidered-john-knox-and-the-virgin-mary/D261C972F361CB7E24AE956D120F6F60 Our Lady reconsidered: John Knox and the Virgin Mary] Category:Asian culture Category:Italian culture Category:European culture Category:Religion in Poland Category:History Category:Religion Category:Catholicism Category:Christianity in the United States
