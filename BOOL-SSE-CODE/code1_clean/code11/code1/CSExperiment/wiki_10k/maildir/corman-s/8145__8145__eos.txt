'''Eos''' (Ancient Greek and Homeric Greek: Ἠώς, ''Ēōs''; Attic Greek: Ἕως, ''Éōs''; Aeolic Greek: Αὔως, ''Aúōs''; Doric Greek: Ἀώς, ''Āṓs'') is the goddess of the dawn in Greek mythology. She was the daughter of the Titan (mythology) Hyperion (Titan) and Theia. She is the sister of Helios, god of the sun, and Selene, goddess of the moon. == Myth == Eos leaves her home, which was at the edge of ocean, every morning to wake her brother, Helios. She opens the gates of heaven so that Helios can ride his chariot across the sky each day. ==Related pages== * Aurora - Roman mythology version of Eos. * Thesan - Etruscan mythology version of Eos.
