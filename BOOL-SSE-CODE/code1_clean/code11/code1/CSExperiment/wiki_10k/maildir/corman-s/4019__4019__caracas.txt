Santiago de Leòn de Losada founded by Diego de Losada in 1567. It is where Simon Bolivar was born. The city has nearly 6 million people, who live in the metropolitan area. Caracas is the center of the economical activity of the country and also hosts the main government offices of Venezuela. After WW2 the city has experienced a huge growth, thanks to the oil revenues of the country. Nearly half a million Europeans immigrated to the city in the 1950s ( that had in those years only one million inhabitants) and so Caracas developed a typical western-European look in the new modern areas. == Geography == File:Parque del Este - Caracas.JPG]] Caracas is contained entirely within a valley of the Cordillera de la Costa Central, and is separated from the Caribbean coast by a roughly expanse of El Ávila National Park. The valley is relatively small and quite irregular, and the altitude varies from between above sea level; the historic center lies at about above sea level. This, along with the rapid population growth, has profoundly influenced the urban planning of the city. The most elevated point of the Capital District, wherein the city is located, is the ''Pico El Ávila'', which rises to . The main body of water in Caracas is the Guaire River, which flows across the city and empties into the Tuy River, which is also fed by the El Valle and San Pedro de los Altos rivers, in addition to numerous streams which descend from El Ávila. The La Mariposa and reservoirs provide water to the city. The city is occasionally subject to earthquakes – notably in 1641 Caracas earthquake and 1967. Geologically, Caracas was formed in the Late Cretaceous period, with much of the rest of the Caribbean, and sits on what is mostly metamorphic rock. Deformation of the land in this period formed the region. == Climate == Caracas has a tropical climate (Köppen climate classification: ''Aw''); fresh due to the elevation and with two distinct seasons: the rainy season, and the dry season. ==Sports== All the best teams of the sports done in Venezuela are concentrated in the metropolitan area of Caracas. Between those teams we have: * baseball: Leones de Caracas * football: Deportivo Italia (1948-2010); Deportivo Petare; Caracas FC. == Famous sites == * Avila National Park * Humbolt Tramway * Simon Bolivar Birthplace * Caracas Cathedral * Bolivar Square * Altamira Square * East Park * Los Proceres * Parque Central * Centro Comercial Tamanaco * Sambil Mall ==Buildings== Many beautiful modern buildings can be seen in the city.
