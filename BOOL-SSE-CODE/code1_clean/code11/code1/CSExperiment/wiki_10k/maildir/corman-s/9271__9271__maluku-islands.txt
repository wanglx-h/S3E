File:Maluku Locator Topography.png The '''Maluku Islands''' (also called the '''Moluccas''', '''Moluccan Islands''' or simply '''Maluku''') are an archipelago in Indonesia. They are part of the larger Malay Archipelago. They are on the Australian Plate, lying east of Sulawesi (Celebes), west of New Guinea, and north of Timor. The islands were also called the "Spice Islands" by the China and Europeans. Other islands have also been called the Spice Islands.

It includes rainforests, sago, rice, and the famous spices; including nutmeg, cloves, and mace. Though originally Melanesian, the people of many island clans, especially in the Banda Islands, died in the 17th century. A second group of Malay people people arrived in the early 20th century under the Netherlands and this has continued in the Indonesian era. Politically, the Maluku Islands formed a single province of Indonesia from 1950 until 1999. In 1999 the North Maluku (''Maluku Utara'') and Halmahera Tengah (Central Halmahera) regencies (Indonesia) were split off as a separate province. The islands are now divided between two Provinces of Indonesia, Maluku (province) and North Maluku. Most of the people of these islands follow Islam. There is also a Christian minority because of Western European Christian Protestant Missionary in this region. Between 1999 and 2002 there was deadly fighting between the Muslim population and the Christians. Both groups had been peaceful before. The capital of North Maluku island is Ternate.
