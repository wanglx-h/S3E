'''1579''' (Roman numerals) was a common year starting on Thursday in the Julian calendar. == Events == *January 6 – The Union of Atrecht united the southern Spanish Netherlands under the Alessandro Farnese, Duke of Parma and Piacenza, governor in the name of king Philip II of Spain. *January 23 – The Union of Utrecht united the northern Netherlands in a confederation called the Dutch Republic. William I of Orange becomes Stadtholder, and the François, Duke of Anjou, younger brother of Henry III of France is invited to become hereditary sovereign. * March – Capture of Maastricht by the Spanish under Parma. * June 17 – Sir Francis Drake, during his circumnavigation of the world, lands in what is now California, which he claims for Elizabeth I of England. With an England claim here and in Newfoundland, it becomes the basis for English colonial charters which will claim all land from the Atlantic to the Pacific, from "sea to sea." Drake's claim is called "Nova Albion" (meaning, ''New England''), and subsequent maps will show all lands north of New Spain and New Mexico under this name. Category:1579
