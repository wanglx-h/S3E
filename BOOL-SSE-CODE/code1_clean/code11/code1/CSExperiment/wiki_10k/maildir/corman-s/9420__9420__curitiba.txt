It has the largest population and economy in the Southern Brazil. It is one of the most important cities of Brazil's southern region. More than 1,800,000 people live in it. It covers an area of 430.9 km². It is the 7th largest Brazilian city and 4th largest in the Southern Cone (the south part of South America). The urban area of Curitiba is looked after by 26 municipality and has 3,335,588 people living there. == History == Curitiba started in 1693 as a small village. It became an important trading stop because a road was opened. The road joined the southeast area to Southern Brazil. In 1853, it became the capital of the newly made province of Paraná. Since then, the city has seen a lot of urban growth. During the 19th century, many European people arrived, including Germany, Poland, Ukraine and Italy. They added to the cultural mix that still is there. The city made plans and laws to slow the growth of the city and that led to the city being famous for its new ideas and connection to the environment. Most of the new ideas had to do with the public transport system. == Present == Today, the city has a sense of cosmopolitan life and is said to be the safest city in Brazil. It is the Brazilian capital with the best quality of life and is a diversity wikt:industrial center that makes Curitiba the 4th largest economy in Brazil; the largest in the southern region. The city is said to be one of the five best cities to invest in Latin America and the 49th city with the greatest influence in the world. Large companies have moved their headquarters to the city because of Curitiba's structure and easy access. Its international airport, the Afonso Pena International Airport, serves the whole southern region of Brazil. It has access to the Harbour of Paranaguá, and the junction of highways and railroads link the south region directly to the southeast part of the country. Many Multinational corporation automobile (car) companies are in Greater Curitiba, which makes Curitiba the second largest automotive center in the country. Curitiba is an important cultural, political, and economic center in the country. Curitiba has high rates of education and is home to the oldest Brazilian university, the Universidade Federal do Paraná. People from Curitiba are called ''curitibanos'' in Portuguese language, and ''Curitibans'' in English. ==The name== The name ''Curitiba'' comes from the large number of Brazilian "Pines", commonly called "Parana Pine" (''Araucaria angustifolia'') which grew in the region before the city was built.Fenianos, E. (2003) Almanaque Kur'yt'yba, Curitiba: Univer Cidade, p.6 There are two reasons for the name: the Native American of the Tupi nation, namely the Jê and the Guarani, used the word ''corae'' ("pine seed") ''atuba'' ("a lot"). It may also come from joining the words ''kurit'' ("pine tree") and ''yba'' ("large amount"), also from the Tupi language, together. So, "Curitiba" means something like "Land of Abundant Pines". ==Transport== Curitiba has a strategy to maximise the efficiency and productivity of its transport. It does this by using different systems of transport that support each other. The introduction of traffic management, transportation, and land use planning in the 1970s allowed the city to reduce traffic in the downtown area. It also helped to promote the use of public transport and bicycles in order to reduce pollution. File:Bus Stops 2 curitiba brasil.jpg Curitiba does not have a Rapid transit, but it has a large bus network system. In 1974, it opened the second bus rapid transit system in the world. This system has large passenger terminals connected by roads used only by the buses ''Vermelhos'' ("Red Buses"), the ''Expressos'' ("Express Buses"), ''Articulados'' ("Articulated buses"), and ''Biarticulados'' ("Biarticulated buses"). The biarticulated bus makes long trips, stopping only on the tube-station stops to pick up or drop off people. Each biarticulated bus can carry 270 people - and complemented with the modern and speedy silver ''Ligeirinho'' (literally, "speedy"), has fewer stops. As a result, the distances are shorter when compared to the ''Linha Direta'' ("Direct Line"). The buses stop very frequently. Some stop every two minutes. File:CuritibaBusBoarding.jpg This model has inspired similar things in cities of other countries. In New York City, in the 1990s an experimental line of "ligeirinho" in the city connected it to the World Trade Center (1973–2001). The system is the source of inspiration for the TransMilenio in Bogotá, Colombia, Metrovia in Guayaquil, Ecuador,as well as the LACMTA Orange Line of Los Angeles, California, and for a future transportation system in Panama City, Panama. ==City planning== Around the city and commonly joined with the bus terminals, are the ''Ruas da Cidadania'' ("Streets of Citizenship"). These are municipal centers that bring together municipal departments and public agencies, state and federal, points of trade, services, free Internet access and equipment, and leisure, such as playgrounds and space for all kinds of sports. File:Rua xv curitiba.jpg.]] The green area of Curitiba is 51.5metres per person - about three times the minimum area recommended by the UN - one of the highest in Brazil and higher than cities such as London or Paris. These areas are made mostly by municipal parks and forests to protect the forests' gallery of local rivers. There are also many city squares and public grounds, usually associated with public and wooden roads. The urban zoning of the city and the integrated transport system has allowed development of urban architecture. Some analysts say the layout of the city is strong and balanced without the main problems of large modern cities, like heavy traffic. Curitiba was the inspiration for Francis Ford Coppola, In the 20th century when he was looking for the "perfect city" in order to create the New York ''Megalopolis'' (a huge city "which is good for its citizens" for his movie).The movie director lived in Curitiba for a few weeks and praised the city in many of his lectures around the world, as the only Brazilian city praised by this famous producer of movies. He did not make the movie, however. In the 1990s, the city won the United Nations Environment Program prize - UNEP, from the UN, said to be the top prize of the environment in the world. In June 1996, the chairman of the Habitat II summit of mayors and urban planners in Istanbul said Curitiba was "the most innovative city in the world." In 2003, the city received the title of Capital of Culture of the Americas by the organization CAC-ACC. In 2006, Curitiba hosted the event COP8/COP-MOP3 the UN. Today, Curitiba is considered one of the best examples of urban planning in the world.Irazábal, Clara Elena (2002) ''Curitiba and Portland: Architecture, City Making, and Urban Governance in the Era of Globalization'', PhD Dissertation in Architecture, University of California, Berkeley, p.112 File:UNILIVRE-UniversidadeLivreDoMeioAmbiente.Curitiba.JPG, where nowadays is a deep wood of 37.000 m² with native forest, many species of birds and with a lake of 8meters deep, with carp.]] In 1991, the city asked the French oceanographer Jacques Cousteau to open the Free University of the Environment, being an place for learning about the environment and ecology for the population. Since it was created, the UNILIVRE is a reference about studies in economically sustainable care of ecosystems, serving as a model for other similar institutions in various parts of the world, as in Córdoba, Argentina in Argentina, Río Grande, Tierra del Fuego in Patagonia, Seoul in Korea, Guadalajara in Mexico, and in many other Brazilian cities. The Reader's Digest found that it was the Brazilian city best placed in the ranking of the best cities in the world to live in. In March 2001, a poll sponsored by the UN pointed Curitiba as the best capital of Brazil by the Index of Living Conditions (ILC) and second best among the HDI of Brazilian capitals. The city is the gateway to entering the Mercosur (the southern zone common market of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay). The city was the first in Brazil to introduce the separation of domestic garbage on a wide-scale basis. The acclaimed program ''Lixo que não é Lixo'' (literally, "Garbage that isn’t Garbage"; a successful recycling program) created in 1989 has become a model of caring for the environment. Curitiba is the Brazilian city that recycles garbage more often: currently, 22% of all the waste produced - about 450 tons each day - are recycled. In 2007, the city was the third place in a list of "15 Green Cities" in the world, according to the American website "Grist". In the same year, the city was featured in The New York Times saying that Curitiba remains a destination for urban planners from various parts of the world, fascinated with the public transport system, program for recycling of garbage and the group of parks in the city. The MasterCard Emerging Markets Index 2008, created to evaluate and compare the performance of cities in different functions that connect markets and commerce worldwide, shows Curitiba as the safest city in Brazil - considering details such as freedom of expression, risk of natural disasters and personal security. Curitiba won the ''Globe Award Sustainable City 2010'' and was chosen wikt:unanimous by the wikt:committee. At the same year, Curitiba was elected by the ''América Economía'' Magazine as one of the best cities for doing business in Latin America. ==Geography== ===Localization=== Curitiba is on the first plateau of Paraná, in the most flat area, also called Plateau Curitibano. It covers a geographical area of 432.17km², located at 25º25'40"S latitude and 49º16'23"W longitude. The coastline of the state (the Atlantic Ocean) is 70 km away from the city. The capital has a length of 35km from north to south, and 20km from east to west. Distance from Curitiba to some cities of Brazil and Mercosur: File:Curitiba 49.23395W 25.45921S.jpg * São Paulo: 335km/ 208miles * Foz do Iguaçu: 523km/ 288miles * Rio de Janeiro: 671km/ 417miles * Belo Horizonte: 834km/ 518 miles * Asuncion (Paraguay): 846km/ 526miles * Brasília: 1077km/ 669miles * Montevideo (Uruguay): 1244km/ 773miles * Buenos Aires (Argentina): 1331km/ 827miles * Florianópolis: 300km * La Paz (Bolivia): 2194km/ 1363miles * Santiago (Chile): 2254km/ 1400miles * Manaus: 2722km/ 1691miles ===Terrain=== File:Curitiba vista serra do mar.jpg of the Sea (''Serra do Mar''), view of the Center of Curitiba]] The city has surface area of 432.17km² in the First Plateau of Paraná. The average altitude of the city is 934.6m above sea level, ranging between minimum and maximum values of 900 and 1,000 meters, approximately. Curitiba has a wavy topography of smooth rounded hills, an terrain a little wavy, giving a relatively regular appearance. The municipality of Curitiba has an average altitude of 934.6m above sea level, where the highest point is to the north (1,021.0m). To the south it is a bit lower (864.9m). There are mountain ranges and sets of rocky elevations in almost all around the city, being the most remarkable and impressive of the ''Serra do Mar'' (Portuguese for "Mountain Range of the Sea"), in the east that separates the plateau from the coast of Paraná. ===Climate=== File:Southern Brazil in the Winter.jpg Curitiba's climate is usually mild all year round though locals complain that the weather can change at anytime. It can be hot in the winter and cold in the summer. Even in one day, there can be great differences. The flat terrain, lakes and marshland help its mild damp winters, with an average temperature of 13°C (57°F), but it can fall below 0°C (32°F) on the coldest days. During summer, the average temperature is around 21°C (70°F), but sometimes gets around 32°C (90°F) on hot days. ===Hydrography and Pluviometry=== File:Rio iguaçu curitiba.jpg The catchment area of Curitiba has several rivers and streams that cross the city in different directions, grouped in six river basins. The main rivers are: Atuba River, Belém River, Barigüi River, Passaúna River, Ribeirão dos Padilhas and the Iguaçu River. Since the 1970s, Curitiba has worked to minimize the negative impacts of urbanization on rivers. Parks have been built along the rivers with artificial lakes, which retain the water for longer periods of time, minimizing floods. Almost all the rivers are in canalization process. There is 1,500mm rainfall on average per year. It happens, among other reasons, because of the large deforestation of the Mountain Range of the Sea (''Serra do Mar''), a natural barrier to moisture. ===Vegetation=== File:Ipe-amarelo curitiba.jpg Curitiba is in the area of vegetation called Araucaria moist forests, composed of steppes, Araucaria forest and other formations. In the local vegetation there are still parana pines (''Araucaria angustifolia''). The parana pines are now protected by environmental law. The Municipal Secretariat of the Environment maintains a botanical garden and three green houses for the annual production of 150,000 seedlings of native and exotic tree species, 16,000 seedlings of fruit trees, 260,000 seedlings of flowers, foliage and underbrush, on top of the total maintenance of 350,000 seedlings. The green area of the city is one of largest in Brazil. There is a large quantity of purple and yellow ''ipês'' (tabebuias), which flower at the end of winter. The yellow ipê is the most common tree in the city. ===Social issues=== The growth of urban population of Curitiba, that turned the city in a modern metropolis, has generated some social problems. Like other major Brazilian cities, Curitiba has seen the emergence of slums in some neighborhoods and around the city, and the growth of street inhabitants. Crime has increased but is not comparable to other major Brazilian cities. Moreover, many rivers contains levels of pollution; the landfill (deposit of garbage) is almost full; the public transport sometimes is not enough for the number of people (in the rush hour), and the Brazilian government does not pay for the construction of a Rapid transit in the city. ==Architecture== File:PacoDaLiberdadeCuritiba1.JPG A variety of architectural styles, ancient and modern, make the urban landscape of Curitiba very interesting and represent an enormous culture heritage. There is a strong influence of the culture of immigrants mainly from Europe. Buildings in eclectic architecture, neoclassical, colonial, Byzantine#What the Empire left for us, and oriental styles confirm the diversity and cultural richness of Curitiba. It is possible to find places that still keep lambrequins (short ornaments, typical of some European places in the past, on top of roofs or windows), palaces in the urban area, and even the first rotating building in the world. Because it is a planned city, the administration uses a rigid plan for growth, aiming to facilitate the use of public transport. The idea was to organize the city along transport corridors. The buildings are close to major bus lines. The rule is simple: buildings with more than eight floors can only be built in the first block, near the corridor. Buildings with less than eight floors, in the second block, and in other, smaller buildings and houses. This encourages the use of buses, reducing the number of cars. ==The people== In 2007, there were 1,797,408 people living in the city of Curitiba. In 2000, Curitiba was the seventh biggest city in Brazil. Tthe city was the leader in longevity, with the life expectancy at birth at 71.6 years of age.

The city has the largest portion of the structure of government and public services of the Paraná state. It has major companies in the sectors of trade, services and financial things. The city has the strongest economy of the south of the country, because the work of export of more than 900 factories just in the ''Cidade Industrial'' neighborhood and major automobile industries which are in the #Greater Curitiba.

These Lighthouses are free educational centers which include library, Internet access, and other cultural resources. This community libraries works with municipal schools, have a collection of approximately 5000 books, and are designed to diversify the opportunities of access to knowledge, expanding the area of formal education. In each quarter of the city, these "Lighthouses of Knowledge" have been implanted containing library and room of computer science, for public use, mainly by students; job training, social welfare and educational programs are coordinated, and often supply labor to improve the city's amenities or services, as well as education and income. Among the Brazilian capitals, Curitiba has the lowest rate of illiteracy, and is also number 1 in education between the Brazilian capitals. Curitiba has many universities. The ''Universidade Federal do Paraná'' ("Federal University of Paraná") is the most important of the region, and the oldest in Brazil. == Tourism == File:Linha Turismo Curitiba Brasil.jpg Every year, tourism grows in Curitiba. The ''Linha Turismo'' ("Tourism Line") started in 1994. It is a special city tour that visits the principal tourist attractions in Curitiba, featuring comfortable white buses with big windows and a shape similar to that of streetcars. The vehicles have a sound system that plays recorded messages describing sites in Portuguese, English and Spanish. It is possible to visit the parks, Town square and the rest of the city's tourist attractions. Considered one of the best in the country, the ''Linha Turismo'' is available every thirty minutes and has a two and a half-hour tour, which travels around forty-four kilometers.

In 1971 the '''''Teatro Paiol''''' - a construction of 1874, which was used by the Brazilian Army as arsenal of gunpowder and ammunition, was turned into a cultural and scenic area. The '''''Guaíra Theater''''' is one of the largest theaters in all of Latin America. In the #Events, the '''''Memorial of Curitiba''''' is a new and modern site, which found its inspiration in the Parana Pine.

Currently, the Cultural Foundation of Curitiba runs two movie theaters in the downtown area: the ''Cine Luz'' and the ''Cinemateca'' (for special movies), which offer many art movie programs at affordable prices. The ''Cinema a Um Real'' project ("Watch a movie for one Real") is available every Sunday, featuring movies targeted to a more popular taste with cheap prices (R$1,00 - around US $0,40), allowing citizens from low-income classes to go to the movies. Furthermore, the city runs the ''Cinema nos Bairros'' project ("A Movie Theater in Your Neighborhood"), which was designed to allow a larger portion of the population to get to know video productions. The project offers movie sessions for free and schedules weekly sessions at schools, ''Ruas da Cidadania'' ("Citizenship Streets"), parish halls, neighborhood associations as well as other institutions that take part in this partnership project. At these places children get a chance to see how movie projectors work and also have a better grasp of each movie, so that they become increasingly interested in the art of moviemaking. Today, Curitiba has, approximately, 70 movie theatres, with daily programming, and is the first city in Brazil to have an IMAX cinema.
