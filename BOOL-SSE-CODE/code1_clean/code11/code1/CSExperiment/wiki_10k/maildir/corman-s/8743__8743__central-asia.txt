Most of the region was part of the Silk Road. It was a part of the Persian Empire until Alexander The Great captured it. When he died, the land was given to his General officer Seleucus I Nicator. Seleucus slowly lost it to the Parthians. When the Parthians (the Parthians were Persians) lost power, the Sassanids added it to their own Persian empire. However, a couple years later, during about the 600's A.D, Arab army spreading the faith of Islam quickly captured it. A while later, an Iranian dynasty got autonomy under the Abbasid Empire. They were known as the Samanids. The Samanids controlled most of Central Asia and Northwestern Iran. They had power over this area during the 10th century. With them, Central Asian city, such as Bukhara and Samarkand, grew in culture. In the early 13th century the Mongols captured it. They fire it to the ground. A while later, some rulers decided to make their own empires under that of the Mongols. These empires were known as Khanates. During the 19th century the Russian Empire conquered these lands. Many years later in 1991, all of the countries of Central Asia declared independence. In the 14th century, Turkic people armies conquered this area. They were known as the Seljuk Empire. At the same time, Timur captured it. After his death, the Timurids (the name of the people of the dynasty Timur founded) could not hold unto their empire. == Economy == Uzbekistan produces lots of cotton.
