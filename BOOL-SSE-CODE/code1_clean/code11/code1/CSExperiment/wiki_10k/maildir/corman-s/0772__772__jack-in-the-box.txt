A '''jack-in-the-box''', otherwise referred to as a '''jack box''', is a children's toy which is a box from which a figure on a Spring (device) jumps when the top is opened. You twist the knob until the spring shoots out the toy, which you put back in the box and do it all over again. Many kids have fun when they see the jack jumping out from the box. Category:Toys
