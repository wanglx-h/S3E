'''1500''' (Roman numerals) was a leap year starting on Wednesday in the Julian calendar. The year was not a leap year in the proleptic Gregorian calendar. It was the last year of the 15th century. The year was seen as being especially important by many Christians in Europe, who thought it would bring the beginning of the end of the world. Their belief was based on the phrase "half-time after the time", when the apocalypse was due to occur, which appears in the Book of Revelation and was seen as referring to 1500. This time was also just after the Old World's discovery of the Americas in 1492, and therefore was influenced greatly by the New World.[1] Historically, the year 1500 is also often identified, somewhat arbitrarily, as marking the end of the Middle Ages and beginning of the Early Modern Era. The end of this year marked the halfway point of the 2nd millennium, as there were 500 years before it and 500 years after it. == Events == * Europe's population was about 60 million. * January 5 – Duke Ludovico Sforza recaptures Milan, but is soon driven out again by the French. * January 26 – Vicente Pinzon becomes the first European to discover Brazil. * April 21 – Portugal navigator Pedro Álvares Cabral officially discovers Brazil and claims the land for Portugal. * November 11 – Treaty of Granada – Louis XII of France and Ferdinand II of Aragon agree to divide the Kingdom of Naples between them. * Emperor Go-Kashiwabara of Japan ascends to the throne of Japan. * Battle of Hemmingstedt: The Denmark army fails to conquer the peasants' republic of Dithmarschen. * Battle of Lepanto (1500) – The Turkish fleet of Kemal Re'is defeats the Republic of Venice.
