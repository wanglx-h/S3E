File:Spinosaurus skull en.svg'']] A '''skull''', or '''cranium''', is a set of bones that make up the head of a vertebrate and keep in place all body parts in the head.[https://www.britannica.com/science/cephalization Cephalization definition from] Encyclopædia Britannica It supports the structures of the face and forms a protective cavity for the brain.[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/skull Definition of skull from] Merriam-Webster dictionary As well as protecting the brain, the skull fixes the distance between the eyes and between the ears. This allows stereoscopic vision, and helps the brain judge direction and distance of sounds. In some animals, the skull also has a defensive function (e.g. horned ungulates). The frontal bone is where horns are mounted.[https://skull-action.com/collections/skull-rings skull rings] The skull is made of a number of joined (fused) flat bones.
