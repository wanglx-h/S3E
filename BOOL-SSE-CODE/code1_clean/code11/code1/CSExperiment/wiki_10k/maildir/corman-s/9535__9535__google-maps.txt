It provides satellite (artificial) pictures and road maps for anywhere in the world. Google Maps also shows the locations of many wikt:place and businesses (called point of interest). It can provide street addresses, phone numbers, and URLs to their websites. It can generate directions between different places using many ways of transport, such as by car, bike, public transport, and even by airplane, and show traffic congestion. Maps can be embedded on other websites via the Google Maps Application programming interface. It has a feature called Google Street View, which provides photos of streets in some places so one can see what it is like if they were standing in that area of the Earth in real life. Google Maps was started on February 8, 2005, and uses JavaScript, XML and Ajax (programming). Its website works in almost any web browser or through mobile applications on platforms like iOS and Android (operating system). Google has a "Local Guides" program where anybody can write reviews and upload photos or videos of places, as well as make changes to the maps (such as adding new places or removing closed places). This is much like how a person can contribute to Google Translate or to Wikipedia and other Wikimedia Foundation websites. == Features and tools == === Google My Business (Formerly Google Places) === Google My Business (GMB), previously known as Google Places, is a free tool offered by Google that allows businesses and organizations to manage their online presence across Google, particularly within Google Maps and Google Search. It is designed to help businesses of all sizes enhance their visibility, particularly in local search results, and provide accurate and updated information to potential customers. GMB is especially important for local businesses, as it enables them to control the information that appears when someone searches for their business, such as operating hours, location, contact details, and customer reviews. The tool also provides insights into how customers find and interact with the business online. === History and Evolution === Google launched Google Places in 2010 as a way for businesses to claim and manage their local listings on Google Maps. At that time, it focused on providing essential business information, such as address, phone number, and business hours. Google Places allowed businesses to enhance their listings with features like photos and videos. In June 2014, Google Places was rebranded as Google My Business to offer a more integrated and comprehensive tool for businesses. The new platform incorporated features from Google Places, Google+ Local, and Google+ Pages into a unified dashboard, making it easier for businesses to manage their presence across multiple Google services. === Importance for Local SEO === Google My Business is an essential tool for local Search Engine Optimization (SEO). A well-optimized GMB profile can significantly enhance a business’s visibility in local search results, especially in the "Local Pack", the section that appears at the top of Google search results featuring a map and three prominent business listings. Factors that influence a GMB listing’s ranking include relevance, proximity to the searcher, and the quality and quantity of reviews. Regularly updating the business profile, responding to reviews, and ensuring that all information is accurate can improve a business's local search ranking. === Google My Business App === Google also offers a mobile app version of GMB, enabling businesses to manage their listings on the go. The app allows users to update their information, post new content, view insights, and respond to customer reviews directly from their mobile devices. === Rebranding and Integration === Over the years, Google My Business has evolved to integrate more features aimed at helping businesses manage their online presence. In 2021, Google began transitioning GMB into Google Business Profile, a further rebranding effort aimed at simplifying the platform. This rebranding aligns with Google's continuous efforts to streamline its services and improve user experience for business owners. ==Related pages== *Google Earth *Google Maps (application) ==References== ==Other websites== *[http://maps.google.com Google Maps] Category:Google Category:Maps
