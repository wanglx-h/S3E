They believe that if someone changes their body, it is wrong and they are doing something dangerous or ethics. ==Why people do body modification== Body modification is done for different reasons. Religions might tell people that they should change their bodies to look a certain way. Other people with body modifications might just like the way the body modifications look, or how they feel good during sexual intercourse. ==Kinds of body modification== ===Common body modification=== Image:Pode parecer uma semana narcisista.jpg Image:Euler's identity scarification, 3PiCon, Springfield, MA.jpg * ''Body piercing'' is when a hole is made through the skin, and a piece of jewelry is put into the hole. Some piercings can be stretched so they fit larger, thicker kinds of jewelry. * ''Tattoo'' is when ink is put under the skin to make a picture. Whole body tatooing and tattooing of the lips and eyes would be thought extreme by some. * ''Scarification'' is when part of the skin is removed to create a scar. * ''Branding'' is when the skin is burned to create a scar. ==="Extreme" body modification=== * ''Tongue splitting'' is when a person's tongue is split in two like a snake's. * ''Subdermal implant'' is when a small object is placed right underneath a person's skin. * ''Transdermal implant'' is when a small object is placed underneath a person's skin, but part of it pokes out of the skin and is visible. * ''Extra ocular implant'' (eye jewellery) is when a tiny chip of metal is placed in someone's eye. ===Other body modification=== * ''Amputation'' is when a body part is cut off. == References == Category:Body art Category:Surgery Category:Skin
