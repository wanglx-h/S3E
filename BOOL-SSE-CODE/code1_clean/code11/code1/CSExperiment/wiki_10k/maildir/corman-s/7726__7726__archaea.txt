The name comes from Greek αρχαία, "old ones". They are a major division of living organisms. Archaea are tiny, simple organisms. They were originally discovered in extreme environments (extremophiles), but are now thought to be common to more average conditions. Many can survive at very high (over 80°f) or very low temperatures, or highly salty, acidic or alkaline water. Some have been found in geysers, black smokers, oil wells, and hot vents in the deep ocean. Recent research has found ammonia-eating archaea in soil and seawater. In the past they had been classed with bacteria as prokaryotes (or Monera) and named '''archaebacteria''', but this is a mistake. The Archaea have an independent evolution and show many differences in their biochemistry from other forms of life. They are now classified as a separate domain in the Tree of Life. In this system, the three distinct branches of evolutionary descent are the Archaea, Bacteria and Eukaryota. Archaea are, like bacteria, prokaryotes: single-celled organisms that do not have nuclei and cell organelles of the eukaryote type. ==Comparison to other domains== The following table compares some major characteristics of the three domains, to illustrate their similarities and differences.Information is from Willey JM, Sherwood LM, Woolverton CJ. ''Microbiology'' 7th ed. (2008), Ch. 19 pp.474–475, except where noted. Many of these characteristics are also discussed below. {| class="wikitable" |- ! Property ! Archaea ! Bacteria !
