Kebab is usually made of lamb and beef. Sometimes chicken and fish are used for some styles. Pork is never used by Muslims but is sometimes used by non-Muslim sellers. Muslims are not allowed to eat pork, for Halal. There are many varieties of kebab and the term means different things in different countries. The generic term kebab usually refers to doner kebab or ''döner kebap'' in Europe and to '''Gyros''' in the United States, though its meaning can vary. In South Asia the term can refer to a whole range of items such as Chappali kabab, Shami kabab, Bihari kabab and so on. ==History== File:Akrotiri terracotta firedogs with zoomorphic finials.jpg, 17th century BC]] There are evidence of hominin use of fire and cooking that was used in the Middle East around 790,000 years ago, and prehistoric hearths, earth ovens, and burnt animal bones were spread across Europe and the Middle East by at least 250,000 years ago.
