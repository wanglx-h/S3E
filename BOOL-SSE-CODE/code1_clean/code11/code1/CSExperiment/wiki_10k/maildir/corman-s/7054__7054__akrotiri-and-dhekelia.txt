They are used as military bases by the United Kingdom. The bases were kept by the United Kingdom after Cyprus changed from being a colony in the British Empire, to being an independent republic. The United Kingdom kept them because of the important location of Cyprus in the Mediterranean Sea. == Military bases == The smallest of the bases is known as Akrotiri Sovereign Base Area or even the Western Sovereign Base Area. == References == ==Other websites== Category:British overseas territories Category:Geography of Cyprus Category:Military buildings and structures
