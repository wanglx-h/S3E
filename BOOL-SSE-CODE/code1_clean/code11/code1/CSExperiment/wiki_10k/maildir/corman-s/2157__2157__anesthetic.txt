There are two types: general anaesthesia causes a reversible loss of consciousness. Local anaesthetic cause a loss of sensitivity (and pain) on a local area. Anaesthetics can be rubbed onto the skin, given by injection ("shot"), or given as a gas to breathe. Anaesthesia blocks pain during operations. This lets patients undergo surgery and other procedures without the distress and pain they would normally feel. It comes from the Greek roots an-, "without" and aesthetos, "perceptible, able to feel". The most famous anaesthetic, Diethyl ether#history, may have been made as early as the 8th century,Evans TC (1928). "The opium question, with special reference to Persia (book review)". Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. 21 (4): 339–40. doi:10.1016/S0035-9203(28)90031-0. The earliest known mention of the poppy is in the language of the Sumerians, a non-Semitic people who descended from the uplands of Central Asia into Southern Mesopotamia ... but it took many centuries for its anaesthetic importance to be appreciated. The history of modern anaesthetic began with Joseph Lister. Before it, people sometimes used cocaine, alcohol, and other drugs to get the same effects. Modern anaesthesia is complex, with a combination of anesthesia, analgesic and muscle relaxation. These three are known as the "triad of anesthesia". == References == == Related pages == * Anesthesiologist * Nitrous oxide * Sedative Category:Anesthetics Category:Pain
