Subject: Fallopian tube
The '''fallopian tubes''' (also known as '''oviducts''' and '''uterine tubes''') connect the ovary to the uterus. The fallopian tubes let the ovum pass into the uterus. The ovum is able to be fertilized by sperm during sexual intercourse. == Origin == They are named after the 16th century Italy anatomist, Gabriele Falloppio. The Ancient Greek word salpinx (σαλπιγξ) means "trumpet". == Anatomy == There are two Fallopian tubes attached to either side of the end of the uterus. Each tube will end near one ovary. This place is called the fimbria. The Fallopian tubes are not attached to the ovaries, but open into the peritoneum. In humans, the Fallopian tubes are about 7 - 14 centimetre long. === Parts === There are four parts of the fallopian tube from the ovary to the uterus: - "The Female Pelvis: The Oviduct" * Infundibulum *Ampulla - where the ovum is fertilized * isthmus tubae uterinae === Layers === File:Fallopian tube (lamina propoia).JPG The fallopian tube is made of three layers:[http://www.gfmer.ch/International_activities_En/El_Mowafi/Fallopian_tube.htm Fallopian tube] * Mucosa - these are folded walls with ciliated cells along them. * Muscularis externa * Serosa === Movement === The Fallopian tubes can move around the pelvis. == Fertilization == When an ovum is ready to be released from the ovary, the ovary wall breaks open and the ovum goes into the fallopian tube. There, it starts moving towards to uterus with the help of liquids and cilia on the inside walls. This can take hours or days. If the ovum is Fertilized egg while in the fallopian tube, then it sticks to the endometrium, which is the beginning of pregnancy. ==Related pages== * Menstrual cycle * wikt:Ovum on wiktionary == References == Category:Anatomy of the female reproductive system Category:Female reproductive system Category:Pregnancy and childbirth
