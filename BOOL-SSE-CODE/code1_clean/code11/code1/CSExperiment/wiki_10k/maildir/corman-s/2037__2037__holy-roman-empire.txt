On 25 December 800, Pope Leo III crowned Francia King Charlemagne as Roman emperor and revived the title in Western Europe for the first time since the fall of the ancient Western Roman Empire in 476. When Charlemagne died in 814, the Frankish Empire was given to his sons and divided into three different countries: West Francia, Lotharingia and East Francia. In 962, Otto the Great was crowned emperor by List of popes. The empire would last for over eight centuries, until it ended in 1806. At the start of the empire, the emperor was quite powerful. As time went on, however, the empire's duchy and county became more powerful than the emperor. == Politics == Since Charlemagne, the polity was simply called the "Roman Empire". The name "Holy Roman Empire" was not used until the 13th century. Before then, people had called the empire by different names like ''universum regnum'' ("the whole kingdom", meaning that it included all regions, not just local kingdoms) and ''imperium christianum'' ("Christian empire"). The emperor's right to rule came from the idea of ''translatio imperii'' ("transfer of rule"), which meant that he had the highest power, which had been passed down from the Ancient Rome emperors. The Holy Roman Empire was not very centralised, unlike most countries today. Instead, it was divided into dozens and eventually hundreds of individual entities, which were governed by kings, dukes, counts, bishops, abbots and other rulers, who were collectively known as Prince. The emperor directly ruled some areas, but he could not simply issue decrees and govern autonomously over the empire. His power was severely restricted by the various local leaders. In the 16th century, the empire had to deal with the rebellion of the Frisian people, which was led by Pier Gerlofs Donia and Wijerd Jelckama, from 1515 to 1523. The empire was a rare state in Europe to have an elective monarchy. The emperor was chosen by a small group of prince-electors, but the previous emperor's Dynasty heir was commonly elected to the throne. Until 1596 the elected emperor was crowned by the Pope to make him a real emperor. The House of Habsburg ruled most of the time between about 1280 and 1806, the end of the empire.
