File:Feta Greece 2.jpg '''Feta cheese''' (, feminine gender; pronounced ), or simply '''Feta''' is a kind of cheese. Usually it is made from the milk of sheep or goats. Feta cheese originally is from the Greece mainland, or from Lesbos in the Aegean Sea. It is an ingredient in a Greek Salad. Other cheese (which is usually not from Greece and is usually made from cow milk) must not be called ''Feta'' from 2007. The European Court said so in its decisions C-465/02 and C-466/02 (from October 25, 2005). This ruling is only valid for the European Union, and other countries in Europe. Several member state of the WTO still think that the term "feta" is generic.[http://www.commerce.nic.in/ip-c-w-360.pdf Implications of Article 23 extension] .

Homer must have known about it. There were several references to the cheese in the ''Odyssey''. According to the myth, the cyclops Polyphemos was the first cheese manufacturer. He carried the milk in animal-skin bags. He had collected the milk from his sheep. He was very surprised to see that days later the milk had become solid. When Polyphemus tried to eat it, it tasted well. He also found that as such a solid, it would go bad later than with milk. The name ''Feta'' has an Italian origin. It is derived from ''fetta'' (slice), and dates back to the 17th century. Very likely this referred to the method of cutting the cheese in slices to put it in barrels. ==References== == Other websites == * [http://www.dodonicheese.com/Home/Products/General/POP.xml.aspx?Language=2 Feta registered as Protected Designation of Origin] * [http://www.feta.gr/english-html/index.htm http://www.feta.gr] on feta's history, production and conservation methods, plus dozens of recipes with feta Category:Cheeses Category:Greek food
