The winners of the most recent World Series in 2024 were the Los Angeles Dodgers. They defeated the New York Yankees. The New York Yankees have 27 World Series championships, the most of any team. The Cleveland Indians currently hold the longest active drought, having last won the Series before expansion teams were formed.
