File:Water008.jpg, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany]] A '''waterfall''' is a place where water rushes down a steep ledge. The water flows from higher land, then it falls down a big step of rock to lower land of softer rock where it will continue on its journey. The lower land is usually in a gorge. Waterfalls are often made when a river is young, in places where softer rock is underneath harder rock in the waterfalls. Many people like to visit waterfalls. The roar from a big waterfall is very loud. Some people think it is beautiful music and that a waterfall is one of the most beautiful things in nature.Carreck, Rosalind, ed (1982).
