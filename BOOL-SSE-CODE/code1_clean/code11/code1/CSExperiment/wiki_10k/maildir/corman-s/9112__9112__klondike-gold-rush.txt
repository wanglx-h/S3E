Subject: Klondike Gold Rush
File:Klondike mining camp.jpg camp in the Klondike region]] The '''Klondike Gold Rush''' happened in the 1890s when many people went to the Klondike region of the Yukon, in Canada. They hoped to find gold there and become rich. Many of these prospecting came from the United States. Gold was first found in Klondike in a creek called Rabbit Creek. Prospectors named the creek "Bonanza Creek" because of the gold (''bonanza ''means a lucky source of wealth). Four million dollars worth of gold was found. Going to the gold fields was difficult. Most people who started the journey did not arrive. Very few who arrived found any gold. The city that likely profited most from the Klondike Gold Rush was Dawson City, Yukon in Canada.
