The ancient Romes began rule of the city around 60 BC. Later it became capital of Gallia Aquitania. In the 400s the city was looting by the Vandals, Visigoths, and Franks. After the Battle of Tours, Odo the Great was able to hold only a small part of Aquitaine where Bordeaux was located. It became one of the last cities to fall under King Pepin the Short. Bordeaux once again became an important city after the marriage of Duchess Eleanor of Aquitaine of Duchy of Aquitaine with Count Henri Plantagenet. He became King Henry II of England of Kingdom of England only months after their marriage. In 1653 Bordeaux was added to the Kingdom of France, when the army of Louis XIV of France entered the city. In 1870 the French government moved to Bordeaux for a time. This was at the beginning of the Franco-Prussian war against Kingdom of Prussia. The temporary move happened again during World War I and again very briefly during the World War II. == Education == * École nationale supérieure d'électronique, informatique, télécommunications, mathématiques et mécanique de Bordeaux * École pour l'informatique et les nouvelles technologies * École spéciale de mécanique et électricité * Institut supérieur européen de gestion group * E-Artsup * Institut supérieur européen de formation par l'action * University of Bordeaux 1 * Kedge Business School ==Sister cities== Bordeaux is twinned with: {| class="wikitable" |- valign="top" | * Bristol, United Kingdom, since 1947 * Lima, Peru, since 1957 * Quebec City, Canada, since 1962 * Munich, Germany, since 1964 * Los Angeles, United States, since 1968 || * Bern, Switzerland since 1978 * Japan, since 1982 * Bilbao, Spain * Zurich, Switzerland, since 2014 * Israel, since 1984 || * Warsaw, Poland, since 2009 * Casablanca, Morocco, since 1988 * Oran, Algeria, since 2003 * Berlin, Germany, since 2010 |} ===Partnerships=== {| class="wikitable" |- valign="top" | * Saint Petersburg, Russia, since 1993 * Bratislava, Slovakia, since 1993 * Los Angeles, United States * Budapest, Hungary since 2010 |} ==References== ==Other websites== Category:Bordeaux Category:Capital of France Category:Former national capitals Category:World Heritage Sites in France
