The three main candidates to become Prime Minister of the United Kingdom are shown to the right. The election resulted in the Labour Party (UK) and it's leader Tony Blair winning a majority in the House of Commons for the third time in a row. The Labour Party did lose 47 of their seats in parliament and the amount of votes they got dropped by 5.5% from the 2001 General Election. Many people believe the Labour Party lost support because of Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair's unpopular decision to send troops to Iraq in 2003. ==Results== * '''Labour Party (UK)''' (355 MP's, 35.2% of vote) * '''Conservative Party (UK)''' (198 MP's, 32.4% of vote) * '''Liberal Democrats''' (62 MP's, 22.0% of vote) * UK Independence Party (0 MP's, 2.2% of vote) * '''Scottish National Party''' (6 MP's, 1.5% of vote) - Scotland only * Green Party of England and Wales (0 MP's, 1.0% of vote) - England and Wales only * '''Democratic Unionist Party''' (9 MP's, 0.9% of vote) - Northern Ireland only * '''British National Party''' (0 MP's, 0.7% of vote) * '''Plaid Cymru''' (3 MP's, 0.6% of vote) - Wales only * '''Sinn Féin''' (5 MP's, 0.6% of vote) - Northern Ireland only * '''Ulster Unionist Party''' (1 MP, 0.5% of vote) - Northern Ireland only * '''Social Democratic and Labour Party''' (3 MP's, 0.5% of vote) - Northern Ireland only * '''Respect Party''' (1 MP, 0.3% of vote) * Scottish Socialist Party (0 MP's, 0.2% of vote) - Scotland only * Veritas (0 MP's, 0.1% of vote) * Alliance Party of Northern Ireland (0 MP's, 0.1% of vote) - Northern Ireland only * Scottish Green Party (0 MP's, 0.1% of vote) - Scotland only * Socialist Labour Party (0 MP's, 0.1% of vote) * Liberal Party (UK, 1989) (0 MP's, 0.1% of vote) * English Democrats (0 MP's, 0.1% of vote) - England only The constituency of Blaenau Gwent and Wyre Forest elected Independent candidates.
