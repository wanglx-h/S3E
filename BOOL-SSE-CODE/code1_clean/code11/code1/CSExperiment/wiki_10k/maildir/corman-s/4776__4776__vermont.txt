Its Capital (city) is Montpelier, Vermont, and its largest city is Burlington, Vermont. It is one of the six New England states. About 640,000 people lived there in 2020. The states that border Vermont are Massachusetts to the south, New Hampshire to the east, New York (state) to the west, and the Canada province of Quebec to the north. Vermont was home to the Abenaki and Iroquois Native American groups until France took control of the area when it was building colonies. Great Britain gained control after winning the French and Indian War. It is known for being one of only four states to be an independent nation before joining the United States. It was not a part of the 13 colonies, as it joined as the 14th state. Vermont became a state in 1791. It is world-renowned for its maple syrup industry, and many tourists go to see brilliant colors the trees become in the fall months. The tourism industry has become quite successful, with many tourists coming every year.
