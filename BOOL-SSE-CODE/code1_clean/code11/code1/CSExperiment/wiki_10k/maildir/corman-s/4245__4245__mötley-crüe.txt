They were one of the biggest glam metal bands of the 1980s. What was planned to be their final show took place at the Staples Center in Los Angeles on December 31, 2015. Yet reunited in 2018 and have been touring active since. ==History== ===1980s=== Mötley Crüe was formed at the start of 1981. At first the band consisted of Vocal-Guitar Greg Leon, bassist Nikki Sixx, and drummer Tommy Lee. After Audition, they found singer Vince Neil at a party and guitar player Mick Mars via an Advertisement in a paper. They released their first album, ''Too Fast For Love,'' in 1981. The band later got signed to a major Record label. They built success over the next few years with their next three albums, ''Shout at the Devil'', ''Theatre of Pain'' and ''Girls, Girls, Girls''. Hit songs like "Shout at the Devil" "Home Sweet Home" and "Girls, Girls, Girls" came off these albums. However, the band's popularity dropped due to their use of illegal drugs, large amounts of Sexual intercourse with Woman, and how they looked, such as wearing make-up and several Tattoo. Nikki Sixx Overdose on heroin in 1987, and was legally dead for two minutes before getting an Epinephrine shot. This made him Consciousness again. The band stopped doing drugs and drinking shortly after. They released their most popular album, ''Dr. Feelgood,'' in 1989. ===1990s=== They released a greatest hits album in 1991 so Fan (person) had something to listen to before they brought out a sixth album. However, relations between the band members got worse. Vince Neil left the band in 1992. So, the band found a new singer named John Corabi, who also played guitar and Songwriter lyrics. They released their self-titled album in 1994. It created a mixed response from fans who preferred Vince Neil as the band's singer, and did not like the music itself. It was more in-line with hard rock and alternative metal than the band's Icon glam metal sound. John Corabi left in 1996 and Vince Neil came back. The band released ''Generation Swine'' in 1997, but the album created a mixed response over their musical Experiment. Tommy Lee was unhappy with Vince Neil back in the band and further Argument between band members caused Lee to leave the band. He was replaced by Randy Castillo. The band released their least successful album, ''New Tattoo'', in 2000. ===2000s=== It sounded more like the band's 80s albums rather than the more Alternative music albums they released in the 90s. After the album, Randy Castillo became Disease and Samantha Maloney had to drum during some of the band's concerts. Randy Castillo died in 2002, and the band did not do much for the next two years. Mötley Crüe made a comeback with Tommy Lee in 2004, and were once again successful. The band toured worldwide and released another greatest hits album called ''Red, White and Crüe''. They also released an album of new songs in 2008 called ''Saints of Los Angeles''. ===2010s=== The band disbanded after their planned last concert on December 31, 2015. However, they got back together in 2018. ==Albums== * ''Too Fast for Love'' (1981) * ''Shout at the Devil'' (1983) * ''Theatre of Pain'' (1985) * ''Girls, Girls, Girls'' (1987) * ''Dr.Feelgood''
