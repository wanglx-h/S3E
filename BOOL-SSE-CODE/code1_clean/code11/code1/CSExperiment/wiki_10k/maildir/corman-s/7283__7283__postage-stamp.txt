Country ]]File:Inverted Jenny.jpg", a very rare and expensive U.S. stamp, 1918]] '''Postage stamps''' are pieces of paper which signal that payment has been made for the item to be mailed. These days they have adhesive on the back. They are put on the top right-hand corner of an envelope. They pay the fee for having the mail take the envelope to where it is being sent. The idea was British, and the first postage stamps were issued in Britain in the mid-nineteenth century. On 1 May 1840, the Penny Black, the first adhesive postage stamp, was issued in the United Kingdom. There are a lot of different postage stamps in the world. Most countries have their own stamps. People collect them in books called stamp albums. Sometimes, the stamps all have errors in the printing like in the "Inverted Jenny" picture with the aeroplane printed upside down. ==People on stamps== People on stamps is one more common topic in stamp collecting.
