The work done in this case equals the gain in potential energy of the block.]]1 J is defined as the amount of energy wikt:transfer to an object when a force of 1 Newton (unit) (kg m s-2) is wikt:exert on it over a distance of 1 metre (1 J = 1 N Multiplication 1 Metre), which is related to the Watt, a unit of Power (physics): One watt is defined as one joule per second of energy transfer. Algebraically, work done in classical mechanics (''W'') can be expressed as: ''F'' Dot product ''s''}} ==Electromagnetism== ===Electronics=== 1 J is defined as the work done for one ampere of electric current to pass through an electric circuit with external Electrical resistance equivalent to one ohm per second. It can be illustrated by the following equations: ''E'' = ''C'' ''V'' — (1)''V'' = ''I'' ''R'' — (2)''P'' = ''V'' ''I'' — (3)''E'' = ''P'' ''t'' — (4)Combining (2), (3) and (4),''E'' = ''I2'' ''R'' ''t'' where ''V'' is the voltage, ''E'' is the electrical energy, ''C'' is the Electric charge, ''I'' is the current, ''R'' is the resistance, ''P'' is the Power (physics) and ''t'' is the time of energy transfer. ==Atomic physics== Arithmetic, 1 J List of mathematical symbols 6.24 × 1012 MElectronvolt due to Albert Einstein#Mass-energy equivalence.
