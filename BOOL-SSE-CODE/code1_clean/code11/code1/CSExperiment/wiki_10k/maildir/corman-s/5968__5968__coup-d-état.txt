Subject: Coup d'état
A '''coup d'état''' (IPA []), or just '''coup''' ([]) for short, is the removal of a head of state and/or a head of government from power (overthrow). Unlike a revolution in which large numbers of people usually take over, a coup can be done by a small number of people. Even one person can cause a coup, such as Idi Amin for example, who controlled the Uganda Army. Coups can also be organized by other countries, such as the Iranian coup d’état (1953). One well-known failed coup was the Beer Hall Putsch in which Adolf Hitler tried to take over the government of Bavaria, a state in Germany. Other failed coups include the 20 July Plot against Hitler and the Gunpowder Plot against King James VI and I of Scotland and England. The term comes from the French language for "a (sudden) blow (or strike) to a state". Informally, ''coup'' is sometimes used to refer to takeovers or wins, in places other than government such as in a company or corporation. Category:Coups d'état
