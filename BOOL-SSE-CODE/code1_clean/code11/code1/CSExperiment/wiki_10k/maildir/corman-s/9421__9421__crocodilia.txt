The order (biology) '''Crocodilia''' is a group of archosaur reptiles. There are three living family (biology) of crocodilians. Some crocodilians are crocodiles, alligators, gharials, and caimans. Crocodilians first evolved during the Jurassic period. They are descendents of a much wider group of archosaurs called the crocodylomorphs. These, in the Upper Triassic, were slender land-living animals. The crocodylomorphs, in turn, were part of an even larger group, the Crurotarsi, which are first seen early in the Triassic. Crocodilians are the sister group of the dinosaurs. This means crocodilians are the closest living relatives to birds. They are both survivors of the Archosauria.
