They have a long history. They number around 35 million people and most of them live in India. Hindus believe that Brahma created the world. He then created 16 sons from different parts of his body. His 17th son, Shree Chitraguptjee, was created from his mind and soul. He is the only son to be made from the whole body, not just parts.
