He was the oldest serving member of the United States Senate to date and the only senator to reach 100 while in office. He was also Governor of his home state South Carolina and a President (United States) candidate. He was a lawyer. Thurmond spent more than 70 years of his life in public service. Before World War II he served as state senator and judge. During war he served in the United States Army in Europe and briefly in Asia. In 1959 he was promoted to the rank of major general. ==Early life== Thurmond was born on December 5, 1902 in Edgefield, South Carolina, South Carolina. His family used to own Slavery in the United States, including ancestors of Al Sharpton. He studied at Clemson University. Thurmond graduated in 1923. He was married to Jean Crouch from 1947 until they divorced in 1960. Then he was married to Nancy Moore from 1968 until his death in 2003. He had five children. ==Career== File:Strom Thurmond, c 1961 (cropped).jpg From 1947 to 1951 he served as Governor of South Carolina (as a Democrat). During 1948 U.S. Presidential Election he became the presidential candidate of the Democratic Party faction called "Dixiecrat" (States Rights Democrat, mostly from the South) - people who supported racial segregation and opposed civil rights laws. Thurmond and his vice presidential candidate, Mississippi Governor Fielding Lewis Wright finished the race in 3rd (behind Harry Truman and Thomas E. Dewey) with 39 electoral votes and they carried 4 states (Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and, of course, Thurmond's home state). In 1957, he filibustered (delayed) the for 24 hours. Despite the long hours, he failed and the bill passed. He was elected, as first write-in candidate for major national office, to the Senate in 1954. He was reelected for his first full term in 1956 and served until January 2003. He was originally a Democrat, but in 1964 he openly supported Barry Goldwater's presidential bid and became a Republican. ===Later career=== As the longest serving Republican he was President pro tempore of the United States Senate for three occasions (1981-1987, 1995-2001, and January 2001-June 2001), when Republican gained a majority. After Democrats took over the control of the Senate in June 2001 Thurmond became first honorary "president pro tempore emeritus". ===Longevity=== File:Senator Thurmond 100th Birthday.jpg Thurmond turned 100 years old on December 5, 2002, while still in office, the oldest person ever to serve in the U.S. Senate. Started his career as opponent of racial integration, in his later years Thurmond supported desegregation. His longtime Senate rival, Robert Byrd of West Virginia surpassed Thurmond's record of length of senatorial service in 2006. Byrd died in 2010. ==Essie Mae Washington-Williams== After Thurmond's death in 2003, an attorney for his family confirmed that in 1925, when he was 22, Thurmond fathered a mixed-race daughter, Essie Mae Washington-Williams, with his family's housekeeper, Cassie Butler, then 16 years old. Thurmond paid for the girl's college education and provided other support. Washington-Williams died in February 2013 at the age of 87. ==Death== Thurmond died in his sleep on June 26, 2003, at 9:45p.m. of heart failure at a hospital in Edgefield, South Carolina. He was 100 years old. Then-Senator Joe Biden delivered a eulogy, and later to the family burial plot in Willowbrook Cemetery in Edgefield, where he was buried. ==References== ==Other websites== * [http://sti.clemson.edu/ Strom Thurmond Institute at Clemson University] * [http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/News_Thurmond.htm U.S. Senate historical page on Strom Thurmond] * [http://www.sciway.net/hist/governors/thurmond.html SCIway Biography of Strom Thurmond] * [http://www.nga.org/portal/site/nga/menuitem.29fab9fb4add37305ddcbeeb501010a0/?vgnextoid=43c75e82a858a010VgnVCM1000001a01010aRCRD&vgnextchannel=e449a0ca9e3f1010VgnVCM1000001a01010aRCRD NGA Biography of Strom Thurmond] * [http://docsouth.unc.edu/sohp/A-0334/menu.html Oral History Interview with Strom Thurmond] from [http://docsouth.unc.edu/sohp Oral Histories of the American South] * [http://sites.google.com/site/stromthurmondfoundation/ Strom Thurmond Foundation, Inc.] * [http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1989/011889c.htm ''Remarks at the Presentation Ceremony for the Presidential Citizens Medal – January 18, 1989''] * [http://www.booknotes.org/Watch/39360-1/Nadine+Cohodas.aspx ''Booknotes'' interview with Nadine Cohodas on ''Strom Thurmond and the Politics of Southern Change'', April 4, 1993.] * [http://americanrhetoric.com/speeches/joebidenstromthurmondeulogy.htm Complete transcript and audio and video of Sen.
