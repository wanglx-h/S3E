File:Biotechnology.jpg '''Biotechnology''' is a technology that involves the use of organism. Biotechnology is mainly used in agriculture, food science, and medicine. In biotechnology, living organisms are used to make useful chemicals and products or to perform an industrial task. == Examples == An example of biotechnology is the use of the fermentation reaction in yeast to make beer and other alcoholic drinks. Another example is the use of carbon dioxide produced by yeast to make bread rise. == Usage == Biotechnology is often used to refer to genetic engineering technology of the 21st century.Rasmussen, Nicolas 2014. ''Gene jockeys: life science and the rise of biotech enterprise''. Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press. The term is used for many ways of modifying biological organisms for the needs of humanity. It started with modifications of native plants into improved food crops through artificial selection and hybridization. Biological engineering is the science upon which all biotechnological applications are based. With the development of new approaches and modern techniques, traditional biotechnology industries are also acquiring new horizons enabling them to improve the quality of their products and increase the productivity of their systems. Biotechnology has also made clone (the process duplicating organisms) possible. A lot of people think that this is morally wrong while others think it could solve many diseases. Biotechnology can be used to solve a great number of problems,Oliver, Richard W. ''The coming biotech age''. ranging from product efficiency to reducing global warming. == Related pages == *Bioinformatics *Genetic engineering *Genetically modified food *Nanotechnology == References == Category:Biotechnology
