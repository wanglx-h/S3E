With help from his cousin Clara, Harry enlists Casey Brown, an American foster child known for her street smarts. Casey pretends to be Lady St. Edmund's long-lost granddaughter to find the treasure and save Candleshoe from money troubles. When Casey arrives, she finds out Candleshoe is struggling financially. The butler, Priory, pretends to be different people to hide that some staff have been let go. Casey decides to find the treasure to help Candleshoe, not for Harry. During her search, Casey confronts Harry's friends and gets hurt trying to stop them from stealing. While getting better, Casey hears Candleshoe will go broke without the stolen money. Casey tells Lady St. Edmund where the treasure is and decides to find it. With Priory and local kids helping, Casey solves clues that lead to the treasure hidden in Candleshoe. They face Harry's friends and protect the estate until the police come, finding the treasure by accident. Candleshoe is saved, Harry's plan is revealed, and Casey plans to go back to Los Angeles. Lady St. Edmund asks Casey to stay forever, but Casey isn't sure if she really belongs. Eventually, Casey decides to stay, and the movie ends with the mystery of her family background still unknown. The clues to find the treasure are a colorful window, a poem, a ship painting, and a statue. These clues help Casey discover the hidden treasure and save Candleshoe. ==Cast== * Jodie Foster as Casey Brown * David Niven as Priory * Helen Hayes as Lady Gwendolyn St. Edmund * Leo McKern as Harry Bundage * Vivian Pickles as Clara Grimsworthy * Veronica Quilligan as Cluny * Ian Sharrock as Peter * Sarah Tamakuni as Anna * David Samuels as Bobby * John Alderson (actor) as Jenkins * Mildred Shay as Mrs. McCress, Casey’s Foster Mother * Michael Balfour (actor) as Mr. McCress, Casey’s Foster Father * Sydney Bromley as Mr. Thresher * Michael Segal as Train Guard == Location == Compton Wynyates, in Warwickshire, was where they filmed Candleshoe in the movie.
