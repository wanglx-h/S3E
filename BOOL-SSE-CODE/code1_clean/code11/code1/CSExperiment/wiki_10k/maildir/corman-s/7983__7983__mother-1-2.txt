Much of the music is different than the console games (''Mother 2'' is mostly the same, but ''Mother'' was changed a lot to make it similar to the United States one that was not sold). == Other websites == * [http://www.nintendo.co.jp/n08/a2uj/index.html Official ''Mother 1 + 2'' website (Japan)] * [http://www.mother-jp.net/ Mother Party (Japanese)] * [http://www.starmen.net/mother12 Mother 1 + 2 Starmen.Net] * [http://www.mother2.net/ Mother2.net] * [http://www.ebipm.net/ EarthBound IPM] Category:Game Boy Advance games Category:2003 video games Category:Mother (video game series) Category:Japan-exclusive video games
