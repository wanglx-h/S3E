'''The Zapotec''' are a native tribe of people from Mexico. People think there are between 300.000 and 400.000 people. Most of them live in the state of Oaxaca. Most of them speak either Zapotec languages or the Chatino language. Before Christopher Columbus came to Americas, the Zapotec civilisation was highly developed. It also included a system of writing. ==References== *Malinowski, Sharon; Sheets, Anna, ed.
