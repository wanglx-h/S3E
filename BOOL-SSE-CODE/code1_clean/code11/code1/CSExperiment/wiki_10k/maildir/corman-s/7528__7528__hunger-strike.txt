Subject: Hunger strike
A '''hunger strike''' is a way that people protest by Fasting. Many people have done this to get people's attention, especially the attention of leaders. Sometimes, hunger strikes are done by people who are in prison. In this case, the hunger strikes are sometimes ended by force feeding, when the prisoners are fed against their will through a feeding tube. ==References== ==Related pages == *Strike action Category:Deaths from starvation Category:Political prisoners Category:Protests
