It is the oldest state in Australia and is sometimes called the "Premier State". Of all Australian states, New South Wales has the most people. The capital city of New South Wales is Sydney. Sydney is the biggest city in Australia. New South Wales was named by Lieutenant James Cook (later Captain Cook), who sailed up the east coast of Australia in 1770. New South Wales was founded (begun) in 1788, by the British who set up a small penal colony on the land of various Aboriginal tribes who had been there for tens of thousands of years. The British colony of New South Wales originally included more than half of the Australian mainland, as well as New Zealand, Lord Howe Island and Norfolk Island. During the 19th century large areas were separated to form the British colonies of Tasmania, South Australia, Victoria, Queensland and New Zealand. == Geography == New South Wales has four main Geography areas: * A coastal strip, which runs the whole length of the coast from the Queensland border to the Victorian border. In some places this is a wide plain. In other places it is just a very narrow strip of land between mountains and the sea. The regions of the coastal strip are the North Coast, New South Wales (which borders with Queensland), the Central Coast, New South Wales, the Newcastle, New South Wales region, the Sydney region (which is called the Cumberland Plain), the Illawarra (which is the region around the city of Wollongong) and the Shoalhaven around Nowra, New South Wales. :The climate of this area ranges from ''cool temperate'' on the far south coast to ''subtropical'' near the Queensland border. This whole of the coastal strip is affected by the sea. For this reason, the temperatures are often cooled in the summer by sea breezes, and warmed in the winter by the currents along the coast. This makes the climate less hot and less cold than that of the inland regions. There is also more rain than there is farther inland where it is often very dry. For this reason, the three largest cities are all on the coast. The coast also has more intensive agriculture than the inland areas, with dairy cattle and vegetables crops, as well as sugar cane and bananas in the north. * The mountainous areas of the Great Dividing Range and the high country around them run parallel to the coast from Queensland to Victoria. This includes the New England (Australia) region, the Central Tablelands, the Blue Mountains (New South Wales) near Sydney, the Southern Highlands, New South Wales and the Snowy Mountains. * The agricultural plains fill a big portion of the state's area, with many fewer people than the coast, includes the Riverina area around Wagga Wagga, New South Wales. * The dry plains in the far north-west of the state, have a few small communities. The state is bordered on the north by Queensland, on the west by South Australia, and on the south by Victoria (Australia). Its coast faces the Tasman Sea. New South Wales contains two Federal Territories: the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), and the Jervis Bay Territory. New South Wales' three big cities are Sydney, Newcastle, New South Wales and Wollongong, New South Wales which all lie along the coast. Other big towns include Albury, New South Wales which borders with Victoria, Australia; Broken Hill, New South Wales, the most westerly large town; Dubbo, New South Wales; Orange, New South Wales, Bowral, Bathurst, New South Wales, home of the Bathurst 1000; Port Macquarie, New South Wales, Tamworth, New South Wales, home to the country music festival; Armidale, New South Wales, Inverell, New South Wales, Lismore, New South Wales, Nowra, New South Wales, Gosford, New South Wales, Griffith, New South Wales, Queanbeyan, New South Wales, Leeton, New South Wales, Wagga Wagga, New South Wales, Goulburn, New South Wales, where a lot of Australia's fruit is grown and Coffs Harbour, New South Wales, a popular tourist destination. == Demographics == The population of New South Wales at the end of June 2007 was 6.89 million people. Population grew by 1.1% over the preceding year, lower than the national rate of 1.5%. 62.9% of NSW's population is based in Sydney.[http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/39433889d406eeb9ca2570610019e9a5/0314304e999c07a0ca2572de00150218!OpenDocument 1338.1 - New South Wales in Focus, 2007] File:Newcastle view.jpg foreshore]] File:Subpointlookout.jpg from the Illawarra escarpment]] File:Sydneybalmain.jpg with The Rocks, New South Wales on the left and Darling Harbour, New South Wales on the right]] {| class="wikitable sortable" ! bgcolor="#c0c0c0" | '''Rank''' ! bgcolor="#c0c0c0" | '''Statistical division/district''' ! bgcolor="#c0c0c0" | '''June 2007 population''' |- | 1 | '''Sydney''' | 4,336,374 |- | 2 | Newcastle, New South Wales | 523,662 |- | 3 | Wollongong, New South Wales | 280,159 |- | 4 | Wagga Wagga, New South Wales | 56,147 |- | 5 | Tweed Heads, New South Wales | 50,726 |- | 6 | Coffs Harbour, New South Wales | 50,726 |- | 7 | Tamworth, New South Wales | 44,970 |- | 8 | Albury, New South Wales | 44,787 |- | 9 | Port Macquarie, New South Wales | 42,042 |- | 10 | Orange, New South Wales | 37,333 |- | 11 | Queanbeyan, New South Wales | 36,331 |- | 12 | Dubbo, New South Wales | 36,150 |- | 13 | Nowra, New South Wales-Bomaderry, New South Wales | 32,556 |- | 14 | Bathurst, New South Wales | 32,385 |- | 15 | Lismore, New South Wales | 31,865 |} == Gallery == Image:Sydney from Taronga Zoo.jpg|The City of Sydney seen from Taronga Park Zoo Image:RAS 01.JPG|The Sydney Royal Easter show is a popular annual event.
