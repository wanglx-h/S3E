Two of his best-known songs are "I Saw The Light" and "Hello It's Me". Both were on his 1971 album ''Something/Anything?''. Most of the songs on that album were performed by Rundgren alone, using multitrack recordings and playing many musical instruments. Apple Records hired Rundgren to produce an album, ''Straight Up'', for the band Badfinger during 1971. Badfinger had not heard of Rundgren and did not know his music, until they bought copies of some of his records. They liked what they heard, and when Rundgren met the band, they got along well, and worked well together. In the early 2000s, Rundgren replaced Ric Ocasek as bandleader of The Cars, when they reunited to tour. Actress Liv Tyler used to believe that Rundgren was her father. ==References== Category:1948 births Category:Living people Category:American record producers Category:American rock guitarists Category:American rock singers Category:American singer-songwriters Category:Singers from Pennsylvania
