Image:Kochendes wasser02.jpg A '''chemical substance''' is any material with a known chemical composition.Hill, J. W.; Petrucci, R. H.; McCreary, T. W.; Perry, S. S. ''General Chemistry'', 4th ed., p5, Pearson Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, 2005. For example, Water (molecule) has the same properties and the same ratio of hydrogen to oxygen whether it came from a river or was made in a laboratory. Typical chemical substances found in the home include water, salt and bleach. Generally, substances exist as a solid, a liquid, or a gas, and may change between these ''phase (matter)'' when there are changes in temperature or pressure. ==Gallery== File:Silizium pulver.jpg|Gray silicon powder, an element.
