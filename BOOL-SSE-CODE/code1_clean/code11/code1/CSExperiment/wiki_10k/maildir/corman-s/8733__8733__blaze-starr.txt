In the 1950s, she became well known in the United States. Besides her burlesque dance, her affair with Governor Earl Long of the U.S. state of Louisiana got her more popularity. ==Early life== Starr was born in rural Wayne County, West Virginia. She lived in Washington, D.C. and in Baltimore, Maryland during her youth. ==Affair with the Governor== When Blaze Starr first met Governor Long in 1958, her first feeling was fear. She was afraid she was going to prison when the Governor of Louisiana walked in with the police during a dance. When the Governor and the police gave Blaze a standing ovation, she was dumbfounded. Blaze had never known a politician who went to a show bar for any reason other than to cause the dancers trouble. After her show, the Governor asked for her to come to his Table (furniture). They became friends. Their Interpersonal relationship quickly grew into a love affair. Soon coworkers, reporters, and voters all knew of the affair. Mrs. Blanche Long, the Governor's wife, told hospital people that Earl was crazy and had him put away. She thought this would make Earl end the affair with Blaze. The affair continued until the day Earl died in 1960. Her life was exciting and full of adventures. In the 1950s, stripping was more of an art form. It was not just women taking off their clothing to get men into bed. Blaze was close to her family. Blaze met her perfect match when she met Earl. He accepted her life style and she accepted his. They fulfilled each other's needs for companionship, compassion, and love. ==Death== Starr died on June 15, 2015 at her home in Wilsondale, West Virginia. She was 83 years old. She had been worried about the health of her dog, whom she adopted as a stray. Her sister, Cathy Fleming, believed this stress, along with a "severe heart condition", killed her. Her dog died hours later. ==References== ==Other websites== *[http://www.blazestarrsgems.com/ Blaze Star Gems] (official site) * Category:1932 births Category:2015 deaths Category:Actors from West Virginia Category:American adult models Category:Comedians from West Virginia Category:American erotic dancers Category:Disease-related deaths in West Virginia Category:Deaths from heart disease
