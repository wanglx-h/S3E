File:Kinship (english).jpg An '''uncle''' is a name used in an extended family. An uncle is either a brother of one of someone's parents. That person is the uncle's nephew (male) or niece (female). An uncle's child is a cousin.''The Utah Genealogical and Historical Magazine; Volumes 7-9'', Vol. vii, ed. Anthon Henrik Lund (Salt Lake City, UT: The Genealogical Society of Utah, 1916), p. 179 A :en:wikt:granduncle (also written as great-uncle or grand-uncle) is the brother of a :wikt:grandparent. In some cultures an uncle is considered a close family member. Based on the old China saying "the oldest son in the family is the father of the family" an uncle is often the head of a family.Sonia M. Chen, ''China Changing in My Eyes: People, Schools and Landscapes'' (Bloomington, IN: Authorhouse, 2010), p. 49 In many cultures no single word (such as uncle) describes both their parents' brothers. Instead there are words to describe a person's kinship to their mother's brother or a person's kinship to their father's brother. An uncle can also be someone not related by blood or marriage as in a term of :wikt:endearment or respect. In this use uncle can also be part of a nickname such as Uncle Sam. ==''Avunculus''== During the Middle Ages in western Europe, a :wikt:maternal uncle played a particular role in the family. A young man was often closer to his maternal uncle (from or "little grandfather") than to his own father.Thomas Montgomery, ''Medieval Spanish Epic'' (University Park, PA: The Pennsylvania State University Press, 1998), p. 67 Tacitus noted the Franks had very strong ties between a maternal uncle and his nephew.David Herlihy, ''Medieval Households'' (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1985), p. 54 In Roman family relationships the ''avunculus'' had a :wikt:responsibility to defend his nephews as well as his nieces. The maternal uncle relationship was an extension of the Roman kin system's strong brother-sister relationship.''Growing Up Fatherless in Antiquity'', eds. Sabine R. Hübner; David M. Ratzan (Cambridge; New York: Cambridge University Press, 2009), 227 ===Variation of terms=== A maternal or paternal relative is one who is related through their mother or father, respectively. For example, a maternal uncle is the subject's mother's brother.An in-law is a relationship that is not by blood, but instead by marriage.

For example, an uncle in-law could be the husband of the subject's Aunt. * '''uncle''': parent's brother. * '''maternal uncle''': mother's brother. * '''paternal uncle''': father's brother. * '''half-uncle''': parent's half-brother. * '''double-half-brother''': a person who is a half-brother of both of the subjects parents. * '''granduncle''' (or '''great-uncle'''): grandparent's brother. * '''great-granduncle''' (or '''great-great-uncle'''): great-grandparent's brother. * '''uncle-in-law''': uncle/aunt's husband. * '''uncle-in-law''': spouse's uncle. * '''co-uncle-in-law''': spouse's uncle/aunt's husband. * '''stepuncle''': stepparent's brother. * '''stepuncle''': parent's stepbrother. ==Related pages== * Nephew and niece ==References== Category:Family
