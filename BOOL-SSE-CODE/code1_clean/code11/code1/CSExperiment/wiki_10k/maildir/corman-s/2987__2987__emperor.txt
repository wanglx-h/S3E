An '''emperor''' (female equivalent: '''empress''') is a male who rules an empire. The word is taken from the Latin language ''Imperator''. Often it is Capitalization. A woman who comes to power in an empire is called an empress. The wife of an emperor is also called an empress. An emperor or empress is often a Hereditary monarchy and comes to power when one of his parents, or relatives, death. In some countries, people elected a new emperor from candidates. The only emperor in the world today is the Emperor of Japan (''tennō''), but he lacks political power. The true leaders of Japan are the Diet of Japan and Prime Minister of Japan because the country is a Parliament constitutional monarchy. The English language word comes from Latin, the language of the old Roman Empire. At first, an ''imperator'' was a powerful general officer (army leader) but, after Augustus, it was only used by their emperor of Rome. There have been many countries in history whose leaders are called "emperors" in English. The leaders of the Byzantine Empire (''Byzantine emperor'', ''Byzantine emperor'') in Greece, the Holy Roman Empire (''Holy Roman Emperor'', ''Holy Roman Emperor'') in Austrian Empire and German Empire, Russian Empire, Serbia , and Bulgaria (''tsar''), and the Ottoman Empire (''sultan'', ''padishah'', ''khagan'', ''kaysar'') in Turkey all said they were just new parts of the old Roman Empire. The leaders of other countries who said they ruled the Earth or called themselves "King of Kings" are frequently also called emperors in English language. For example, the old rulers of China (''Emperor of China''), Iran (''Shah''), and Ethiopia (''Emperor of Ethiopia'') are all known as emperors in English language. There have also been emperors of Emperor of the French, Empire of Brazil , and First Mexican Empire, and the rulers of the United Kingdom called themselves the Emperors and empresses of India for a while. == Countries ruled by Emperor == * Empire of China (1915–1916) (221 BC – 1911, 1915–1916) * Ethiopian Empire (1137– 1975) * Japan (The only empire that currently exists) * Ottoman Empire (Türkiye, Anatolia, Balkans, Caucasus, Aegean and Mediterranean, Middle East, Arabian Peninsula, North Africa) 1299-1923 * Roman Empire (27 BC – 476) ** Byzantine Empire (395–1453) *** Latin Empire (1204–1261) *** Empire of Nicaea (1204–1261) *** Empire of Trebizond (1204–1461) *** Empire of Thessalonica (1224–1246) ** Western Roman Empire (395–476) *** Carolingian Empire (800–843) *** Holy Roman Empire (962–1806) * Russian Empire (1721–1917) * Empire of Vietnam (1802–1945) * Second French Empire (1804–1814, 1815, 1852–1870) * First Empire of Haiti (1804–1806, 1849–1859) * Austrian Empire (1804–1867) * Empire of Brazil (1822–1889) * German Empire (1871–1918) * Second Mexican Empire (1821–1823, 1864–1867) * British Raj (1858–1947) ** Mughal Empire (1526–1858) * Korean Empire (1897–1910) * Manchukuo (1934–1945) * Central African Empire (1976–1979) * Inca Empire (1438–1533) ==Related pages== *King *Czar *Kaiser *Sultan *Leader Category:Emperors and empresses
