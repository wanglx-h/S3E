Its capital is St. George's, Grenada. == History == Before it was discovered, Grenada was inhabited by indigenous people. In 1649, it was colonised by France. Over a century later in 1763, Grenada was given to the United Kingdom. In 1974, Grenada became an independent country led by List of heads of government of Grenada Eric Gairy. In 1983, Grenada was invaded by the United States in an effort to stop communism on the island. In 2004, a hurricane named Hurricane Ivan destroyed most of the island's resources. Grenada is called the '''Spice Island''' on account of its most famous export, the nutmeg. == Politics == Grenada is a monarchy with Charles III as king. Grenada has a parliament made up of a senate (13 seats) and a House of Representatives (15 seats). The senators are appointed by the representatives, who are elected by the people. ==Related pages== * Grenada at the Olympics * Grenada national football team * List of Grenadian people * List of rivers of Grenada * List of subdivisions of Grenada ==References== == Other websites == * [http://www.gov.gd Official Government Website] * [http://grenadagrenadines.com/ Official Website of the Tourism Board] * [http://www.travelgrenada.com General Tourism Website] Category:Grenada Category:Current monarchies Category:Caribbean Community Category:English-speaking countries Category:Commonwealth realms Category:1974 establishments in North America
