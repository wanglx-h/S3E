They can make Cabinet (furniture), build houses, or do other things with wood. Carpenters are always adding to their tools and always learning how to use the new tools, materials, and ways of working with wood. Many carpenters will choose to focus their skills in one of two broad ranging categories. Rough carpenters will focus on building things that need to be simple and structural. This includes framing for houses, or crates for shipping. Finish carpenters will focus on things that are detailed and artistic. For example, they can be furniture builders, Cabinet making or toy makers. Wood carvers are sometimes counted as carpenters. == Related pages == * Cabinet making == References == Category:Construction occupations
