The capital (city) of Newfoundland and Labrador is St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador. In 2021, 510,550 people lived in Newfoundland and Labrador. Newfoundland is an island, while Labrador, Canada is within the mainland of Canada and on a border with Quebec. ==History== The province of Newfoundland and Labrador was originally called Newfoundland and joined Canada in 1949, becoming the newest province of Canada, after being a colony of the United Kingdom. Until an agreement was reached in 1927, Quebec also claimed Labrador. In 2001, the name of Newfoundland changed to its new official name, Newfoundland and Labrador, while the postal code abbreviation changed from '''NF''' to '''NL'''. The island of Newfoundland, and part of Labrador, are in a time zone that is a half hour off from any other part of North America. ==References== Category:Newfoundland and Labrador Category:1949 establishments in Canada
