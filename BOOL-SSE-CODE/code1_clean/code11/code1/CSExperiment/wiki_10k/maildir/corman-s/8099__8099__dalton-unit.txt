The '''dalton''' or '''unified atomic mass unit''', abbreviated as '''u''', '''amu''' or '''John Dalton#Dalton's atomic theory''') is a unit of measurement for Measurement the Atomic mass, equalling ¹⁄₁₂ of the mass of the carbon-12 isotope, the most Abundance of chemical elements form of carbon atoms in nature. * * * ==History== The unit is named after English people chemist and physicist John Dalton (1766 – 1844). 1 atomic mass unit is Approximation 1.66 Multiplication 10-27 Kilogram, or 1.66 Multiplication 10-24 Gram.
