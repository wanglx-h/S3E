'''Dharma''' (or '''dhamma''') is a concept that is part of many religions or spiritual beliefs that originated in the Indian subcontinent. It means ''the law'' of spiritual growth of believers. Indian religions like Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism all believe in Dharma and are hence also known as Dharmic religions. ==In Buddhism== In Buddhism, the word "Dharma" also means the very old teachings of Gautama Buddha. For example, The Four Noble Truths. ==In Hinduism== In Hinduism, dharma is the spiritual law for human beings. It is the way of goodness, truth and duty. For example, a child's dharma is to be a good student. Parents’ dharma is to raise and support their family. A teacher’s dharma is to teach, and the dharma of the police is to protect others. Each age brings new responsibilities, so dharma will change over your lifetime. It is everyone’s dharma to be honest, kind and religious, to do no harm to others and to be a good citizen. Hindus believe that following dharma fulfills the highest purpose on earth. When people follow dharma, they feel good about themselves.''Saivite Hindu Religion, Book Four for Children Ages 8 to 10'' ==References== Category:Indian religions
