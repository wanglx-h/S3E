Subject: Provinces and territories of Canada
File:Political map of Canada.png Canada is a country and sovereign state in the north of North America. It is made up of thirteen administrative divisions: ten provinces and three territory. The different levels of government in Canada are based on the principles of a federation: the governments of each province and territory share power with the Government of Canada. The territories' governments have a more limited set of powers than the federal government. The provinces are in the south of Canada, near the border with the United States. They go from the Atlantic Ocean in the east to the Pacific Ocean in the west. The territories are to the north, where fewer people live, close to the Arctic Circle and Arctic Ocean. Here is a list of the provinces and territories, and their standard abbreviations, with their capital citys (the cities where their governments are based) and largest city. Canada's national capital, where the federal government meets, is Ottawa. {| class="wikitable" style="font-size:90%;text-align:left;" |- !bgcolor=#00000|Province name !bgcolor=#efefef|Abbreviation !bgcolor=#efefef|Capital city !bgcolor=#efefef|Largest city (if not the capital) |- |Alberta |AB |Edmonton |Calgary |- |British Columbia |BC |Victoria, British Columbia |Vancouver |- |Manitoba |MB |Winnipeg | |- |New Brunswick |NB |Fredericton |Moncton |- |Newfoundland and Labrador |NL |St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador | |- |Nova Scotia |NS |Halifax, Nova Scotia | |- |Ontario |ON |Toronto | |- |Prince Edward Island |PE |Charlottetown | |- |Quebec |QC |Quebec City |Montreal |- |Saskatchewan |SK |Regina, Saskatchewan |Saskatoon |- !bgcolor=#efefef|Territory name !bgcolor=#efefef|Abbreviation !bgcolor=#efefef|Capital city !bgcolor=#efefef|Largest city (if not the capital) |- |Yukon |YT |Whitehorse | |- |Nunavut |NU |Iqaluit | |- |Northwest Territories |NT |Yellowknife | |} Category:Provinces and territories of Canada Category:Canada geography-related lists
