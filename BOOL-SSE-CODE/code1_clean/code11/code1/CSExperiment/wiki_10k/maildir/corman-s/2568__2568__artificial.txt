Subject: Artificial
When something is '''artificial''', or '''man-made''', it has been made by humans, not nature. For example, an satellite (artificial) is one made by humans, while a Satellite (natural) is a satellite that was not made by humans. Many artificial things wikt:imitate or wikt:copy#Verb things found in nature. The imitation may use the same basic materials like those in the natural object, or it may use quite different materials like in artificial leather. They are concepts in defining reality. There are different ideas about what can be considered artificial and what is natural. The word "artificial" comes from the Latin words ''art'' (meaning "skill") and ''fex'' ("to make"). Artificial does not necessarily mean wikt:synthetic (meaning created by Chemical synthesis). An artificial sweetener imitates Sweet (taste) by using a chemical formula that is not found in nature. That makes it both artificial and synthetic. Some Disaster are natural, but some are man-made like the Dust Bowl in the United States. ==References== ==Related pages== * *Artifact (disambiguation) *Ontology Category:Technology Category:Anthropology
