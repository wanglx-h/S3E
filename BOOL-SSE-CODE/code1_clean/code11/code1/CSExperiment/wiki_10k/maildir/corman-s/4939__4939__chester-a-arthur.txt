Before becoming president, he was most noted as the Collector of Tariff for the Port of New York and New Jersey, a job he got from his political friendships. Arthur was the first president of the United States to take oath of office at his own house. Arthur was a lawyer in New York City. Two of his cases were famous. One confirmed that any slave brought to New York was automatically set free. The other ended the racial segregation of streetcars in the city. After President James A. Garfield died, Vice President of the United States Chester Arthur replaced him. The man who killed him expected the new president to pardon him. This did not happen. During Arthur's term a major problem was that politicians were appointing their friends (such as himself) to high political offices instead of people who were most qualified to do the job. The problem was solved after he promoted the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act which required people to pass tests before they could be appointed to a public job. == References == == Other websites == *[http://www.whitehouse.gov/history/presidents/ca21.html Arthur's White House biography] Category:1830 births Category:1886 deaths Category:Deaths from stroke Category:Republican Party (United States) politicians Category:Chester A.
