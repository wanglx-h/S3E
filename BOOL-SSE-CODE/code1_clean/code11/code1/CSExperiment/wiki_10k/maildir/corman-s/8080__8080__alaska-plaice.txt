Subject: Alaska plaice
'''Alaska plaice''' (''Pleuronectes quadrituberculatus'') are salt water fish that live in the north Pacific Ocean. Like most flatfish, they live on the bottom of the continental shelf, up to 600 metres deep. Their geography range is from the Gulf of Alaska in the east, to the Chukchi Sea in the north, to the Sea of Japan in the west. Alaska plaice feed mostly on polychaetes, but also eat amphipodas and echiurans. Most commercial fishery do not want to catch Alaska plaice; but many are caught by trawlers trying to catch other bottom fish. So many Alaska plaice get caught anyway that, for example, the 2005 total allowable catch in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI) was reached before the end of May of that year. Alaska plaice can live for up to 30 years, and grow to 60 metre (24 inches) long, but most that get caught are only seven or eight years old, and about 30cm (12in). ==Related pages== *American plaice *European Plaice ==References== *[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3089/is_4_60/ai_60591421 1998 Marine Fisheries Review article] *[http://www.fakr.noaa.gov/index/infobulletins/bulletin.asp?BulletinID=1088 Bulletin announcing reaching the total allowable catch of Alaska plaice for 2005] (National Marine Fisheries Service) Category:Flatfish
