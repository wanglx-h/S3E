Whales, dolphins and porpoises are part of this group. These common names refer to size: whales are the largest, porpoises the smallest. How and what they eat is a better guide to their relationships. The study of cetaceans is called cetology. Cetaceans are ocean creatures without toes, but are classified in the related order Cetartiodactyla because their ancestors were even toed ungulates. == Taxonomy == * Order '''Cetacea''' ** Suborder '''Mysticeti''': Baleen whales *** Family '''Balaenidae''': Right whales and Bowhead whale **** Bowhead whale, ''Balaena mysticetus'' **** Genus ''Eubalaena'': Right whales ***** North Atlantic right whale, ''Eubalaena glacialis'' ***** North Pacific right whale, ''Eubalaena japonica'' ***** Southern right whale, ''Eubalaena australis'' *** Family '''Balaenopteridae''': Rorquals **** Genus ''Balaenoptera'' ***** Blue whale, ''Balaenoptera musculus'' ***** Fin whale, ''Balaenoptera physalus'' **** Humpback whale, ''Megaptera novaeangliae'' *** Family '''Eschrichtiidae''' **** Gray whale, ''Eschrichtius robustus'' *** Family '''Neobalaenidae''' **** Pygmy right whale, ''Caperea marginata'' ** Suborder '''Odontoceti''': Toothed whales *** Family '''Delphinidae''': Oceanic dolphins *** Family '''Phocoenidae''': Porpoises *** Family '''Monodontidae''' **** Beluga whale, ''Delphinapterus leucas'' **** Narwhal, ''Monodon monoceros'' *** Family '''Physeteridae''': Sperm whales **** Sperm whale, ''Physeter catodon'' **** Dwarf sperm whale, ''Kogia sima'' **** Pygmy sperm whale, ''Kogia breviceps'' *** Family Ziphiidae **** Cuvier's beaked whale, ''Ziphia cavirostris'' *** Superfamily '''Platanistoidea''': River dolphins Category:Cetaceans
