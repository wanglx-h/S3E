He was the second son of Francis I and Claude of Brittany, and became Dauphin of France after his older brother, Francis, died in 1536. As a child, Henry and his brother were taken hostage by Spain for over four years as part of a treaty exchange for their father. During his reign, Henry continued many of his father’s policies, including promoting the arts and engaging in the Italian Wars against the Habsburgs. He also sought to suppress the Protestant Reformation in France, although the number of Huguenots (French Protestants) grew significantly during his rule. In 1559, Henry signed the Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis, which ended the long-running Italian Wars. Although France gave up its claims to Italian territories, it gained control of important areas like the Pale of Calais and the Three Bishoprics, which strengthened its borders. That same year, Henry was fatally injured in a jousting tournament, celebrating the peace treaty. His surgeon, Ambroise Paré, could not save him after a lance pierced his eye, and Henry died ten days later. Henry's death marked a period of instability for France. He left behind four sons, three of whom became kings, and his widow, Catherine de' Medici, who served as regent. However, the weak reigns of his sons and Catherine’s unpopular regency contributed to the outbreak of the French Wars of Religion between Catholics and Protestants. This period ultimately led to the decline of the Valois dynasty.
