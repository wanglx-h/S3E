The Qi (state) made a fortification wall for protection against the Southern states Ju and Lu and later from the kingdom Chu. Yan (state) built walls during the rule of King Zhao of Yan (311–279 BC).Di Cosmo 2002, pp. 142–43. The Zhao (state) built walls during 325–299 BC, during the rule of king Wuling of Zhao. === Qin dynasty === The First Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang also called Shi Huangdi, started the Qin Dynasty. The Xiongnu tribes in the north of China were his enemies. The land in some parts of China is easy to cross, so Qin Shi Huang started building the Great Wall to make it more difficult for the Xiongnu to invade China. The most famous part of the Great Wall was built between 226 and 200 BC by the first Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang (Qin Pronounced as Chin), during the Qin Dynasty. Walls on the periphery of the Northern states Yan, Zhao, and Qin became linked together, because all those states came under the rule of emperor Qin Shi Huang during his rule (221–206 BC).Di Cosmo 2002, p. 139. By 212 BC, the wall went from Gansu to the coast of South Manchuria. === Expansion === Other dynasty in China continued to build and lengthen the Great Wall. The Han, Sui, Northern and Jin Dynasties all repaired, rebuilt or expanded it. Their goal was to protect China from Mongols Invasion from the north.

Some parts of the wall were made of mud, straw, and twigs. Thousands of workers died from giant falling stones, exhaustion, disease, animal attacks, and starvation. The idea that workers died and were buried in and under the Great Wall is a myth.Paul and Bernice Noll's Window on the World. ''History of The Great Wall of China''. [http://www.paulnoll.com/China/Tourism/history-Great-Wall-3-defense.html] == Visibility from space == A astronaut named William Pogue was able to see the wall from a Low Earth Orbit (300–530km above Earth), but only with binoculars and a lot of practice. Another astronaut, Neil Armstrong, said that on the Moon, it was very clear that the wall was not visible. The Great Wall has shown up in some photos taken from space, but scientists are sure it is not possible for astronauts to see the wall without binoculars. ==Gallery== File:"The First Mound"--the west end of the Great Wall.jpg|The First Mound at the Jiayuguan Pass Pass in Gansu The Journey of Discovery Beijing (6962643268).jpg|Near Jiayuguan 明长城 - panoramio (1).jpg|Near Yinchuan in Ningxia 榆林市的明长城遗迹 - panoramio.jpg|In Yulin, Shaanxi GreatWall 2004 Summer 1A.jpg|In Badaling's Yanqing District in Beijing File:Juyongguan Great Wall.jpg|In the Juyongguan area of Beijing File:Gubeikou Gate.jpg|The gate at the wall in Gubeikou, Beijing File:Great Wall at Simatai overlooking gorge.jpg|In Simatai, Beijing File:MutianyuGreatWallWildSection.JPG|In Mutianyu, Beijing File:Great wall stops in see.jpg|At Shanhaiguan File:Great Wall of China.jpeg|At Badaling in 1979 == Sources == * Di Cosmo, Nicola (1999).
