===September 2006=== * I found clear and convincing evidence by looking at both his simple: and en: contributions on all accounts that User:ForestH2 has other secondary accounts (sockpuppets) user:Treebark and user:Carmelapple. As he recently used these and two other newly-created accounts to vote for himself in an adminship request, I've blocked them all. -- User:Netoholic User talk:Netoholic 04:51, 21 September 2006 (UTC) ** I would like to back Netoholic's decision here. I too have investigated and it would appear that he did use sockpuppets. User:Billz (User talk:Billz) 06:28, 21 September 2006 (UTC) ** UPDATE: see :en:Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/ForestH2. With this confirmation, User:ForestH2 should now be considered banned from Simple, for using sockpuppets to attempt to gain adminship. He will likely attempt to create yet more accounts. -- User:Netoholic User talk:Netoholic 02:19, 22 September 2006 (UTC) *Can someone watch Special:Recentchanges and revert any page-blanking vandalism that any user does. Were getting a lot right now. User:ForestH2User talk:ForestH2 00:37, 13 September 2006 (UTC) * The people at the commons decided to replace the PNG version of the commons logo with a big red "X". Most of the templates which still have the "X" are protected. can someone please replace them with :Image:Commons-logo.svg? --User:LBMixProUser talk:LBMixProWP:EAUser talk:LBMixPro 07:02, 1 September 2006 (UTC) * There are some changes that I would like made to MediaWiki:Edittools, detailed at MediaWiki talk:Edittools. Can an administrator please take a look at this issue? Thanks, User:Tangotango 07:19, 2 September 2006 (UTC) *Can someone please check Talk:Main Page regarding other project numbers, etc.? And the logo for English Wiktionary should be changed since the image name has changed. --User:CromwelltWikipedia:EsperanzaUser:Cromwellt|User talk:Cromwellt|Special:Contributions/Cromwellt 17:35, 12 September 2006 (UTC) *This is a reminder to all sysops that the :Category:Possible copyright violations category should be regularly pruned. Some of the articles in there have been tagged for quite some time. Keeping copyright violations on-wiki casts a bad image of simplewiki and is potentially dangerous, so please keep an eye on that category if you can. Thank you, User:Tangotango 17:13, 3 October 2006 (UTC) ===July 2006=== *'''Changes to the blocking system.''' We can now block anonymous users from IPs, but leave logged-in users. We can also stop account creation from blocked IPs. Take a look on Special:Blockip. User:Archer7 | User talk:Archer7 22:53, 15 July 2006 (UTC) *User:Miagop now claims to be the good Reri Horlockon, and that the account was hacked by the vandal, which would make sense. Investigating. User:Archer7 | User talk:Archer7 00:07, 6 July 2006 (UTC) *Image undeletion is now active if anyone hasn't noticed. User:Archer7 | User talk:Archer7 22:57, 3 July 2006 (UTC) ===June 2006=== User:Reri Horlockon has admitted to being the 63.19 vandal. Can't say I'm that surprised, more impressed that a vandal would spend so much time vandalising himself. Has promised to continue vandalising under sockpuppets. User:Archer7 | User talk:Archer7 10:19, 10 June 2006 (UTC) ===May 2006=== * User:Netoholic has been blocked for 24 hours for being rude towards User:Cromwellt and removing references to Simple Wiktionary without discussion despite community consensus. User:Archer7 | User talk:Archer7 09:43, 27 May 2006 (UTC) *User:Pg2114 (also User:Timark uk) has made a return under the username User:Gouldpeter. This account has constructive edits, but this is the same game that was played before. The account has been blocked indefinitely. Watch out for variations on this, he was operating on a dynamic IP last time I checked. User:Archer7 16:47, 11 May 2006 (UTC) === April 2006 === * Banned user User:Mariusz Marcel Ernst previously used 'Ghoul' as a username. A User:NCCGhoul has recently been created soon after User:NCCschool with all constructive edits, but I'm suspicious. Impostor or good user? User:Archer7 20:16, 9 May 2006 (UTC) * Does anyone have any idea what's going on with the new usernames that are being created with random numbers. See the user creation log to see what I mean, none of them are contributing. User:Archer7 16:23, 27 April 2006 (UTC) :* We should get a steward to authorized a check user to see if they might be coming from the same or similar IPs. The name is not substantive and should probably be blocked with a message asking the user request name change from a bcrat. -- User:Psy guy 16:43, 27 April 2006 (UTC) ::They violate en's Wikipedia:Username, I'm blocking the following infinitely: ::User:206501450 ::User:206501155 ::User:206509061 ::User:206501925 ::User:206500369 User:Archer7 16:08, 28 April 2006 (UTC) === July 2005 === * User:Roberto goes on a fairly long vandalism spree, mostly consisting of changing the Main Page to add some unpopular images and is then blocked indefinitely. === April 2005 === * User:Mariusz Marcel Ernst returned to intentionally contribute more nonsense and was blocked indefinitely. Much of it was the creation of one line page creations which were deleted. === October 2004 === * User:SimonMayer is promoted to meta:Bureaucrat status, replacing User:Angela. === September 2004 === * Former admin User:Tim Starling decided to desysop himself here, and on other wikis, where he is not active. === August 2004 === * 16 August - User:Anonyme page deleted. === April 2004 === * User:Tango becomes Simple's eighth administrator. * One user is repeatedly Wikipedia:Block log for Wikipedia:vandalism in progress, primarily to Angela's user pages. * User:Anonyme is not a user, but a page being borrowed by the French Wikipedia so they can sort out one of their policies without interference from a problematic user on fr. They have asked sysops here not to delete it for a few days while they work on it. === March 2004 === * Optim appears to have quit Wikipedia and is replaced by two new sysops: SimonMayer and Mero. === January 2004 === * A user calling himself Mariusz Marcel Ernst, the master, was banned multiple times for vandalism and Wikipedia:copyrights violations. Later, the whole range was blocked. This block was removed in February. * The Wikipedia:deletion policy and Wikipedia:protection policy were written.
