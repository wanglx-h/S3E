A '''mushroom''' (also called a '''toadstool''') is the part of a fungus that is comparable to the fruit of a plant. Unlike plants, mushrooms do not photosynthesis to generate energy for themselves. Some mushrooms are edible, and are used for cooking in many countries, such as China, Korean cuisine and Europe. Other mushrooms, however, are poisonous, and can cause severe illness or death if eaten. People who search for edible mushrooms are called ''mycophagists'', meaning "mushroom eater", while the act itself is called "mushrooming". Mushrooms have been known to support bone health and to regulate blood sugar in diabetics. It is available in different colours and shapes. == Kinds of mushrooms == File:Mushroom in Swedish forest 9.jpg * Amanita (includes very poisonous, and hallucinogenic kinds) * Boletus (includes poisonous and edible kinds) * Chanterelles (edible) * Coral fungi (usually edible) * Cap fungi (usually edible) [citation needed] * Jelly fungus (usually edible) * Bracket fungus (similar to boletes) * Psychedelic mushroom (also known as shrooms) * Puffballs (usually edible) * Stinkhorns (usually edible, but has a stench) * Tooth fungi == Structure of mushrooms == Most mushrooms have a stem and a cap.
