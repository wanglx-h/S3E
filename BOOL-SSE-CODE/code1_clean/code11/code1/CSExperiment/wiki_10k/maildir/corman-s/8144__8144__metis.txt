Subject: Metis
'''Metis''' is the goddess of wisdom in Greek mythology. She is one of the Titans and is the daughter of Oceanus and Tethys (mythology). She was the mother of Athena. There is also a moon named after Metis. When she was inside Zeus, Metis made a helmet and a robe for her baby. The hammering noise caused Zeus to have a headache. To try and help Zeus with the pain, Prometheus, Hephaestus, Hermes, or Palaemon (depending on the myth) cut his head open with a Minoan axe. Athena then came out of Zeus's head. She was fully grown and had her armor on. ==Related pages== *Athena *9 Metis Category:Titans
