He spent much of his leisure time in the town, and had the Royal Pavilion built during the early part of his Regency era. The arrival of the London and Brighton Railway in 1841 brought Brighton within the reach of Day trip from London. Some major attractions such as the West Pier and the Brighton Palace Pier were built for the growing number of tourists. The population grew from around 7,000 in 1801 to more than 120,000 by 1901.
