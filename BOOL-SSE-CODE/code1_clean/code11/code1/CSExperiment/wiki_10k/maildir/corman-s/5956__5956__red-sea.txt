File:Red_Sea_37.95521E_21.41271N.jpg File:RedSeaEgyptReef.jpg The '''Red Sea''' is a sea between the Arabian Peninsula of Asia in the northeast and Africa in the southwest. It is a part of the Indian Ocean. The Red Sea is about 2200km long and less than 330km wide. Many ships go through the Red Sea because the Suez Channel at the north end connects the Red Sea to the Mediterranean Sea. Bab-el-Mandeb in the south is a gate to the Indian Ocean. Ports include Suez, Port Sudan, Massawa, Yanbu al-Bahr, Jeddah, Aqaba and Eilat. The Red Sea has that name because it sometimes looks red from the red algae. The water has more salt and is clearer than water of most other seas because almost no rivers run into it. The climate is dry and warm the whole year. Many people, including those from Europe, like to vacation there during the winter. Some of them are scuba diving and want to see the beautiful coral reefs and fish. Seaside resorts include Sharm el-Sheikh, Eilat or Hurghada. == Geography == The country next to the Red Sea are Egypt, Sudan, Eritrea, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Israel. In the book of Exodus, God parted it for Moses and the Israelites so they could escape from the Egypt. == References == Category:Seas of the Indian Ocean
