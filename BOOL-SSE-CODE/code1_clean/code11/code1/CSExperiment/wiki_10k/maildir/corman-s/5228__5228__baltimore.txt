In 2020 it had about 585,708 people living there. It is not in any county, so it is called an independent city. It is next to the Chesapeake Bay and used to be an important Harbour for trade by ships. There is still some shipping but the Inner Harbor is now mostly famous for shopping and restaurants, and also for the National Aquarium and other museums. Baltimore is home to the Baltimore Ravens (American football) and Baltimore Orioles (baseball), both professional sports teams. Its main newspaper is the ''Baltimore Sun.'' There is a place for horse Racing in the city called Pimlico. There are many colleges and university in Baltimore, like Johns Hopkins University. The city was made in 1729 and is named after the British Lord Baltimore who started the colony of Maryland. The mayor of the city as of 2020 is Brandon Scott. Many governors of Maryland were mayor of Baltimore first. One famous thing that happened in Baltimore was in the War of 1812, when the British attacked the city and Francis Scott Key wrote a song about it called "The Star-Spangled Banner". It is now the national anthem of the United States. Some famous people from Baltimore are the Supreme Court judge Thurgood Marshall, the poet and writer Edgar Allen Poe (he lived in the city but was not born there), the baseball player Babe Ruth, the singer Billie Holiday, and the movie movie director John Waters. == History == In 1706, the colony of Maryland's General Assembly created the Port of Baltimore at Locust Point, Baltimore. It was built for tobacco trade. The Town of Baltimore was founded on July 30, 1729. It was named after Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore, the British Lord Baltimore. Calvert was the first Proprietary Governor of the Province of Maryland. Baltimore grew quickly in the 1700s as a granary (place for storing cereals and grains) for the sugar plantations in the Caribbean. File:Balt Battle Monument 1a.jpg.]] Baltimore was important in the time leading up to the American Revolution. Leaders like Jonathan Plowman Jr. got the city to refuse to pay taxes to Britain. Merchants (people who buy and sell things) signed agreements to not trade with Britain. The Second Continental Congress met in the Henry Fite House from December 1776 to February 1777. This made Baltimore the List of capitals in the United States during this time. In 1796, after the war, the Town of Baltimore, nearby Jonestown, Baltimore, and an area called Fells Point, Baltimore were wikt:incorporate as the City of Baltimore. (This means that these areas all merged and became the City of Baltimore.) The city was a part of Baltimore County, Maryland until 1851. It then became an Independent city (United States). During the War of 1812, the Battle of Baltimore happened in the city. The British attacked Baltimore on the night of September 13, 1814. This was right after they Burning of Washington. United States soldiers from Fort McHenry defense (military) the Inner Harbor. Francis Scott Key watched the battle from a British ship in the harbor. He wrote the poem "The Star-Spangled Banner" about the attack. Later, "The Star-Spangled Banner" became the official National Anthem of the United States. File:Harpers 8 11 1877 6th Regiment Fighting Baltimore.jpg After the war, the number of people who lived in the city grew quickly. The National Road (now part of U.S. Route 40) and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O) connected the city with big markets in the Midwestern United States. This made Baltimore a very important shipping and manufacturing center. Baltimore was nicknamed "the Monumental City" by President of the United States John Quincy Adams in 1827. During an event, Adams toast (honor) and said: "Baltimore: the Monumental City – [m]ay the days of her safety be as prosperous and happy, as the days of her dangers have been trying and triumphant." In 1835, the Baltimore bank riots happened. These were one of the worst riots of the antebellum Southern United States. (The ''antebellum'' period is the time right before the American Civil War.) During the American Civil War, Maryland did not secede from the Union. (That is, Maryland stayed a part of the Union (American Civil War) and did not join the Confederate States of America.) When Union soldiers marched through the city at the start of the war, some people attacked the soldiers. This started the Baltimore riot of 1861. Four soldiers and 12 civilians were killed. After the riot, Union soldiers occupy (stayed in) Baltimore. During the war, Maryland was governed directly by the federal government and the state government did not have any power. This was to keep the state from seceding (leaving the Union). After the war ended in April 1865, Maryland began governing itself again. During the 1870s there was an economic depression called the "Panic of 1873." After the Panic, the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad company decided to pay its workers less. This caused the Great Railroad Strike of 1877. These strikes stopped train service in Cumberland, Maryland in western Maryland. On July 20, 1877, the Maryland Governor, John Lee Carroll, ordered the Maryland Army National Guard to stop the strikes. People who supported the railroad workers attacked the national guard soldiers. Soldiers from the 6th Regiment fired their guns at the crowd. 10 people were killed, and 25 people were hurt. This started a riot. Trains were damaged and parts of Camden Station were burned. US Army soldiers came to Baltimore to protect the railroad and end the strike. The riot and strike ended on July 21–22, 1877. File:Baltimore Fire 1904 - West from Pratt and Gay Streets 3a.jpg of 1904, a lot of the city was destroyed. This is a view of downtown looking west from Pratt and Gay Street (Baltimore).]] The Great Baltimore Fire started on February 7, 1904. It burned for 30 hours and destroyed 1,500 buildings. More than 70 city block of downtown burned to the ground. The fire caused about $150 million of damage (US$ }} million in .) The city grew bigger by annexing (absorbing) suburbs from nearby county. The last suburb was added in 1918. The city added parts of Baltimore County and Anne Arundel County. In 1948, the state constitution was amendment (changed). It now required a special vote by citizens before an area could be added to the city. This stopped the expansion (growth) of the city. In 1950, the city was 23.8% black. By 1970, it was 46.4% black. After Martin Luther King, Jr. was murdered in Memphis, Tennessee on April 4, 1968, the Baltimore riot of 1968 started. It lasted until April 12, 1968. The riot cost the city about $10million (US$ }} million in ). During the riot, 11,000 Maryland National Guard soldiers and US Army soldiers tried to protect the city. It is possible to see some effects of the riots today. Parts of North Avenue (Baltimore), Howard Street (Baltimore), Gay Street (Baltimore), and Maryland Route 140 are barren, empty, and not taken care of. During the 1970s, Baltimore's downtown area, called the "Inner Harbor," was run down and neglected. It was full of empty and wikt:abandoned warehouses. The city began trying to reLand improvement the area. The Baltimore Convention Center was opened in 1979. Harborplace, a shopping and restaurant area, opened in 1980. The National Aquarium in Baltimore (Maryland's largest tourist destination) and the Baltimore Museum of Industry opened in 1981. In 1992, the Baltimore Orioles Major League Baseball moved from Memorial Stadium (Baltimore) to Oriole Park at Camden Yards near the harbor. Six years later the Baltimore Ravens National Football League moved into M&T Bank Stadium next to Camden Yards. The National Register of Historic Places lists 280 historical properties in Baltimore city. == Geography == File:Baltimoreharborview.jpg, looking east.]] File:Lucas Baltimore 1852 Cityplan.png of Baltimore.]] Baltimore is in north-central Maryland. It is on the Patapsco River, close to where it empties into the Chesapeake Bay. It is on the fall line between the Piedmont (United State) and the Atlantic coastal plain. (The ''fall line'' is a phrase in geology that means that this is a place where two different kinds of earth meet.) The fall line splits Baltimore into a "lower city" and "upper city." At the harbor, the city is at sea level. The highest point is near Pimlico, Baltimore in the northwest. There the elevation is . According to the 2020 census, the city has a total area of . This is of land and of water. The total area of Baltimore City is 12.1% water. === Climate === Baltimore is in the humid subtropical climate zone. July is usually the hottest month of the year. The average temperature in July is . Summer is usually very humid. The highest temperature on record is in 1936. January is the coldest month of the year. Sometimes wind from the subtropics brings Spring (season) weather during winter. At night, winds from the Arctic make temperatures drop into the teens (in Fahrenheit; less than -7 Celsius.) Some nights the temperature drops to the single digits (less than -12°C.) The coldest temperature on record is from 1934. Downtown Baltimore and the parts of the city that are on the coast are usually warmer than other parts of Baltimore. This is because of the urban heat island effect. Also the Chesapeake Bay acts to moderate the effects of temperature. This means that the water helps keep the temperature from changing greatly. Baltimore gets a lot of rain during the whole year. There is no "rainy season" or "dry season." This is normal in most cities on the East Coast of the United States. Every month, about of precipitation (rain, snow, sleet, etc.) falls in Baltimore. The total rainfall yearly average is around . There are usually about 105 sunny days in a year. There are lots of rain showers and thunderstorms during spring, summer, and autumn. In the winter, there are longer but lighter rain showers, and less sunshine and more clouds. It sometimes snows in the winter. The average snowfall is .NOAA, HKO idcide, intellicast, |date=August 2010 }} ==Cityscape== File:Baltimore Inner Harbor Panorama.jpg, seen from Federal Hill.]] File:Bmore-Skyline1.jpg === Architecture === File:Pier 5 and the Power Plant Building in SE Baltimore by D Ramey Logan.jpg File:BaltimoreNationalAquarium.JPG, one of the world's largest aquariums.]] Baltimore has architecture in every wikt:style from the last 200-plus years. Many famous architects have designed buildings in the city. Some of these architects are Benjamin Henry Latrobe, George A. Frederick, John Russell Pope, Mies Van Der Rohe and I. M. Pei. The city has some buildings that are thought to be important to the history of architecture. Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary (1806–1821) was designed by Benjamin Henry Latrobe in the neoclassical style. It is the oldest Roman Catholic Cathedral in the United States. The Municipal Museum of Baltimore, often called the Peale Museum, was build in 1813 by Robert Cary Long, Sr. It was built for Rembrandt Peale and is the first building in the United States designed specifically to be a museum. The McKim's School, built by Isaac McKim in 1822, shows the interest of early American architects in ancient Greece art. The Phoenix Shot Tower (1828) was the tallest building in the United States until the Civil War. It is tall. The tower was build without scaffolding. The Sun Iron Building (1851) was the first iron-front building. Brown Memorial Presbyterian Church (1870) has stained glass windows by Louis Comfort Tiffany. It has been called "one of the most significant buildings in this city, a treasure of art and architecture" by ''Baltimore Magazine''. The 1845 Greek Revival architecture style Lloyd Street Synagogue is one of the oldest synagogues in the United States. The Baltimore World Trade Center was built in 1977 by architect I.M. Pei. The building is in the shape of an equilateral pentagon (it has five equal sides.) It is the tallest building of this shape in the world. Oriole Park at Camden Yards is considered by many to be the most beautiful baseball park in Major League Baseball. It is designed to be "retro style". The park has inspired many other cities to build their own retro ballparks. Camden Yards and the National Aquarium in Baltimore have helped revive the Inner Harbor. The area used to be an industrial district of run-down and abandoned warehouses. Today it is a lively commerce district full of Bar (business), restaurants, and Shop. ===Tallest buildings=== File:Legg Mason Building.jpg is the tallest building in Baltimore.]] {| cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" style="margin: 0 1em 1em 0; font-size: 90%;" |- style="background:#ccc;" !Rank||Building||Height||Floors||Built|| |- |1 || Transamerica Tower (Baltimore) (formerly the Legg Mason Building) || || 40 || 1973 || |- style="background:#efefef;" |2 ||Bank of America Building (Baltimore) || || 37 || 1924 || |- |3 || William Donald Schaefer Building || || 37 || 1992 || |- style="background:#efefef;" |4 ||Commerce Place (Baltimore) || || 31 || 1992 || |- |5 || 100 East Pratt Street || || 28 || 1992 || |- style="background:#efefef;" |6 || Baltimore World Trade Center || || 28 || 1977 || |- |7 || Tremont Plaza Hotel || || 37 || 1967 || |- style="background:#efefef;" |8 || Charles Center || || 30 || 1969 || |- |9 || Blaustein Building || || 30 || 1962 || |- style="background:#efefef;" |10 || 250 West Pratt Street || || 24 || 1986 || |} ===Neighborhoods=== Baltimore is officially split into nine regions. These regions are based on geography. Each region is patrolled by their own Baltimore Police Department district. These regions are: Northern, Northwestern, Northeastern, Western, Central, Eastern, Southern, Southwestern, and Southeastern. Locals sometimes split the city into "East Baltimore" and "West Baltimore" along Maryland Route 139. Other locals sometimes split the city into "North Baltimore" and "South Baltimore" along Baltimore Street. The '''Central district''' includes Downtown Baltimore, Harborplace, The Camden Yards Sports Complex (Oriole Park at Camden Yards and M&T Bank Stadium), the Baltimore Convention Center, and the National Aquarium in Baltimore. It is the city's main commercial area. It also has many nightclubs, Bar (business), restaurants, shopping centers, and other attractions. Many of the city's key businesses are in this area as well. The University of Maryland, Baltimore campus, University of Maryland Medical System, Maryland Institute College of Art, the Peabody Institute of music, the Lyric Opera House, The Walters Art Museum, and The Joseph Meyerhoff Symphony Hall are also in the central district. The '''Northern District''' is north of the Central district. Loyola University Maryland, The Johns Hopkins University and College of Notre Dame of Maryland are in this district. Some of the richer residential neighborhoods are also here. The neighborhood of Roland Park, the first planned suburban community in America, is one of these richer neighborhoods. The borders of the district are made by The Alameda (Baltimore) on the east and Pimlico Road on the west. The '''Southern district''' is the part of the city below the Inner Harbor and east of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad tracks. It is a mix of industrial and residential areas. It is also a mix of many demographics, cultures, and ethnicities. It is home to the ethnically diverse neighborhood of Locust Point, Baltimore, the historic neighborhood Federal Hill, Baltimore, and poor residential neighborhoods like Cherry Hill, Baltimore. There are two Port of Baltimore terminals in this district. The old Domino Foods plant is also here. The '''Northeastern district''' is mostly residential. It is home to Morgan State University. Today it is mostly African-American. The district is bordered by the city line to the north and east; Sinclair Lane, Erdman Avenue, and US-40 MD on the south; and The Alameda on the west. The '''Eastern district''' is mostly poor, African-American residential neighborhoods. There are entire blocks of abandoned buildings. The district is also dangerous and has a problem with drug trafficking. For this reason, the TV show ''The Wire'' was often filmed in this district. This area is also home to Johns Hopkins Hospital and Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. The district is bordered by Erdman Avenue, Sinclair Lane, and Orleans Street (Baltimore). The '''Southeastern district''' is a mix of industrial and residential areas. Neighborhoods in this district usually have a mix of race (sociology)s and cultures. The district is bordered by Orleans Street, the Inner Harbor, the city line, and the Baltimore harbor. The '''Northwestern district''' is mostly residential. It is also home to the Pimlico Race Course and Sinai Hospital. Until the 1960s, Baltimore's Jewish community was based in the Park Heights, Baltimore neighborhood. Since then, there has been "white flight" and the neighborhood today is almost all black. Northern Parkway (Baltimore) is a dividing line in the district. North of the parkway, the neighborhoods are mostly white. Some of these are Mount Washington, Baltimore and Cheswolde, Baltimore. South of the parkway, the neighborhoods are mostly black. The borders of the district are made up by the county line on the north and west, Gwynns Falls Parkway on the south and Pimlico Road on the east. The '''Western district''' is the home of Coppin State University, Mondawmin Mall, and Edmondson Village, Baltimore. These are important to the culture, economy and history of the city's African American community. This district used to be the home to many middle and upper class African Americans, but they have moved away since. Today, more than 45% of people living in some neighborhoods have income levels below the poverty line. Some of the crime from this district was used in the TV show ''The Wire''. The district is west of downtown. Its borders are Gwynns Falls Parkway, Fremont Avenue, and Baltimore Street. The '''Southwestern district''' is a mix of industrial parks and residential areas. St. Agnes Hospital (Baltimore) is in this district. It has Baltimore County to the west, Baltimore Street to the north, and the downtown area to the east.

All of these are unincorporated census-designated places. *Arbutus, Maryland *Baltimore Highlands, Maryland *Brooklyn Park, Maryland *Catonsville, Maryland *Dundalk, Maryland *Glen Burnie, Maryland *Lansdowne, Maryland *Lochearn, Maryland *Overlea, Maryland *Parkville, Maryland *Pikesville, Maryland *Rosedale, Maryland *Towson, Maryland *Woodlawn, Baltimore County, Maryland ==Culture== File:BromoSeltzertowerBaltimore.jpg, built in 1911.]] Baltimore is sometimes called the "city of neighborhoods." This name comes from the fact that it has 72 official historic districts (areas). People of one ethnic group mainly live in each one of these areas. Some of the most important today are downtown. These are the Inner Harbor, Fells Point, Baltimore, and Little Italy, Baltimore. The Inner Harbor has lots of hotels, shops, and museums. Many tourists visit the Inner Harbor. Fells Point used to be a place where sailors went for entertainment. Today it has been rebuilt and cleaned up. This is the neighborhood in the movie ''Sleepless in Seattle''. Little Italy is where the Italian-American people live and work. Nancy Pelosi grew up in this neighborhood. She used to be Speaker of the House in Congress. Another important neighborhood is Mount Vernon, Baltimore. This neighborhood is the center of culture and art in Baltimore. There are many important monuments and museums there. One important monument is the Washington Monument (Baltimore). This monument was built in the 1800s in a plaza. It is older than the Washington Monument in Washington, D.C.. Every year there is an art festival called Artscape (festival). The festival is in the Bolton Hill, Baltimore neighborhood. This is very close to the Maryland Institute College of Art. Artscape is called the "largest free arts festival in America." Another art festival that happens in Baltmore is the Maryland Film Festival. It happens every year in May. At the Film Festival, movies are shown at the Charles Theatre. (The Charles Theatre is an old cinema.) One of Baltimore's nicknames is "Charm City." Some advertising wanted to make the city's reputation better. They started using the name in 1975. === Language === People in Baltimore speak English. They have a very unique accent and way of speaking (dialect). For example, they pronounce "Baltimore" as "Balamer" or "Balmer." The Baltimore dialect is sometimes called "Baltimorese." It is a kind of Mid-Atlantic English. People from Baltimore will often call each other "Hon." There are movies that parody (make fun of) the way people from Baltimore talk. A lot of these movies are made by John Waters (filmmaker). He is a movie maker from Baltimore. Most of Waters's movies were made in Baltimore. ''Pink Flamingos'' and ''Hairspray (1988 movie)'' are some of these movies. Waters also wrote the musical version of ''Hairspray (musical).'' ===Important people=== Many very famous and important people were born or raised in Baltimore.

There was a lot of steel processing, shipping, car manufacturing, and transportation. Deindustrialization happened, and Baltimore lost a lot of jobs that paid a lot of money and did not need a lot of training or skill. Today, most of the jobs in Baltimore are service economy jobs. These jobs do not pay very much. 90% of jobs are service jobs today. In July 2012, the unemployment rate was 11%. Also in 2012, the steel mill (factory) at Sparrow's Point closed. This will mean more people will lose their jobs. 25% of people who live in Baltimore, and 37% of all children living in Baltimore, live in poverty. Johns Hopkins Hospital is in Baltimore. Some big companies from Baltimore are Under Armour, Cordish Company, and Royal Farms. There is a big sugar refinery in Baltimore. It is owned by American Sugar Refining. ==Transportation== File:BaltimoreLightRail.JPG provides service to Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport and the Baltimore area.]] There are eight Interstate Highway Systems in Baltimore. These are: * Interstate 70 in Maryland * Interstate 83 (the Jones Falls Expressway) * Interstate 95 in Baltimore, Maryland (the John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway (Maryland) * Interstate 395 (Maryland) * Interstate 695 (Maryland) (the Baltimore Beltway) * Interstate 795 (Maryland) (the Northwest Expressway) * Interstate 895 (Maryland) (the Harbor Tunnel Thruway) * Interstate 97 Some of these highways do not connect to each other. I-70 stops at a parking lot just inside of the city. This is because of "freeway and expressway revolts" that happened in Baltimore. The interstate highways were supposed to go through downtown Baltimore, but the people in the city did not want this to happen. Barbara Mikulski, now a United States Senator, started the "freeway revolts" to keep the highways from being built in downtown. Today there are some highways United States Numbered Highways and state routes that run through downtown. These are U.S. Route 1 in Maryland, U.S. Route 40 in Maryland National Road, and the Baltimore–Washington Parkway. There are also some tunnels underneath the Inner Harbor. Interstate 95 in Baltimore, Maryland runs through the Fort McHenry Tunnel. Interstate 895 (Maryland) runs through the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel. Baltimore has a beltway. A beltway is a highway that circles around a city. The Baltimore Beltway is Interstate 695 (Maryland). It crosses over the Chesapeake Bay on the Francis Scott Key Bridge (Baltimore). This bridge is just south of the Inner Harbor. Baltimore is an important train stop. Amtrak trains in the Northeast Corridor stop in Baltimore. Pennsylvania Station (Baltimore) is one of the busiest train stations in the country. In 2008 it was the 8th busiest train station in the United States. That year, more than 1 million people took a train to or from Penn Station. Another important train station is at Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport. Many Amtrak trains stop at the BWI Rail Station. The Amtrak trains that stop in Baltimore are: ''Acela Express'', ''Palmetto (Amtrak)'', ''Carolinian (train)'', ''Silver Star (Amtrak train)'', ''Silver Meteor'', ''Vermonter'', ''Crescent (Amtrak)'', and ''Northeast Regional (Amtrak)''. The MARC Train also has trains that stop in Baltimore.
