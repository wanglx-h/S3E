This page: Clitoris]] File:Clitoris glans - detailed.jpg (the clitoral body is beneath the hood).]] The '''clitoris''' is a female genital. It includes corpora cavernosa, glands, muscles and ligaments, nerves, and blood vessels. In an embryo there is a small raised point that grows into a clitoris in girls or a Human penis in boys. Inside the penis, there is the urethra, but there is no urethra in the clitoris. In women, the urethra is hidden behind the clitoris and in front of the vagina. Penises with male urethras are used daily for urination, and can be used for Sexual intercourse: semen passes out of the body through the male urethra. Although the parts are placed differently, the clitoris is a match to the male penis. The clitoris causes females Sexual intercourse pleasure, arousal and orgasm. fingering (sexual act) or applying other consistent pressure to it is usually needed to help the female have an orgasm. During sexual arousal, erectile Tissue (biological) fills with blood. This causes the clitoris to grow. It grows until orgasm happens. Also during arousal, touching the clitoris and other sensitive areas of the female genitals makes a woman's vagina change shape and release a lubricant. The lubricant and change of shape makes it easier for a man's penis to enter a woman and for sex to occur. Most of the clitorial body is hidden inside the hood, but only a small part of it may be seen outside the body. Adding the outside and inside parts, the clitoris is about the same size as the penis. The clitoris and penis grow from the same tissue in the womb; they bear many similar parts. == Parts of the clitoris== ===Outside the body=== File:Human genitalia - development 1.png File:Comparision of female clitoromegaly and male penis.jpg (right). Female and male genitals are developed from the same bundle of tissue.]] File:Clitoral body, internal anatomy.png The parts of the clitoris that can be seen from the outside are located from the ''clitoral junction'' (the point where the outer lips meet at the base of the pubic mound) to the ''fork'' (where the lower edges of the inner lips meet below the vaginal opening). The outside parts include: * the ''glans'': the head or tip. It is filled with nerve endings. The glans creates pleasurable feelings. It also increases a woman's sexual response. * the hood: the fold of skin formed by the outer edges of the inner lips. It covers the glans. The hood is the same as the male foreskin. * the inner lips: hairless and very sensitivity to touch. === Inside the body === File:Clitoris Anatomy.svg The parts of the clitoris inside the body include erectile tissue, glands, muscles, blood vessels, and nerves. In both the clitoris and the penis, there are two types of erectile tissue. These are ''Corpus cavernosum clitoridis'' (cavern-like body) and Bulb of vestibule. These tissues fill with blood during sexual arousal. This causes an erection. The clitoral shaft is connected to the glans. It is just underneath the surface of the skin. The shaft is a round sponge erectile tissue. It is very sensitive like the glans. It feels like a hard ridge. The shaft is about long. It moves toward the pubic mound for a short distance, then bends sharply and divides. This forms two thin legs. These legs are also made of spongy tissue. The legs spread out like the wishbone of a chicken. == Related pages == * Clitoris (female reproductive system/anatomy) related: clitoral glans, corpus cavernosum clitoridis (female corpus cavernosum) * G-spot * Urethra#female_ug, anus * Penis == References == Category:Anatomy of the female reproductive system Category:Sexuality Category:Masturbation Category:Orgasm
