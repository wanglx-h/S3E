Erik was the son of King Knut Eriksson of Sweden, but his mother is now unknown. In 1205 he escaped from the Battle of Älgarås, where his three brothers were killed. He stayed for three years with family in Norway. He returned to Sweden in 1208 and defeated Sverker II of Sweden in the battle of Lena. He was married in 1210 to Rikissa of Denmark, the daughter of Valdemar I of Denmark and Sophia of Novgorod.Brenner, S Otto: "nachkommen Gorm des Alten", page 24, Dansk Historisk Haandbogsforlag, 1978 Eric was elected king, but the coronation took place only in November 1210, after the Battle of Gestilren where he again defeated and killed Sverker II. Sverker had attempted to regain the throne. King Erik's coronation is the earliest known coronation in Sweden. It was carried out by the bishop Valerius, a former supporter of King Sverker II. In 1216, Pope Innocent III agreed that King Erik was King of Sweden, and also any other pagan lands he captured, probably Finland. Previously, Innocent III had supported Sverker II. Very little is known about King Erik's reign, but it is said that the crops were good while he was king. Erik had several children: # Sofia (died before 24 April 1241), married to Prince Burwin Henry III of Mecklenburg (d. 1277/1278) # Marianne Eriksdotter, Pomeranian princess,Lars O.

He was born in 1216 after his father's death. The Karl Chronicle says that "Erik Lisp and Lame" also had a sister, Martha Farmer. This would have been Erik Knutsson's daughter. Historian Dick Harrison says that this is only political propaganda for Martha's cousin, Karl Knutsson (Bonde). This untrue connection would have made him a relative of the House of Eric. Erik died of a fever in 1216 at Nas Castle in Visingsö. He is buried in the Varnhems Church. ==References== Category:Kings and Queens of Sweden Category:1180 births Category:1216 deaths
