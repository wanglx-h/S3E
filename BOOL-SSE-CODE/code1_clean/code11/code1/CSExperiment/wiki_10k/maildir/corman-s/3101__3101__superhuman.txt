'''Superhuman''' means something that is beyond what wikt:people are naturally able to do. It is a word most used in fiction such as superhero comic books, but also sometimes in science fiction and fantasy movies and books. Any Fictional character in books or movies that is much stronger than any real person, or can do things such as Flight like Superman, is said to be superhuman or to have superhuman powers. The word "superhuman" may also mean something that is not human but can do something that humans cannot, like a robot that can think faster than a person can. Some examples of these are having incredible memory, not needing sleep, being able to run for hours or being able to smell colours. Category:Fiction
