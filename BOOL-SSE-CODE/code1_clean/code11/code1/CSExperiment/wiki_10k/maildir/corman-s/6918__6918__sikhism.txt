It is one of the newest Religion, ranking as the fifth-largest worldwide, with about 25–30 million followers known as the ''Sikhs''.McLeod, William Hewat. 2019 [1998]. ==Overview== The teachings of Guru Nanak Dev, the founder of Sikhism, and the nine Guru who followed him formed the foundation of Sikhism. The tenth guru, Guru Gobind Singh, declared the Sikh scripture Guru Granth Sahib as the eternal guide for Sikhs, concluding the line of human gurus. Guru Nanak Dev emphasized living a practical life with values like purity, truthfulness, self-control and fidelity, prioritizing these over abstract truths. Guru Hargobind, the sixth guru, introduced the idea of balancing the worldly and Spirituality aspects of life. ===Scripture=== The Sikh scripture begins with the Mul Mantar, a fundamental prayer about Ek Onkar ('One God'). Sikhism's key beliefs, found in the Guru Granth Sahib, include faith and meditation in the name of the one creator, recognizing the unity and Egalitarianism of all humans, Altruism, seeking justice for everyone's well-being, and maintaining Trustworthiness while leading a family life. Sikhism rejects the idea that any specific religion holds a monopoly on absolute truth. It encourages practices like meditation (simran) and remembering the teachings through music (kirtan) or internal reflection (naam japna) to feel God's presence. Sikhs are taught to overcome the "Five Thieves" – lust, rage, greed, attachment, and ego. ==Beliefs== File:Pilgrims inside the Golden Temple (9693303510).jpg Guru Granth Sahib is not just a holy book for Sikhs, it is respected and treated as a living being as it is officially The Eternal Guru (Teachers). Shri Guru Granth Sahib is not written by one human but by saints from all across societies and religions. It is a universal teacher for all religions giving the message of one God and respect to all humans of every religion. ===General=== * There is nothing that is beyond or outside the one God. So, therefore there is nothing being created or destroyed, as the creation and destruction are still only part of the one. * The goal of life is to focus on being at one with God. This is attainable by meditation, prayer, and being in the company of others who share a similar goal. ===God=== Sikhism teaches that God lasts forever and cannot be seen. Therefore, God has no gender. It is taught that God created the universe and keeps it running. God is considered to be infinite, Alpha and Omega, no beginning and no end. Sikhs worship God, and meditate on God’s name through intense (passionate) repetition. They believe everything is a part of God and God is a part of everything. Good, bad, neutral are not applicable to God and are meant only for human beings, as Sikh philosophy indicates that human beings are born innately good. Since God created the world he could destroy it whenever he wants. ===Salvation=== Followers are all trying to reach salvation, meaning they are trying to break the process of rebirth and become one with God. The thing that is keeping people from reaching union is bad karma. Bad karma is taught to be caused by pride, anger, greed, attachment and lust. Sikhs try to stay away from these things. Sikhs also believe that a piece of God resides within everything in the world. Once an individual discovers the God within and stops searching else then can he reach salvation. ==Temples== A Sikh temple is called a ''Gurdwara'' (meaning "the house of Guru"). It is the place of worship in the Sikh religion. Birth, death, baptism and marriage Ceremony are held in the temple. There are four doors for all religions. When a person enters the temple, their head must be covered. There are no chairs in the temple so people sit on the floor. The temple also serves as a kitchen. The kitchen is where festive food is donated, prepared and Cooking by Volunteer. All the food that has been made there is shared with all the community who visit the temple on that day. The meal is Vegetarianism and is called the Langar (Sikhism). File:Sikh.man.at.the.Golden.Temple.jpg]] ===Holy sites=== Three holiest sites in Sikhism are the Nankana Sahib, Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur in Pakistan and the Harmandir Sahib in India. In a Gurdwara, no special place or seat may be reserved or set aside for any dignitary, as all are considered equals. The service consists of singing of the liturgy, as well as the exposition of Sikh history, tradition, and theology. In traditional Indian society, people of high and low caste were rigidly segregated. To combat this social problem, the Sikh community kitchen, or ''langar'', requires everyone to sit side by side and eat together, thereby teaching the concept of equality by shattering all barriers of caste and class. Every major city in the United States and Canada has Sikh gurdwaras and they are open to all Sikh people go to Gurdwara to worship God. ==Vaisakhi== Vaisakhi is an important festival celebrated by Sikhs. Vaisakhi is also known as Basaki. It is the harvest festival in the Punjab region. Vaisakhi is celebrated on the first day of the Basak month, in the Nanakshahi calendar. ==Gurus== File:BhaiSahibJiArdas.jpg The term ‘guru’ comes from the Sanskrit ''gurū'', which means teacher, guide, or mentor. The traditions and philosophy of Sikhism were made by ten gurus from 1469 to 1708. Each guru added to and reinforced the message taught by the previous one. This resulted in the creation of the Sikh religion. Meanwhile, the eternal Guru is the Sri Guru Granth Sahib, which is a not just a book but contains the writings of each Guru. In addition to the above, Sikhs also believe in fifteen ''bhagats'' or saints, including ones from other creeds, whose words and deeds have been adopted into Sikhism by the great ten Gurus. Most notable of these ''bhagats'' is the Punjabi people Sufi saint, Hazrat Baba Farid. '''Food Banks''' Sikhs believe in equality therefore they have food banks to go and get food for free. These are known as the ‘Langars’. '''Extra facts''' It is said that Sikhs have to give 10% of their earnings to charity. Sikhs believe in equality therefore the are all equal in money. Nobody is poor and nobody is rich. There is a Sikh alphabet. Sikhism, religion and philosophy founded in the Punjab region of the Indian subcontinent in the late 15th century. The Sikhs call their faith Gurmat (Punjabi: “the Way of the Guru”). According to Sikh tradition, Sikhism was established by Guru Nanak (1469–1539) and subsequently led by a succession of nine other Gurus. {| class="wikitable" !Time in chronological order !Name !Date of birth !Guruship on !Date of death !Age at death !Father !Mother |- |'''1''' |Guru Nanak Dev Ji | 1469 |– |22 September 1539 |70 |Mehta Kalu |Mata Tripta |- |'''2''' |Guru Angad Dev Ji |31 March 1504 |7 September 1539 |29 March 1552 |48 |Baba Pheru |Mata Ramo |- |'''3''' |Guru Amar Das Ji |5 May 1479 |26 March 1552 |1 September 1574 |95 |Tej Bhan Bhalla |Mata Bakht |- |'''4''' |Guru Ram Das Ji |24 September 1534 |1 September 1574 |1 September 1581 |46 |Baba Hari Das |Mata Daya Vati |- |'''5''' |Guru Arjan Dev Ji |15 April 1563 |1 September 1581 |30 May 1606 |43 |Rām Dās |Mata Bhani |- |'''6''' |Guru Har Gobind Sahib Ji |19 June 1595 |25 May 1606 |28 February 1644 |48 |Arjun Dēv |Mata Ganga |- |'''7''' |Guru Har Rai Ji |16 January 1630 |3 March 1644 |6 October 1661 |31 |Baba Gurditta |Mata Nihal |- |'''8''' |Guru Har Krishan Ji |7 July 1656 |6 October 1661 |30 March 1664 |7 |Hari Rā'i |Mata Krishan |- |'''9''' |Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji |1 April 1621 |20 March 1665 |11 November 1675 |54 |Hari Gōbind |Mata Nanki |- |'''10''' |Guru Gobind Singh Ji |22 December 1666 |11 November 1675 |7 October 1708 |41 |Tēġ Bahādur |Mata Gujri |- |'''11''' |Guru Granth Sahib Ji |n/a |7 October 1708 |n/a |n/a | – | – |} === 5 Ks === Khalsa is the military community of Sikhism.
