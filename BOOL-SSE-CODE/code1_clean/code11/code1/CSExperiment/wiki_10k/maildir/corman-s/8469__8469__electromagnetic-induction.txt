'''Electromagnetic induction''' is where a voltage or Electric current is produced in a Electrical conductor by a changing magnetic flux. It may happen when a magnet is moved in a solenoid, or when a solenoid is constantly moved in a stationary magnetic field, thus changing the magnetic flux. == Magnetic flux == When a coiled wire is introduced near a magnet, the magnetic lines of force pass through the coil. This causes the magnetic flux to change. Magnetic flux is represented by the symbol {\Phi}, therefore we can say that {\Phi} = BAcos(a) and the resulting unit will be Tm^2, where T is the unit for magnetic field and m^2 is the unit for area. The changing magnetic flux generates an electromotive force (EMF). This force moves free electrons in a certain way, which constitute a Electric current. == Faraday's law == Michael Faraday found that an electromotive force is generated when there is a change in magnetic flux in a conductor. His laws state that: \mathcal{E} = {-{d\Phi} \over dt} where, \mathcal{E} is the electromotive force, measured in volts; {d\Phi} is the change in magnetic flux, measured in webers; dt is the change in time, measured in seconds. In the case of a solenoid: \mathcal{E} = {-N{d\Phi} \over dt} where, N is the number of loops in the solenoid. == Lenz's law == The negative sign in both equation above is a result of Lenz's law, named after Heinrich Lenz. His law states that the electromotive force (EMF) produces a Electric current that opposes the motion of the changing magnetic flux. == Related pages == *Electromagnetism *Inductor *Transformer Category:Electromagnetism
