A '''soufflé''' is a light fluffy dessert food. It is a lightly baked cake. It can be served as a savoury main dish, but usually it is sweetened as a dessert. It is made with egg yolks and beaten egg whites. The egg whites are beaten to a soft peak meringue. The dish puffs up in the oven. Category:Egg dishes Category:Desserts
