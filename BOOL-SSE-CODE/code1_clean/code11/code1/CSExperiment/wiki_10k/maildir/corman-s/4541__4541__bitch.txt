Subject: Bitch
A '''bitch''' is a female dog. It is also used as a slang insult used to mean a nasty woman. It is possibly derived from the fact that ''bitch'' is used in other ways, however, such as in the phrase ''son of a bitch'' (also ''son of a gun'') or ''bitchy''. Bitch became a term to degrade and insult women as early in 15th century. It's use then surged specially in music industry in 70's. Women started to embrace the word as a term of empowerment. == References == Category:Pejoratives Category:English profanity Category:Women Category:Dogs
