File:Anger Controlls Him.jpg File:Angry woman.jpg File:Child's Angry Face.jpg '''Anger''' is one of the basic emotions. It is an heritability response, and is common to all mammals and a number of other animals. It happens when we are threatened, offended, wronged, or denied something we really want or need. == Psychology of anger == Anger is a main emotion that many experience. It involves a strong, uncomfortable and emotional response to a wikt:provoke. There is a sharp distinction between anger and aggression (verbal or physical, direct or indirect). Both influence each other. Anger can start aggression or increase its probability or intensity. However, it is not necessary nor sufficient for aggression.Novaco, Raymond W. 2000. Anger. In ''Encyclopedia of Psychology''. Oxford University Press Anger is a bit like a pressure cooker: we can only apply pressure against our anger for a certain amount of time until it explodes. People show anger to others by Nonverbal communication, body language, not sympathy other people's problems, and sometimes acts of aggression or force in public (e.g. punching a wall).Michael Kent, ''Anger'', The Oxford Dictionary of Sports Science & Medicine, Oxford University Press, Animals and humans might try to scare- by making loud sounds, trying to make their bodies look bigger, by showing their teeth, or by staring. When we face a challenge, our response may be anger or fear. It may be difficult to decide whether to face the challenge, or walk away. In animal behaviour terms, we face the choice of a fight or flight response. == Hormones and body changes == Being angry changes the human body by making the heart beat faster, increasing blood pressure (the pressure made by the blood at right angles of the walls of blood vessels) and increasing amounts of the hormones adrenaline and :en:Norepinephrine (chemicals which send messages to parts of the body to make changes). Being angry makes the levels of the hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline in the body go up, although this does not last for very long. Adrenaline quickly makes the body ready to act when there is Emergency by increasing the supply of oxygen and glucose (needed to respiration) to the brain and muscles, while slowing less important process the body is doing, like digestion food.[http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?epinephrine Epinephrine] - Online Medical Dictionary :en:Norepinephrine is released during Stress (medicine). It goes to areas of the brain which control attention (how much you think or concentrate) and reactions. It is very important when the body chooses "fight-or-flight" (attacking or running away). Then it increases heart rate, takes glucose out of storage so it can be used, and increases blood flow to muscles. == Symptoms == Anger may be '''passive anger''' or '''aggressive anger'''.
