File:Canova - Helen of Troy, 1819, Н.ск-825.jpg In Greek mythology, '''Helen,''' also known as '''Helen of Troy''' (Ancient Greek language: Ἑλένη, Helénē), was said to have been the most beautiful woman in the world. The queen of Sparta, Helen was married to Menelaus, but later eloped with Prince Paris (mythology) of Troy (most often depicted as being kidnapped) and taken to Troy, resulting in the Trojan War as the Achaean set out to bring her back to Sparta. She was believed to be the daughter of Zeus and Leda, the wife of King Tyndareos of Sparta, and was the sister of twins Castor and Pollux, and Klytaimnestra. == Other websites == * Category:People in Greek mythology
