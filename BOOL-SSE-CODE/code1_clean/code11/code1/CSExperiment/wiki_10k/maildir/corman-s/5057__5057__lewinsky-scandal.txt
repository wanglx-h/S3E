The '''Clinton-Lewinsky scandal''' was an United States of America political sex scandal in 1998. United States President Bill Clinton was said to have had oral sex with 22 year old Monica Lewinsky. Lewinsky said that she had sex with Bill Clinton nine times from November 1995 to March 1997. According to her published schedule, First Lady of the United States Hillary Clinton was at the White House for some of the time on seven of those days. The scandal happened after Linda Tripp leaked the secret phone calls between Clinton and Lewinsky. Clinton did not admit his affair until the annual White House prayer on September 11, 1998, in the presence of several ministers, priests and his wife, Hillary Clinton, in his "I have sinned" speech. The speech was hand-written by Clinton himself and was delivered on the day of publication of the first report by Independent Counsel Ken Starr, which threatened to impeach President Clinton on the grounds of perjury and his sexual affair with former White House intern, Monica Lewinsky. Clinton was eventually Impeachment of Bill Clinton, but not removed from office. == References == Category:1998 in the United States Category:Bill Clinton Category:Political scandals in the United States
