Subject: Wikipedia:Special pages
{| class="floatright" style="text-align: center; margin-right: auto;" | | |} '''Special pages''' are pages generated by the software on demand for special purposes, usually related to project maintenance. They are found in the Special: Help:Namespaces, a virtual namespace whose pages lack corresponding talk pages. They are not written in :en:Help:Wikitext and cannot be directly edited but elements of their pages can sometimes be edited through corresponding pages in the Wikipedia:MediaWiki namespace. If you make a normal redirect to a special page, the redirect will not be immediately followed (though special pages can be targets of :en:Wikipedia:Soft redirects), and directly creating any pages beginning with the Special: prefix is also not possible. Special pages often take :en:parameter (computer programming)s. Sometimes these can be supplied after a slash (as in Special:Log/block); in other cases an index.php call is used; for example https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&days=3&limit=10. Also, the content of most special pages depends on preferences that have been set by the user, e.g. classic or enhanced Recent Changes, the number of titles in Recent Changes and the watchlist, etc. A directory of special pages ''available for the current user'' can be accessed from Special:SpecialPages, which is found in the sidebar of every page on Wikipedia in the Tools section. == Modifying special pages == Although special pages are not themselves editable, they generally contain standard text which is modifiable (although only by administrators). To find the right portion of text, append mw:Help:Qqx to the special page URL, or append &uselang=qqx instead if the URL already contains a ?. This will reveal message names in parentheses. Then, go to that name in the Wikipedia:MediaWiki namespace. For example, [?uselang=qqx Special:BookSources?uselang=qqx] reveals "(booksources-summary)", so MediaWiki:Booksources-summary is used on that page. To propose a modification, leave a request on the talk page of the relevant MediaWiki page. An administrator will make the change if it seems appropriate. == Available special pages == === By function === ==== General information ==== * Special:AllMessages (System messages): displays all pages in the MediaWiki namespace. See Wikipedia:MediaWiki namespace. * Special:SiteMatrix (Wikimedia wikis): lists all Wikimedia projects (such as different language Wikipedias) and their codes. * Special:SpecialPages: a list of most special pages currently available to all users. * Special:Statistics: total number of pages and users in various categories. * Special:Version: shows the version of the software the site is currently running and lists the extensions, skins, and libraries currently installed. ==== Page listings ==== * Special:AllPages: allows the user to access a portion of an alphabetical list of all Wikipedia pages in a specified namespace. A starting point can be given as a parameter, e.g. Special:AllPages/T (pages in the main namespace, from "T"), Special:AllPages/Template: (pages in the Template: namespace, from the start). For the order in which pages are listed, see :en:Help:Alphabetical order. * Special:Categories: shows an alphabetical list of categories, with numbers of members. * Special:CategoryTree: displays categories in a tree structure. * Special:ListFiles (File list): list of images and other files uploaded; can be sorted by size or date.

More information on transcludable special pages can be found at :en:Help:Transclusion#Special pages. === Links containing URL query strings === Because the ampersand character (&) is disallowed, it is not possible to create an ordinary link containing &action=edit or &redirect=no in the URL query string. == Special pages in other languages == The term in the site language equivalent to the English word "Special" and the special page name in English (e.g. "Special:Statistics") is used in each project, for example: * "" in Spanish * "" in Dutch * "" in French * "" in German These also appear in the :en:Help:URLs. The English word "Special" and the special page name in English (e.g. "Special:Statistics") always works, even on foreign-language sites, but non-English equivalents don't work on English-language projects, nor on other-language project besides the language edition one is on. == See also == * mw:Writing a new special page on the MediaWiki site * mw:Category:Special page extensions: MediaWiki category * m:Help:Special page on Meta == Notes == == References == == External links == * [https://doc.wikimedia.org/mediawiki-core/master/php/html/classSpecialPage.html MediaWiki special page class definitions] Category:Wikipedia features
