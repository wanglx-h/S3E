The power of such totalitarianism comes from mass mobilization via the mechanism as mentioned, while voluntary collaboration at every level of society by those agreeing with the same Task is necessary for maintaining the totalitarian state. ==Overview== Five large fascist countries were Italy under Benito Mussolini, Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler's Nazism, the Empire of Japan under Hideki Tojo, Spain under Francisco Franco, and Portugal under António de Oliveira Salazar. Mussolini invented fascism in Italy in the late 1910s, and developed it fully in the 1930s. He came to power in late 1922 and introduced a complete dictatorship in the mid-1920s, by eliminating all other parties and changing the electoral law to make sure his Fascist party got the most seats.Griffin, Roger. 1995. ''Fascism''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 8, 307. When Hitler came to power in Weimar Republic in the 1930s, he copied Mussolini, who wrote a paper called ''The Doctrine of Fascism'' in English language. He started writing it in 1927, but it was only published in 1932. Most of it was probably written by Giovanni Gentile, an Italian philosopher who joined fascism and became an important influence. * * * * * Biography, Idealism, & Fascism |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Giovanni-Gentile |date=December 13, 2024 |access-date=February 5, 2025}} ==Origins== ===Name=== File:Fasces2.png}} image.]] The name fascism comes from the Italian word for ''bundle''. This word comes from the Latin word which was an axe surrounded by a bundle of sticks. In Ancient Rome, leaders carried the as a symbol of their power. ===Benito Mussolini=== A journalist named Benito Mussolini invented fascism. He started Italy's fascist party in 1919. He became Italy's prime minister in 1922. He was not elected. His supporters walked into Rome in large numbers, and the king of Italy made him prime minister. Although, officially, the fascist party in Italy was ruled by a "grand council" from 1922 until the end of World War II, Benito Mussolini really had almost all the power in the country. According to scholar Ruth Ben-Ghiat, Mussolini believed democracy had failed. He had been a Socialism, but left the movement because he thought it was not strong enough, and it had refused to join the First World War. He believed democracy failed because of social class and was too weak to stand against communism. Under fascism, people would focus on the nation and people would not class consciousness but instead pull together for the national good. However, Mussolini also believed that to make fascism work, he and his followers had to remove anything that could distract people from the nation. He also believed he should get to decide who in Italy counted as part of the Italian nation and he should get to throw out or arrest anyone he did not consider a real Italian. He believed it was right to use violence to remove those distractions and those people. Groups of people with weapons would go out into the streets and beat up or even kill people Mussolini did not like. Mussolini did not Freedom of the press. Mussolini believed that Italy should be made of white people, so he encouraged white women to have more babies and persecuted people who were not white. ==History== ===20th century=== The fascist governments in Italy, Germany, and Japan were removed after they lost World War II, but fascism continued as Junta under António de Oliveira Salazar in Portugal, Francisco Franco in Spain, in some parts of Latin America, Africa, and Asia. Under fascism, the economy and other parts of society are heavily and closely controlled by the government, usually by using a form of authoritarian corporatism, where companies and workers are supposed to work together under national unity. The regime employs violence to Execution or Persecution anyone it does not consider useful. ===21st century=== In the 21st century, fascist political movements exist in many countries. ==Main ideas== ===Academic views=== ====Jason Stanley==== Scholars hold different views on the definition of fascism. Philosopher Jason Stanley of Yale University called fascism That is, fascism focuses on one person as the Tyrant, fascism sees communism as threatening and at least one group of people is responsible for the nation's problems. This group could be people from other countries or groups of people within the country. Under Hitler's fascist Germany, the government blamed "Jewish communists", Homophobia, the Ableism, Antiziganism etc. for Weimar Republic's problems. Hitler's tyranny holocaust. ====Robert Paxton==== Americans historian Robert Paxton summarized fascism's characteristics as follows: * Robert O. Paxton, ''The Anatomy of Fascism'' (New York State: Alfred A. Knopf, 2004), 18. * Robert O. Paxton, ‘The Five Stages of Fascism,’ ''The Journal of Modern History'' 70, no. 1 (March 1998): 1–23. * # Desire to end democracy # Purge and ethnic cleansing # Imperialism # Collaboration with established elites # Compensation (psychology) Culture of unity, energy and purity # Obsession with Victim and community decline # Mass (disambiguation)#People-based party of committed Nationalism Militia # Redemption (theology) violence without legal or moral restraints ====Roger Griffin==== In 1991, British people historian Roger Griffin proposed an alternative definition of fascism that it is a form of revolutionary nationalism hinged on the unity of a group to achieve a national rebirth (or ''palingenesis'', Koine Greek: παλιγγενεσία), often by Racism. In 2003, Laurence W. Britt wrote the ''14 Defining Characteristics of Fascism'':Britt, Laurence W. (Spring 2003) [https://secularhumanism.org/2003/03/fascism-anyone/ "Fascism Anyone?"] ''Free Inquiry'' # Electoral fraud # Serious sexism # Controlled mass media # Power of Corporation protected # Obsession with national security # Rampant Nepotism and corruption # Religion and ruling elites tied together # Obsession with crime and punishment # Power of Labor union suppressed or eliminated # Disdain for the importance of human rights # The supremacy of the military or avid militarism # Powerful and continuous expressions of nationalism # Disdain and suppression of Intellectual and the arts # Identification of enemies or scapegoats to unite the population behind the ruler ==Critique== ===Comparison to other forms of totalitarianism=== One of the reasons fascism spread in the early 20th century was because the Russian Revolution had just happened and people were afraid of communism. Landowners and business owners would support fascists because they were afraid of what would happen if the country became communist instead. In her work, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (1951), Hannah Arendt compared National Socialism, Stalinism and Maoism. She does not talk about these regimes being fascist; according to her, they are totalitarian. In 1967, German philosoper Jürgen Habermas warned about a "left-wing fascism" of a protest movement in Germany of the 1960s, commonly known as Ausserparlametarische ("Extra-parliamentary") Opposition (APO). ==Opposition to fascism== There is more than one reason why people living in democratic states oppose fascism, but the main reason is that in a Fascist government the individual citizen doesn't always have the option to vote, nor do they have the option to be someone or to live a lifestyle which the fascists sees as immoral, useless, and unproductive towards society. For example, if one is not Heterosexuality and cisgender (but is Homosexuality, cross-dressing, transgender, etc.), they can be arrested and put on trial. ==Related pages== * Antisemitism in Europe * Authoritarianism * Extremism * Islam and fascism * Islamophobia * Neo-Nazism * Antiziganism ==References== Category:Fascism Category:Dictatorship Category:World War II Category:20th century in Italy
