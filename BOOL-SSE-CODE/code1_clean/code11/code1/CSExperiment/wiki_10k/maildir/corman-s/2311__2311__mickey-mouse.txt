He is the Walt Disney Studios (division) and The Walt Disney Company's mascot. Mickey is an Anthropomorphism black mouse who wears red shorts, large yellow shoes and white gloves. He is known for his small size and falsetto voice, the latter of which was originally provided by Walt Disney. Mickey is known all around the world as a very famous cartoon character. Mickey first appeared in the 1928 short ''Plane Crazy'', but did not make his official debut until ''Steamboat Willie'', released later that year. He was created as a replacement for Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. Mortimer Mouse was supposed to be Mickey Mouse's original name, but Lillian Disney, Walt's wife, said it should be "Mickey" instead. The character has appeared in over 130 movies, including ''The Band Concert'' (1935) and ''Brave Little Tailor'' (1938). Mickey mainly appeared in short movies, but also sometimes in feature-length movies, such as ''Fantasia (movie)'' (1940). Ten of Mickey's cartoons were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, one of which, ''Lend a Paw'', won the award in 1941. In 1978, Mickey became the first cartoon character to have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Mickey has also appeared in comic strips and comic books. Mickey also appears in television shows such as ''The Mickey Mouse Club'' (1955–1996) and others. He appears in other media such as video games as well as merchandising and is a meetable character at the Disney parks. Mickey often appears alongside his girlfriend Minnie Mouse, his pet dog Pluto (Disney), and his friends Donald Duck, Daisy Duck and Goofy. Due to the Copyright Extension Act, the 1928 Mickey Mouse cartoons enter the public domain in 2024. Following this event, Mickey's further appearances will be in the public domain in the future. ==Filmography== '''Selected short films''' * ''Plane Crazy'' (1928) * ''The Gallopin Gaucho'' (1928) * ''Steamboat Willie'' (1928) * ''The Barn Dance'' (1929) * ''The Opry House'' (1929) * ''When the Cat's Away'' (1929) * ''The Barnyard Battle'' (1929) * ''The Plowboy'' (1929) * ''The Karnival Kid'' (1929) * ''Mickey's Follies'' (1929) * ''Mickey's Choo-Choo'' (1929) * ''The Jazz Fool'' (1929) * ''Jungle Rhythm'' (1929) * ''The Haunted House'' (1929) * ''Wild Waves (movie)'' (1929) * ''Fiddling Around'' (1930) * ''The Barnyard Concert'' (1930) * ''The Cactus Kid'' (1930) * ''The Fire Fighters'' (1930) * ''The Shindig'' (1930) * ''The Chain Gang'' (1930) * ''The Gorilla Mystery'' (1930) * ''The Picnic'' (1930) * ''Pioneer Days'' (1930) * ''The Birthday Party (1931 movie)'' (1931) * ''Traffic Troubles'' (1931) * ''The Castaway'' (1931) * ''The Moose Hunt'' (1931) * ''The Delivery Boy'' (1931) * ''Mickey Steps Out'' (1931) * ''Blue Rhythm'' (1931) * ''Fishin' Around'' (1931) * ''The Barnyard Broadcast'' (1931) * ''The Beach Party'' (1931) * ''Mickey Cuts Up'' (1931) * ''Mickey's Orphans'' (1931) * ''The Duck Hunt'' (1932) * ''The Grocery Boy'' (1932) * ''The Mad Dog'' (1932) * ''Barnyard Olympics'' (1932) * ''Mickey's Revue'' (1932) * ''Musical Farmer'' (1932) * ''Mickey in Arabia'' (1932) * ''Mickey's Nightmare'' (1932) * ''Trader Mickey'' (1932) * ''The Whoopee Party'' (1932) * ''Touchdown Mickey'' (1932) * ''The Wayward Canary'' (1932) * ''Parade of the Award Nominees'' (1932) * ''The Klondike Kid'' (1932) * ''Mickey's Good Deed'' (1932) * ''Building a Building'' (1933) * ''The Mad Doctor (1933 movie)'' (1933) * ''Mickey's Pal Pluto'' (1933) * ''Mickey's Mellerdrammer'' (1933) * ''Ye Olden Days'' (1933) * ''Giantland'' (1933) * ''Shanghaied'' (1934) * ''Camping Out'' (1934) * ''Playful Pluto'' (1934) * ''Gulliver Mickey'' (1934) * ''Mickey's Steam-Roller'' (1934) * ''Orphan's Benefit (1934 movie)'' (1934) * ''Mickey Plays Papa'' (1934) * ''The Dognapper'' (1934) * ''Two-Gun Mickey'' (1934) * ''Mickey's Man Friday'' (1935) * ''The Band Concert'' (1935) * ''Mickey's Service Station'' (1935) * ''Mickey's Kangaroo'' (1935) * ''Mickey's Garden'' (1935) * ''Mickey's Fire Brigade'' (1935) * ''Pluto's Judgement Day'' (1935) * ''On Ice (movie)'' (1935) * ''Mickey's Polo Team'' (1936) * ''Orphans' Picnic'' (1936) * ''Mickey's Grand Opera'' (1936) * ''Thru the Mirror'' (1936) * ''Mickey's Rival'' (1936) * ''Moving Day (movie)'' (1936) * ''Alpine Climbers'' (1936) * ''Mickey's Circus'' (1936) * ''Donald and Pluto'' (1936) * ''Mickey's Elephant'' (1936) * ''The Worm Turns'' (1937) * ''Magician Mickey'' (1937) * ''Moose Hunters'' (1937) * ''Mickey's Amateurs'' (1937) * ''Hawaiian Holiday'' (1937) * ''Clock Cleaners'' (1937) * ''Lonesome Ghosts'' (1937) * ''Boat Builders (movie)'' (1938) * ''Mickey's Trailer'' (1938) * ''The Whalers'' (1938) * ''Mickey's Parrot'' (1938) * ''Brave Little Tailor'' (1938) * ''Society Dog Show'' (1939) * ''Mickey's Surprise Party'' (1939) * ''The Pointer'' (1939) * ''Tugboat Mickey'' (1940) * ''Pluto's Dream House'' (1940) * ''Mr. Mouse Takes a Trip'' (1940) * ''The Little Whirlwind'' (1941) * ''A Gentleman's Gentleman'' (1941) * ''Canine Caddy'' (1941) * ''The Nifty Nineties'' (1941) * ''Orphan's Benefit (1941 movie)'' (1941) * ''Lend a Paw'' (1941) * ''Mickey's Birthday Party'' (1942) * ''Symphony Hour'' (1942) * ''Pluto and the Armadillo'' (1943) * ''Squatter's Rights (movie)'' (1946) * ''Mickey's Delayed Date'' (1947) * ''Mickey Down Under'' (1948) * ''Mickey and the Seal'' (1948) * ''R'coon Dawg'' (1951) * ''Pluto's Party'' (1952) * ''Pluto's Christmas Tree'' (1952) * ''The Simple Things'' (1953) '''Movies''' * ''Fantasia (movie)'' (1940) * ''Fun and Fancy Free'' (1947) * ''Fantasia 2000'' (1999) ==Pets== Mickey Mouse has a pet; a dog named Pluto.
