It borders Latvia to the north, Belarus to the southeast, Poland to the south and Russia to the southwest. It is one of the Baltic states. ==Overview== The country's area is 65,300 km² and there are about 2.8 million people who live in Lithuania. The national language is the Lithuanian language, which is spoken by around 3 million people. Vilnius is the capital (city) and largest city.

The colors of the Flag of Lithuania are yellow (at the top) for the sun, green (in the middle) for the fields, and red (at the bottom) for the blood of Lithuanians fighting for its independence. == History == Lithuania began to turn into a country in the 7th century to the 9th century centuries from Baltic states nations group. The Balts, the ancestors of Lithuanians and the Latvians, came to the area between Neman and the Daugava River and the Baltic Sea from the supposed original homeland of the Proto-Indo-European languages. Many scientists think they came there sometime in the 3rd millennium BC. The traditional date of the beginning of the country is 1236, when the Lithuanians won the Battle of Šiauliai (Battle of Sun). The Grand Duchy of Lithuania signed a treaty with Poland in 1569 which made it the same country. The country was taken over by the Russian Empire in 1795, which ended the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. It got back its independence on February 16, 1918. In 1940, the country was annexed by the Soviet Union. On June 22, 1941, during the Operation Barbarossa, Grand Duchy of Lithuania was occupied until 1944. Lithuania declared its independence again on March 11, 1990. The country is now an independent semi-presidential democratic republic. == Politics == File:Lithuanian President Valdas Adamkus and Vice President Dick Cheney in Vilnius, Lithuania.jpg Lithuania has been a member of NATO and the European Unionsince 2004.
