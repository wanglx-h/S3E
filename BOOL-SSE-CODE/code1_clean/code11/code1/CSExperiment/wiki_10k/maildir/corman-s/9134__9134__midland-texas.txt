It is called Midland, because it is the midway point between two bigger cities in Texas, Fort Worth, Texas and El Paso, Texas. Oil was discovered in the region in 1923 and is still a larger part of the economy. Midland is also famous as the hometown of former First Lady of the United States Barbara Bush. She and her husband, former president George H. W. Bush lived there, with their children including the later President (United States) George W. Bush and his wife Laura Welch Bush, and his brother Jeb Bush, the former Governor of Florida. == References == Category:Cities in Texas Category:County seats in Texas
