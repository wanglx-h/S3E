| website = }} The '''Academy Awards''', commonly known as the '''Oscars''', are the best-known movie awards in the United States. The awards have been given by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences since 1929. The awards ceremony takes place each year in late February or early March in Los Angeles, California. ==History== At the end of the 1920s, the American film industry was in a crisis. When the radio was invented, people didn't go to the cinema as often as they used to. The owners of the studios had problems. They had to pay the workers a good salary, but that was impossible at that time. Many people fought for a good salary and a good working time. The director of the successful Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Louis B. Mayer, met two good friends because he wanted to speak about the problem. ==Oscar statue== ===Naming=== In the first years of the award, the trophy was called the Academy Award of Merit. The origin of the name Oscar is not clear. It is certain that the name was used in 1931. There may be up to four people that the "Oscar" is named after. The former board secretary of the Academy Margaret Herrick said: "He looks like my uncle Oscar!" Bette Davis said that the statue looked like her first husband Harmon "Oscar" Nelson. The film columnist Sidney Skolsky said that he was the name-giver, and the fourth person was Walt Disney. It is said that Oscar is not the official name of the statue, but the nickname is trademark-protected. ===Trophy=== The statue is around 13 inches tall and weighs about 8 pounds. == Categories == '''Current Awards''' * Academy Award for Best Picture– since 1928 * Academy Award for Best Actor– since 1928 * Academy Award for Best Actress–since 1928 * Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor– since 1936 * Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress– since 1936 * Academy Award for Best Animated Feature– since 2001 * Academy Award for Best Art Direction– since 1928(also called Interior or Set Decoration) * Academy Award for Best Cinematography– since 1928 * Academy Award for Costume Design– since 1948 * Academy Award for Directing since 1928 * Academy Award for Documentary Feature since 1943 * Academy Award for Documentary Short Subject since 1941 * Academy Award for Film Editing– since 1935 * Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film– since 1947 * Academy Award for Makeup– since 1981 * Academy Award for Original Music Score- since 1934 * Academy Award for Best Song- since 1934 * Academy Award for Animated Short Film– since 1931 * Academy Award for Live Action Short Film since 1931 * Academy Award for Sound Mixing since 1930 * Academy Award for Sound Effects Editing– since 1963 * Academy Award for Visual Effects– since 1939 * Academy Award for Adapted Screenplay– since 1928 * Academy Award for Original Screenplay– since 1940 * Academy Award, Scientific or Technical– since 1931, presented at three levels '''Retired Awards''' * Academy Award for Best Assistant Director– 1933 to 1937 * Academy Award for Best Dance Direction– 1935 to 1937 * Academy Award for Comedy Direction– 1928 only * Academy Award for Engineering Effects– 1928 only * Academy Award for Best Original Music or Comedy Score- 1995-1999 * Academy Award for Best Original Story– 1928 to 1956 * Academy Award for Best Score- Adaptation or Treatment– 1962 to 1962 and 1973 * Academy Award for Best Short Film - Color– 1936 and 1937 * Academy Award for Best Short Film - Live Action - 2 Reels– 1936 to 1956 * Academy Award for Short Film - Novelty– 1932 to 1935 * Academy Award for Best Title Writing– 1928 only * Academy Award for Unique and Artistic Production– 1928 only ==Records== ===The most successful films=== ''Gone with the Wind (movie)'' from 1939 was the most successful film for a long time with ten Oscars.
