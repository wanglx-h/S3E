It is officially the '''Kingdom of eSwatini''' (''Umbuso weSwatini''). It was called '''Swaziland''' until April 2018. ==Overview== The capital (city) of Eswatini is Mbabane. The country is named after the 19th-century king Mswati II. ESwatini was colonized by the British Empire and the Boer at the end of the 19th century. Eswatini is a small country. It is no more than north to south and east to west. It is completely surrounded by land. ESwatini does not touch the sea. The two countries that touch it are Mozambique and South Africa. The country's two largest cities are the Public administration capital Mbabane and the economic center Manzini. The seat of government is Lobamba. On 19 April 2018, the King of eSwatini Mswati III announced that the Kingdom of Swaziland had renamed itself the Kingdom of eSwatini. Part of the reason was that the old name sounded too similar to Switzerland. == Health == ESwatini is strongly affected by HIV and AIDS. The 2012 CIA World Factbook showed Swaziland with the highest HIV infection rate in the world. Life expectancy is 50 years. == Education == Education in eSwatini is free at primary level, mainly 1st and 2nd grades. It is also free for orphaned and vulnerable children. Children are not required to attend. In 1996, the primary school enrollment rate was 90.8%. Girls and boys both attended at the primary level. In 1998, 80.5% of children reached grade five. The University of eSwatini provides higher education. == Demographics == Image:Ssa clem 48.jpg Most of eSwatini’s people are ethnically Swazi people. There is also a small number of Zulus and white Africans, mostly people of British people and Afrikaner descent. eSwatini also has some Portuguese people settlers and African refugees from Mozambique. 82.70% of the people are Christianity. Christianity in eSwatini is sometimes mixed with traditional beliefs and practices. Some people think of the king as having a spiritual role. ESwatini also has a small Islam.
