Image:TinyTim.jpg, late 1980s]] '''Herbert Buckingham Khaury''', better known as '''Tiny Tim''' (April 12, 1932 – November 30, 1996), was an United States singer and musician. He became :wikt:popular in the late 1960s due to his appearances on television, and songs played on ukulele with a falsetto voice. His most famous song was "Tiptoe Through the Tulips". His best-remembered television appearances were on ''Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In'' and ''The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson''. His first wedding took place on ''The Tonight Show'' in 1969, at television host Johnny Carson's suggestion. ==Career== Tim was not just a performer, he was also an expert musicology, who studied American music from the earliest days of the United States, and performed many historic songs in his act. Over time, he used his falsetto voice less, and performed most songs in his natural, baritone voice. When his popularity as a pop music lessened, he performed in small nightclubs and other places, as he had earlier. During the 1980s, he toured with a circus, and appeared in a movie as a circus performer who turned to crime. In the 1990s, he recorded new music (including a Christmas album (music)), and joined comedian Pat Paulsen in his latest mock campaign to become President of the United States, as Paulsen's running mate. ==Personal life== Married three times, his last wife was a former fan, who met him when she made a documentary about his life and career. One of his later supporters was radio talk show host Howard Stern. Tiny Tim died in 1996, after suffering a heart attack during a performance.
