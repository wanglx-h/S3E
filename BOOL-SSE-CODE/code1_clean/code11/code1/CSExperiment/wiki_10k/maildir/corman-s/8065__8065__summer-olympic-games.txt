File:Olympic rings.svg The '''Summer Olympic Games''' or the '''Games of the Olympiad''' are an international sporting event which are held every four years by the International Olympic Committee. The "Games", as they are often called, are held in a different city each time. It is a great honour for a city to be "awarded" (given) the right to hold the Olympic Games. Two years after the Summer Olympics, the Winter Olympic Games are held. The Winter Games were held in the same year as the summer Games from 1924 to 1992 and then switched to two years apart in 1994. These are always in a cold, mountainous place because the sports are all snow and ice sports such as skiing. Many more countries send athletes to the Summer Olympics than to the Winter Olympics The Olympic Games were first held in Ancient Greece more than two thousand years ago. The first modern Summer Olympic Games were held in Athens in 1896. There were 200 Sportsperson from Greece and 45 athletes from 13 other countries. Since 1904, medals have been given to the three best athletes or teams in each sport. The earliest Games consisted of 42 events only, but it was expected that 10,500 athletes would wikt:compete in the 302 events on the program for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. == List of modern Summer Olympic Games == File:Summer olympics all cities.PNG Games in ''italics'' were cancelled or have not yet been held. * 1896 – 1896 Summer Olympics – Athens, Greece, Greece * 1900 – 1900 Summer Olympics – Paris, France * 1904 – 1904 Summer Olympics – St. Louis, Missouri, Missouri, United States * ''1906 – 1906 Summer Olympics – Athens, Greece, Greece * 1908 – 1908 Summer Olympics – London, United Kingdom * 1912 – 1912 Summer Olympics – Stockholm, Sweden * ''1916 – 1916 Summer Olympics – Berlin, Germany - Cancelled due to World War I'' * 1920 – 1920 Summer Olympics – Antwerp, Belgium * 1924 – 1924 Summer Olympics – Paris, France * 1928 – 1928 Summer Olympics – Amsterdam, Netherlands * 1932 – 1932 Summer Olympics – Los Angeles, California, California, United States * 1936 – 1936 Summer Olympics – Berlin, Germany * ''1940 – 1940 Summer Olympics – Helsinki, Finland - Cancelled due to World War II'' * ''1944 – 1944 Summer Olympics – London, United Kingdom - Cancelled due to World War II'' * 1948 – 1948 Summer Olympics – London, United Kingdom * 1952 – 1952 Summer Olympics – Helsinki, Finland * 1956 – 1956 Summer Olympics – Melbourne, Australia / Stockholm, Sweden (Equestrianism events) * 1960 – 1960 Summer Olympics – Rome, Italy * 1964 – 1964 Summer Olympics – Tokyo, Japan * 1968 – 1968 Summer Olympics – Mexico City, Mexico * 1972 – 1972 Summer Olympics – Munich, West Germany (now Munich, Germany) * 1976 – 1976 Summer Olympics – Montreal, Quebec, Canada * 1980 – 1980 Summer Olympics – Moscow, Soviet Union (now Moscow, Russia) * 1984 – 1984 Summer Olympics – Los Angeles, California, California, United States * 1988 – 1988 Summer Olympics – Seoul, South Korea * 1992 – 1992 Summer Olympics – Barcelona, Spain * 1996 – 1996 Summer Olympics – Atlanta, Georgia, Georgia (U.S. state), United States * 2000 – 2000 Summer Olympics – Sydney, Australia * 2004 – 2004 Summer Olympics – Athens, Greece, Greece * 2008 – 2008 Summer Olympics – Beijing, People's Republic of China / Hong Kong (Equestrianism events) * 2012 – 2012 Summer Olympics – London, United Kingdom * 2016 – 2016 Summer Olympics – Rio de Janeiro, Brazil * 2020 – 2020 Summer Olympics – Tokyo, Japan * 2024 – 2024 Summer Olympics – Paris, France * ''2028 – 2028 Summer Olympics – Los Angeles, California, United States'' * ''2032 – 2032 Summer Olympics – Brisbane, Australia'' == Cancelled Games == * The 1906 Summer Olympics or 1906 Intercalated Games were discounted ''ex post facto'' by the International Olympic Committee.
