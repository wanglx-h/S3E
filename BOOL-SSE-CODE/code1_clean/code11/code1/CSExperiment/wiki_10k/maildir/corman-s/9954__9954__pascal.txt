'''Pascal''' is a programming language. It was created in 1970 by Niklaus Wirth, to help people learn how to make computer programs. == Development == Now, there are many different dialects of the language, some of which support object-oriented programming. In 1990 the “Pascal” and “Extended Pascal” standards were registered with the International Organization for Standardization. == Description == Every Variable#Variables in computer science has to be declared before it is used. Pascal is a strongly typed programming language: Every variable has a data type. You are only allowed to assign values to the variable that are valid for the data type. This ensures that the programmer does not make unintentional mistakes. Pascal is a imperative programming. The language distinguishes between procedures and functions. A function returns a value, a procedure does not. As such, a function call appears in an expression, whereas a procedure invocation is a statement. == Code samples == This code prints Hello world program at console window: program helloWorld(output); begin writeLn('Hello world!'); { which is short for: writeLn(output, 'Hello world!); } end. This code calculate factorial of a positive integer, using recursion. program factorialDemo(input, output); function factorial(n: integer): integer; begin if n == Pascal variants == * [https://www.gnu-pascal.de/ GNU Pascal] * [https://www.freepascal.org Free Pascal] * Delphi programming language – Modern IDE for creating GUI programs for Microsoft Windows.
