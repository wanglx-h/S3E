Such swarms are usually made of a great number of locusts. They do a lot of damage to the places where they pass, by eating the crops. These are species which breed rapidly under suitable conditions. The migratory locust is the best-known example. They become gregarious and migratory when their populations become dense enough. They form bands as nymph (biology) and swarms as adults. Both the bands and the swarms are nomadic and rapidly strip fields and greatly pest (organism). The adults are powerful fliers; they can travel great distances, consuming practically all green material wherever the swarm settles.Stephen J. Simpson and Gregory A. Sword 2008. Locusts.
