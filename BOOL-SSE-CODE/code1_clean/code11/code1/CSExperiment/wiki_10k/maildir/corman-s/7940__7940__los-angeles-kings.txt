They were named at least in part for a former minor league hockey team called the Los Angeles Monarchs. They made the finals in 1993, and lost to the Montreal Canadiens. They won their first Stanley Cup in team history on June 11, 2012, defeating the New Jersey Devils 4 games to 2. The team won their second Stanley Cup on June 13, 2014 after they defeated the New York Rangers in double overtime of Game 5. The Kings have been known for their high scoring teams. Marcel Dionne won the Art Ross Trophy as NHL scoring champion in 1980, and Wayne Gretzky won it on the Kings in 1990, 1991, and 1994. Gretzky also won the Hart Trophy as the NHL's most valuable player on the Kings in 1989. Charlie Simmer tied for the most goals (now the Richard Trophy) in 1980. Luc Robitaille, one of the ten highest goal scorers in NHL history, spent most of his years on the Kings. ==Players== Other strong players have included Rob Blake, who won the Norris Trophy as best defenceman in 1998; goaltender Rogie Vachon, who was second in voting for the Hart Trophy in 1975; and Dave Taylor, Bernie Nicholls, and Larry Murphy. == References == ==Other websites== *[http://kings.nhl.com/ Official website] Category:1967 establishments in California Category:Ice hockey teams in the United States Category:Los Angeles Kings
