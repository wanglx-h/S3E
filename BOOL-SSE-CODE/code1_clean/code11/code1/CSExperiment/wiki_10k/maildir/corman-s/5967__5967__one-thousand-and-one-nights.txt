Subject: One Thousand and One Nights
'''''One Thousand and One Nights''''' is an old cycle (or group) of stories that mostly come from Arabia and Persia, and a few also from India, Central Asia and China. All these stories were later collected together. There are different layers of the stories:https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Thousand-and-One-Nights * Uppermost is the story of Queen Scheherazade who needs to entertain her husband, the Sultan or King Sheheryar, or she would be put to death. * The next layer is made up of the actual stories, such as Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves, Aladdin and the Magic Lamp, etc. * In those stories, there is often also a narrator who tells the story. It is similar to ''101 Nights'', also known as ''The Book with the Story of the 101 Nights'', another Arabic story collection. The collections only have two stories in common - “The Ebony Horse” and “The King’s Son and the Seven Viziers,” popularly known as “The Book of Sinbad.”https://egyptindependent.com/arabian-nights-has-smaller-sibling/ ==Related pages== * Sinbad the Sailor * Ali Baba * Aladdin * Hanna Diyab == References == ==Other websites== * [http://www.wollamshram.ca/1001/index.htm ''The Thousand Nights and a Night'' in several classic translations], including unexpurgated version by Sir Francis Burton, and John Payne translation, with additional material. * ''Stories From One Thousand and One Nights'', (Lane and Poole translation): [http://www.bartleby.com/16/ Project Bartleby edition] * ''The Arabian Nights'' (includes Lang and (expurgated) Burton translations): [http://www.arabiannights.org/index2.html Electronic Literature Foundation editions] * [http://www.arabiannights.org/medieval.html The Medieval Arabic Nights] - a study * [http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04/arnsc10.txt Jonathan Scott translation of Arabian Nights] * [http://www.crock11.freeserve.co.uk/arabian.htm Notes on the influences and context of the ''Thousand and One Nights''] * [http://www.uh.edu/~cfreelan/courses/HumanSit/1001Resources.htm 1001 Resources and Links for A Thousand and One Nights] University of Houston * [http://www.crock11.freeserve.co.uk/arabian.htm The Book of the Thousand and One Nights] by John Crocker * [http://xahlee.org/p/arabian_nights/index.html (expurgated) Sir Burton's ~1885 translation, annotated for English study.] * [http://www.arabian-nights.org/ Arabian Nights' Tales] Dedicated site with just the stories of 1001 nights listed in order.
