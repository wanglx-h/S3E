1 1 1 1 2 1 '''1''' '''3''' 3 1 1 '''4''' 6 4 1 1 5 10 10 5 1 The first six rows of Pascal's triangle '''Pascal's Triangle''' is a triangle array. It is named after French people mathematician Blaise Pascal, but it was known in China, Persia, and India long before Pascal was born. Pascal's triangle can be made as follows. On the first wikt:row, write only the number 1. Then, to get the numbers of following rows, add the number that can be seen above and to the left (if any) and the number above and to the right (if any) to find the new value. For example, the numbers 1 and 3 in the fourth row are added to make 4 in the fifth row.

It can also be used in binomial expansions. For example, :(''x'' + 1)2 = 1''x''2 + 2''x'' + 12. Notice the coefficients are the third row of Pascal's triangle: 1,2,1. In general, when a binomial is raised to a positive integer power we have: :(''x'' + ''y'')''n'' = ''a''0''x''''n'' + ''a''1''x''''n''−1''y'' + ''a''2''x''''n''−2''y''2 + … + ''a''''n''−1''xy''''n''−1 + ''a''''n''''y''''n'', where the coefficients ''a''''i'' in this expansion are precisely the numbers on row ''n''+1 of Pascal's triangle; in other words, :a_i = {n \choose i}. == Pascal's rule == wikt:formally speaking, the way of making the Pascal's Triangle uses Pascal's rule, which states that : {n \choose k} = {n-1 \choose k-1} + {n-1 \choose k} for non-negative integers ''n'' and ''k'' where ''n'' ≥ ''k'' and with the initial condition : {n \choose 0} = {n \choose n} = 1. == Complicated structures based on Pascal's triangle == Pascal's triangle wikt:general readily into higher dimensions. The three-dimensional version is called Pascal's pyramid or ''Pascal's tetrahedron''. A higher-dimensional analogue is generically called a "Pascal's simplex"*. See also pyramid, tetrahedron, and simplex. == Properties of Pascal's Triangle == The first and last number in each row is always 1. : {n \choose 0} = {n \choose n}=1 The second number in each row is the row number. In a binomial expansion, this second number is equal to the power. (This makes the 'first' row, 1, actually the zero row). : {n \choose 1} = n The rows always read the same forward and backward. : {n \choose k} = {n \choose n-k} The sum of the numbers in each row is double the sum of the numbers in the row before. The sum of each row is 2''n''. : The zero row, 1, has a sum of 1. : 1=2^0=1 : : The first row, 1,1 has a sum of 2. : 1+1=2^1=2 : : The second row, 1,2,1 has a sum of 4. : 1+2+1=2^2=4 : : The third row, (1,3,3,1) has a sum of 8. : 1+3+3+1=2^3=8 : : The sum of the nth row is 2^n : \sum_{i=0}^n {n \choose i} = 2^n == References == == Other websites == * [http://ntc.egrd.net/ Higher Dimensional Pascal's Triange - Like Structures] Category:Mathematics
