This country is also known as '''Gambia'''.There is variability in the use of the definite article, and whether it is capitalized. The British Permanent Committee on Geographical Names notes, ''We do have a letter dated May 1964 from the Gambian prime minister's office which instructed us that it should be The Gambia with a capital T. One of the reasons they gave was that Gambia could be confused with Zambia, which was a new name to the international community at the time.''[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-18233844] However, in running text the present Gambian government generally does not capitalize the "the", and in captions it drops the "the" altogether.[http://www.statehouse.gm/] It is a country in West Africa. It is surrounded by Senegal. It is the smallest country on mainland Africa. Banjul is the capital city. The largest cities are Serekunda and Brikama. == Geography == The geography of Gambia is unusual. It is a long, thin country.

Then in 2016, Adama Barrow was Gambian presidential election, 2016. ===Administrative divisions=== The Gambia is divided into eight local government areas. They are: * Banjul * Kanifing (Gambia) * Brikama (Gambia) * Mansa Konko * Kerewan (Gambia) * Kuntaur (Gambia) * Janjanbureh (Gambia) * Basse (Gambia) As of 2013, these are then divided into 43 Districts of the Gambia. == Culture == The population of The Gambia is about 1.7 million. People from The Gambia are called '''Gambians'''. A number of people from different cultures and backgrounds live in The Gambia.

Most Gambians follow the religion of Islam.
