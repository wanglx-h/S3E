Subject: International Nuclear Event Scale
The '''International Nuclear Event Scale''' (INES) is a system introduced by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). It was introduced to allow wikt:people to communicate how serious a nuclear accident is. Other people are then able to react faster to take protection measures. For each level, there is a list of things that must be there, for the accident to be of that level. There are 7 levels on the INES scale: '''7'''Major accident(maximum credible accident) '''6'''Serious accident '''5'''Accident with off-site risk '''4'''Accident without off-site risk '''3'''Serious incident '''2'''Incident '''1'''Anomaly '''0'''Deviation, no safety relevance ==Details== File:INES en.svg'''Level 7''' is the highest level. Accidents of this type have a large impact (pollution, radiation) outside the site where they occur. The health of many people is put in danger. There are big effects on the environment. Examples: Fukushima nuclear disaster - 2011, Chernobyl disaster (former Soviet Union) - 1986. '''Level 6''' Accidents of this type have a large impact (pollution, radiation) outside the site where they occur. Several governments may need to do a lot to protect their population. Example: Mayak (former Soviet Union) 1957. Because of the levels of Radioactive materialss released, the Mayak accident would probably be rated at level 7 today. '''Level 5''' Accidents of this type release some radiation. Some groups of people which are at risk may need special countermeasures. Examples: Windscale fire (United Kingdom) - 1957, Three Mile Island accident (United States) - 1979. ''The Levels 5-7 are related to severe damage of the reactor core and the radiological barriers.'' '''Level 4''' is for significant damage of the reactor core / radiological barriers and/or a fatal exposure of a worker (or more), but the off-site impact is minor, resulting in public exposure of the order of the prescribed limits. Examples: Windscale (United Kingdom) - 1973, Saint-Laurent (France) - 1980, Buenos Aires (Argentina) - 1983. '''Level 3''' is for very small off-site impact, although related to severe spread of contamination on-site / acute health effects to a worker (or more). It is a "near accident" event, when no safety layers are remaining. Example: Vandellos (Spain) - 1989, Thorp nuclear fuel reprocessing plant Sellafield (United Kingdom) - 2005. '''Level 2''' is an incident with no off-site impact, related to significant spread of contamination on-site / overexposure of a worker. '''Level 1''' is an anomaly beyond the authorized operating regime. '''Level 0''' is a "below-scale event" of no safety significance. There are also events of no safety relevance, characterized as "out of scale". == Other websites == *[http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Factsheets/English/ines-e.pdf International Nuclear Event Scale] , IAEA *[http://www-news.iaea.org/news/inesmanual/INES-2001-E.pdf International Nuclear Event Scale, User's Manual] , IAEA, 2001 Category:Nuclear accidents
