It is surrounded by (clockwise) Middle East, Central Asia, Eastern Asia, Southeastern Asia and the Indian Ocean. The Indian subcontinent makes up a large part of South Asia and is primarily a geographical term while South Asia is more of a geopolitical term used to refer to a certain group of nations as a whole. They are as follows: * Afghanistan * * * * * * * * * The natural resource most used by the people is the rich land. Most of the people living there are farmers. They produce a lot of cashews, rice, peanuts, sesame seeds, and tea. A lot of natural gas is there, but these resources are usually underdeveloped. Many people there raise cattle and sheep. The cattle are raised for their milk or to carry things in Hindu areas. In India, the cattle are very important to the environment because the manure is a fertilizer for farmers. The climate of South Asia can be divided into three basic types: tropical, dry, and wikt:temperate. The northeast is from tropical to subtropical. Moving west the water and wikt:elevation change, causing a steppe and a desert climate like in the Middle East. There is also a steppe climate in the center of the lower peninsula. Two parts of the South Asian climate especially affect the people. One is the ''monsoon''. These changing winds bring lots of the area's rain, so when they do not come early, the land becomes very dry. Hurricanes also happen every year and sometimes destroy many things and kill and injure people. In the extreme north of India and Pakistan, the climate is affected by the mountains. There is a mild climate near the Indus River where farmers grow crops like rice and tea. The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation is the largest organization here. == Related pages == * Central Asia * East Asia * Southeast Asia * Middle East * Indian subcontinent == References == ==Other websites== * Bhutan Kashmir Maldives Nepal Pakistan Republic of India Sikkim Sri Lanka ''Sometimes included:Afghanistan• Myanmar• Cocos (Keeling) Islands• British Indian Ocean Territory• South Tibet'' }} Category:South Asia
