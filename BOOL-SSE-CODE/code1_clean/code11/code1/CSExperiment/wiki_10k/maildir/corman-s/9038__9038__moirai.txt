File:The Three Fates by Paul Thumann.jpg The '''Moirai''' (also known as '''the Fates''') were the three goddesses of Fate in Greek mythology. They were '''Clotho''', '''Lachesis''' and '''Atropos''' (). The role of the Moirai is to control the fate of every being. The life of each being is represented by a "thread of life". Clotho spins the thread, beginning the being's life. Lachesis measures it (looks how long it is) and Atropos cuts the thread at the end of the person's life once they have reached their destiny, Death them. The Moirai are considered to be above the Greek gods. However, in some stories, Zeus, the Chief God, is capable of controlling them. The decisions of the Moriai about a person's life can't be changed. The parents of the Moirai are not surely known. Some said they were the daughters of Zeus and the Titaness Themis, or more likely of primordial beings like Nyx and Chaos (mythology):en:Ananke. Category:Greek gods and goddesses
