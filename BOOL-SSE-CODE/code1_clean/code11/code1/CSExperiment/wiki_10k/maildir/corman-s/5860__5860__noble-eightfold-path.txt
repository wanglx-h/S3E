In Buddhism, the '''Noble Eightfold Path''' (Pali: ''ariya atthangika magga'') is the path to the end of suffering. It is the fourth part of the Four Noble Truths. It can be summed up in three category: wisdom (''prajna''), virtue (''sila''), and concentration (''samadhi''). It asks for the Right view and the right intention, as well as other things. It also asks for the right speech. Here is a description of the path: # Right Thought - Realizing the Four Noble Truths (samyag-dṛṣṭi, sammā-diṭṭhi) # Right Understanding - Commitment to mental and ethical growth in moderation. # # Right Speech - One speaks in a non hurtful, not exaggerated, truthful way (samyag-vāc, sammā-vācā) # Right Actions - Wholesome action, avoiding action that would do harm (samyak-karmānta, sammā-kammanta) # Right Livelihood - One's job does not harm in any way oneself or others; directly or indirectly (weapon maker, drug dealer, etc.) (samyag-ājīva, sammā-ājīva) # Right Effort - One makes an effort to improve (samyag-vyāyāma, sammā-vāyāma) # Right Mindfulness - Mental ability to see things for what they are with clear consciousness (samyak-smṛti, sammā-sati) # Right Concentration - State where one reaches Nirvana and the ego has disappeared (samyak-samādhi, sammā-samādhi) == Other websites == * [http://www.thebigview.com/buddhism/eightfoldpath.html Notes on the Noble Eightfold Path] * [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/silacara/youngpeoples.html#ch-07 Noble Eightfold Path, in Chapter 7: Success, in "A Young People's Life of the Buddha"] by Bhikkhu Silacara * [http://www.budsas.org/ebud/whatbudbeliev/78.htm The Noble Eightfold Path - The Middle Way] by Ven Dr.K.Sri.Dhammananda * [http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/buddhism/bs-s06.htm The Fourth Noble Truth: The Middle Path: BuddhaNet’s Buddhist Studies for Secondary Students] Category:Religious ethics Category:Buddhist terminology
