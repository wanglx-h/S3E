It is very popular in Spain and is known worldwide. Its foundation is in Andalusia in Spain. In its evolution Romani people in Spain played an important part.See the 3rd definition of the term flamenco in the Dictionary of Real Academia Española. The term 'flamenco' was first recorded in the late 18th century but many believe the art form is much older. Flamenco has acoustic guitar music, singing, hand claps, heel wikt:stamp, castanets. It is danced by a man and a woman in traditional Spanish costumes. The dance has no set tempo. It may have both fast and slow passages, rising to a climax near the end. Flamenco performance has evolved during the history of this musical genre. In the beginning (the 18th century at the latest), songs were sung without any guitar accompaniment. During the 19th century, the guitar was used to accompany songs. Since the second half of the 19th century, the solo guitar is played in flamenco concerts.
