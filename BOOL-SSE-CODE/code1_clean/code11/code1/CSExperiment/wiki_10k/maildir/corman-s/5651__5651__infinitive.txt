The '''infinitive''' is a verb form. It has no person, number, mood, or grammatical tense. == The infinitive in English == In '''English language''', there are two main forms of the infinitive: * the '''full infinitive''' ('''to-infinitive''') has the word ''to'' at the beginning. For example: ''I want '''to run''' '' * the '''bare infinitive''' does not have the word ''to''. For example: ''I must '''go'''''. After a wikt:modal verb you must use an infinitive. For example, ''I must go'', ''he must go'' (''he must goes'' is not correct) To express time relationships, here are 8 types of infinitives: # simple infinitive, for example, ''to write'' # continuous infinitive, for example, ''to be writing'' # perfect infinitive, for example, ''to have written'' # perfect continuous infinitive, for example, ''to have been writing'' # passive simple infinitive, for example, ''to be written'' # passive continuous infinitive, for example, ''to be being writting'' # passive perfect infinitive, for example, ''to have been written'' # passive perfect continuous infinitive, for example, ''to have been being written'' == The infinitive in other languages == * In '''German language''', the infinitives end with ''-en'', ''-eln'' or ''-ern''. There are 2 exceptions - '''' (to be) and '''' (to do). *In '''Esperanto''', the infinitives end with ''-i'', for example '''' (to sleep) == References == Category:Grammar
