Laos is the only landlocked country in Southeast Asia. It is bordered by Myanmar and by China to the northwest, by Vietnam to the east, by Cambodia to the south and by Thailand to the west. The Mekong river forms a part of the western boundary with Thailand. Boats from Laos cannot get to the ocean using the Mekong because of rapids and waterfalls in the south of the country. Laos is the least densely populated country in Southeast Asia, with 32 people per square kilometer. Trains to and from Thailand will start in July 2024; that line has an endpoint in Vientiane Prefecture's Khamsavath railway station.https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2822566/bangkok-vientiane-train-service-begins-july-19.

U.S. forces dropped bombs on Laos, to try to stop the supplies coming thru the Ho Chi Minh trail.[http://e.vnexpress.net/news/travel-life/demystifying-the-secret-war-in-laos-3552815.html "By the mid-60s, Laos had become a theater for the U.S. to cut off the Ho Chi Minh Trail, largely through bombing. They basically viewed their Laotian allies as an anvil to hammer the North Vietnamese. "] South Vietnam was taken (or fell) in April 1975. On May 14, 1975 Vang Pao escaped from Laos, thru the military base at Long Tieng.https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/28/opinion/heirs-of-the-secret-war-in-laos.html?_r=0 ==References== Category:Laos Category:Least developed countries Category:1949 establishments in Asia Category:Current dictatorships
