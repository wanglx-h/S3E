St. Paul, Minnesota and Minneapolis are known as the Twin Cities. As of the 2020 United States census the population was 429,954. The Mississippi River runs through the city. == Etymology == Minneapolis derives from the Dakota word for "water", ''mni,'' and the Greek word for "city" or ''polis.'' Thus, Minneapolis means "City of Waters." A nearby city called St. Anthony then joined with Minneapolis. The first mayor was Dorilus Morrison. == History == The American Indians first lived in Minneapolis around Lake Calhoun and St. Anthony Falls waterfall. They are called the Dakota people. They thought St. Anthony Falls was a spiritual place. Dakota hunted, fished, and planted food. The United States wanted the land in 1803 and bought it with the Louisiana Purchase. The army built Fort Snelling. Soon, people from the East Coast came to Minneapolis. They used the waterfall for their flour mills. They named the new city Minneapolis. == Land and weather == Minneapolis is flat near the river and hilly away from it. The weather is like many places in America with hot summers and cold winters. The winter is very long, very cold, and there is a rainy but short spring. The summer, on the contrary, is humid, meaning a lot of water is in the air. Mosquitos are also common in the city. == People == Minneapolis residents are sometimes known as "Minnesota Nice." That means that they are generally more polite than other people. Most residents of Minneapolis live in houses and apartments, and some now live in tall buildings like condominium. Kids and parents work and play in the city. Many different people make up what is Minneapolis today. After the Dakota Indians were people from Great Britain, French Canada, and Spanish Mexico. They were followed by Scandinavians from Norway, Denmark, and Sweden. Soon people from almost all parts of the world started arriving including Eastern Europe, Russia, and Asia. Today there are people from East Africa (Somalia) and Southeast Asia (Hmong people). Once, Minneapolis was even larger than it is today with 520,000 people. Later, many people moved away to the suburbs. == Work and Shopping == Numerous large companies are located Downtown in skyscrapers. These include lawyers, doctors and bankers. They work near Nicollet Mall where there are restaurants and shops. Minneapolis also has neighborhoods. People there work in small stores too, like barber shops, grocery stores, hardware stores, and coffee shops. Internet is widely available in Minneapolis. == Theater and Art == There are lots of art and shows in the city. The biggest theater is the Guthrie Theater, and the Children's Theatre Company puts on productions directed at younger audiences. There are also art museums, such as the Minneapolis Institute of Arts and the Walker Art Center. == Transportation == Transportation in Minneapolis is mostly handled by Metro Transit (Minnesota). Metro Transit handles transportation in common areas like '''Minneapolis''', Saint Paul, Minnesota, and Bloomington, Minnesota. Metro Transit has busses and trains. Door to door is also offered for disabled or elderly riders. == Sports == Minneapolis hosts lots of sport teams for the state.
