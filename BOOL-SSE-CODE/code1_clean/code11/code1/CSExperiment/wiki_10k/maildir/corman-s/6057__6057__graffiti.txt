The oldest graffiti that used writing was in the Roman Empire, people wrote messages on walls. It wasn't considered vandalism, instead people saw it as just a way to talk to one another. In the 1700s and 1800s in the United States, some people began to write "monikers" on trains. Monikers were pictures and fake names. One famous moniker was Bozo Texino. Modern graffiti was made famous in New York City in the early 1960s and 1970s by the children of the working class. They called it "writing" and called themselves "writers." At first they wrote on trains, but when the New York Subway started to make it harder, writers moved into the city to write on walls instead. In a 1971 New York Times article, Norman Mailer first used the term "graffiti" was first used to refer to the new kind of art people were painting on trains. This period of the early 1970s is known as the "Original School." Later in the 1980s, the next generation of graffiti artists is known as "Old School." == References == == Other websites == * [http://www.graffiti.cx Graffiti.CX Online Graffiti Contest] * [http://graffiti-art-on-trains.blogspot.com Graffiti art on train] * [http://www.graffiti.org.br Graffiti.org.br] * [http://graffitis.over-blog.org Walls & bridges from south Belgium] * [http://www.painters-edmonton.ca/how-to-remove-graffiti/ How to remove graffiti?] * [http://www.painters-edmonton.ca/how-to-remove-from-different-surfaces/ Remove Graffiti From Different Surfaces?] * [https://artscolumbia.org/essays/graffiti-art-vandalism-43288/ Graffiti art or vandalism] Category:Graffiti
