The city is the county seat of Maricopa County, Arizona. It is the largest capital city in the United States and the only capital with over a million people. The city is along the normally dry Salt River (Arizona). It became a city on February 25, 1881. People who live in Phoenix are known as Phoenicians. Phoenix had 1,608,139 people in 2020. It is the fifth-largest city in the United States in the 2020 United States Census. Phoenix is a very spread-out city. It has an area of 515 square miles. This makes it the 10th largest city by area. As of 2020, the Phoenix Metropolitan Area (MSA) was the 11th-largest in the United States, with an estimated 4,845,832 people. == History == === Native Americans === As early as 700 AD, the Hohokam people lived in the land that would become Phoenix. The Hohokam created about 135 miles (217km) of irrigation canals. This let them grow things on the land. It is believed that between AD 1300 and AD 1450 drought and floods caused the Hohokam to no longer live in the area."[http://phoenix.gov/CITYGOV/history.html#EARLY Out of the Ashes, Early Life along the Salt River] ."

Spain and Mexico explorers knew of the area but they did not go as far north as the Salt River Valley. === Early history === In 1867, Jack Swilling of Wickenburg, Arizona came to the area. He saw that the land was good for farming. The only problems he saw were a lack of rain and good irrigation. Swilling corrected the problem by having a series of canals built. A small community was created about four miles (6km) east of the where the city is today. The farming community was named Swilling's Mill. The name was later changed to Helling Mill, Mill City, and East Phoenix. Swilling was a Confederate States Army soldier during the American Civil War. He wanted to name the city "Stonewall," after Stonewall Jackson. Other people had other ideas for names. Finally, Phillip Darrell Duppa suggested the name "Phoenix (mythology)". The name is the same as the mythology fire bird which is born again from its own incineration after it dies. It was a good name for a city born from a former civilization."[http://phoenix.gov/CITYGOV/history.html#BORN Out of the Ashes, Phoenix is Born] ." ''[http://www.phoenix.gov/ City of Phoenix] .''

Monihon, 127 to 107, to become the city's first mayor."[http://phoenix.gov/CITYGOV/history.html#INC Out of the Ashes, Incorporation in 1881] ." ''[http://www.phoenix.gov/ City of Phoenix] .''

It is at a mean elevation of 1,117 feet (340 m), in the northern reaches of the Sonoran Desert. Other than the mountains in and around the city, the topography of Phoenix is mostly flat. This allows the city's main streets to run on a precise wikt:grid with wide, open-spaced roadways. The Salt River runs westward through the city of Phoenix. The riverbed is often dry or just a trickle due to large irrigation usage. The river is full after infrequent rainstorms or when more water is released from upstream dams. The city of Tempe has built two inflatable dams in the Salt River bed to create a year-round recreational lake, called Tempe Town Lake. The dams are deflated to allow the river to flow unimpeded during releases. Lake Pleasant Regional Park is in Northwest Phoenix in the suburb of Peoria, Arizona. As with most of Arizona, Phoenix does not observe daylight saving time. In 1973, Gov. Jack Williams argued to United States Congress that energy use would increase in the evening. Refrigeration units were not used as often in the morning on standard time. He went on to say that energy use would rise "because there would be more lights on in the early morning." He was also concerned about children going to school in the dark, which indeed they were."[http://www.azstarnet.com/sn/printDS/75798 Arizona does not need daylight saving time] ."

The average summer high temperature is among the hottest of any populated area in the United States and approaches those of cities such as Riyadh and Baghdad. The temperature reaches or exceeds 100°Fahrenheit (38°Celsius) on an average of 110 days during the year, including most days from late May through early September, and highs top 110°F (43°C) an average of 21 days during the year. On June 26, 1990, the temperature reached an all-time recorded high of 122°F (50°C). On average, Phoenix has only 2days per year where the temperature drops to or below freezing.[http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/online/ccd/min32temp.html Mean Number of Days With Minimum Temperature or Less] .
