He is one of the people who started Wikipedia and Fandom (website) (previously Wikia).. "''The Wikipedia project was founded in January 2001 by Internet entrepreneur Jimmy Wales and philosopher Larry Sanger,''" quoted from the April 25, 2004 first-ever press release issued by the Wikimedia Foundation.• Wales was born in Huntsville, Alabama, United States. There, he went to Randolph School. He then earned bachelor’s and master’s degree (school)s in finance. In 1996, he and two partners started Bomis. Bomis was an Internet portal with entertainment and adult content. The company gave money for Nupedia (2000–2003) and, after that, Wikipedia. == Personal life == File:Christine and Jimmy Wales.jpg Wales has been marriage three times. He also has three children. When he was 20, Wales married Pam. Pam was a worker at a store in Alabama. He met his second wife, Christine Rohan, through a friend in Chicago. They had a daughter before their marriage ended. Wales moved to San Diego in 1998. In 2002, he moved again to Florida. In 2007, he still lived there. As of 2012 he lives in London, England. In 2012, Wales married Kate Garvey, a government worker for Tony Blair. Wales has three daughters: one with Rohan and two with Garvey. Wales says that he follows the ideas of Objectivism (Ayn Rand). He also says that he is a libertarianism to some extent, meaning that he thinks people should be allowed to do whatever they want so long as they do not hurt others. == Career == On January 15, 2001, with Larry Sanger and others, Wales started Wikipedia. Wikipedia is a free, open content encyclopedia. It grew and became popular very quickly. As Wikipedia became known to the public, he became the project’s promoter and spokesperson. He is often called a co-founder of Wikipedia, though he has argued against the "co-" part. He said he was the only founder. Wales is on the Board of Trustees of the Wikimedia Foundation. In 2004, he co-founded Wikia, a wiki-hosting service which tries to make money. In 2015, Wales started the Jimmy Wales Foundation for Freedom of speech, to try to help bloggers or internet activists who are in prison. == References == Category:1966 births Category:Living people Category:Businesspeople from Alabama Category:Writers from Huntsville, Alabama Category:Wikimedia Foundation Category:Wikipedia people Category:Libertarians Category:British bloggers
