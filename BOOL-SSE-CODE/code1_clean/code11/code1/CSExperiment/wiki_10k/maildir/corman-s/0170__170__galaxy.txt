A '''galaxy''' is a group of many stars, with gas, dust, and dark matter.Sparke L.S. & Gallagher III J.S. 2000. ''Galaxies in the Universe: an introduction''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. ISBN 0521671868.Hupp E; Roy S. & Watzke M. 2006.[http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2006/aug/HQ_06297_CHANDRA_Dark_Matter.html] The name 'galaxy' is taken from the Greek language word ''galaxia'' meaning milky, a reference to our own galaxy, the Milky Way. File:Birds of a feather (50071190086).jpg.]] Gravity holds galaxies together against the general expansion of the universe. In effect, the expansion of the universe takes place between groups of galaxies, not inside those groups. Gravity holds the galaxy together. The same applies to groups and clusters of galaxies, such as our Local Group where the Milky Way is, and the Virgo Cluster, a collection of more than 1,000 (might even be 2,000) galaxies. The gravitation is produced by the matter and energy in a galaxy or group of galaxies. Everything in a galaxy moves around a centre of mass, which is also an effect of gravity. There are various types of galaxies: Elliptical galaxy, Spiral galaxy and lenticular galaxy galaxies, which can all be with or without Barred spiral galaxy. There are also Irregular galaxy galaxies. All galaxies exist inside the universe. The Observable universe contains more than 2 trillion (1012) galaxies and, overall, as many as an estimated stars (more stars than all the Sand on planet Earth). ==Description== There are galaxies of different sizes and type. Typical galaxies range from Dwarf galaxy with as few as ten millionESO 2000: [http://www.eso.org/outreach/press-rel/pr-2000/pr-12-00.html] (107) stars up to giants with a hundred trillionWilford, John Noble 1990.

Galaxies may contain many multiple star systems, star clusters, and various interstellar clouds. The Sun is one of the stars in the Milky Way galaxy; the Solar System includes the Earth and all the other objects that orbit the Sun. Star clusters are not galaxies, they are inside galaxies. Globular clusters are spherical-shaped star clusters which are part of the outer halo of the Milky Way. One of the largest (and oldest) known star clusters, Messier 15, has several million stars, packed closely together, with a black hole at its centre. The stars are too closely packed to get an accurate count, but it certainly has more stars than some of the smaller galaxies. Within galaxy clusters, galaxies move relative to other galaxies. They can and do collide. When this happens, the stars generally move past each other, but gas clouds and dust interact, and can form a burst of new stars. Gravity pulls both galaxies into somewhat new shapes, forming bars, rings or tail-like structures. File:NGC 2997 ESO.jpg Antila, produces new stars at a rate of 1 or 2 stars per year.]] Many galaxies continue to form new generations of stars. The Milky Way, and all spiral shaped galaxies like it (see right side image of NGC 2997), produce new stars at a rate of one or two stars per year. This star formation happens in the vast interstellar clouds that account for about 1% to 10% of the mass of these galaxies. Globular star clusters, on the other hand, are not currently forming stars because this activity happened billions of years ago and then stopped once all of the gas and dust clouds were used up. In the astronomy literature, the word 'Galaxy' with a capital ''G'' is used for our galaxy, the Milky Way. The billions of other galaxies are written as 'galaxy' with a lowercase ''g''. The term ''Milky Way'' first came out in the English language in a poem by Geoffrey Chaucer. }} When William Herschel wrote his wikt:catalogue of deep sky objects, he used the name ''spiral nebula'' for objects like the Andromeda Galaxy. 200 years later astronomers discovered that they are made of stars as the Milky Way is, so the term 'nebula' is now only used for diffuse structures in a galaxy. == Types == File:Hubble sequence photo.png There are two main kinds of galaxies, spiral galaxy and elliptical galaxy. They are classified according to the Edwin Hubble. === Spiral galaxy === File:Hubble2005-01-barred-spiral-galaxy-NGC1300.jpg is a barred spiral galaxy.]] A '''spiral galaxy''' is a galaxy that has a spiral shape. Most of the galaxies in the universe observed by astronomers are spiral galaxies (about 77%). They are divided into two : * Barred spiral galaxy (classified as "SB") * Unbarred spiral galaxy (classified as "SA") NGC 1300 and NGC 1672 are examples of barred spiral galaxies. The Whirlpool galaxy and Messier 81 are examples of unbarred spiral galaxies. The identifying characteristics of a spiral galaxy are disk-shaped rotating, spiral arms, and a bulge in the galactic core. The spiral arms are where new hot stars are born. "Bulge" in the galactic core has old stars. This feature is common to the most spiral galaxies. === Elliptical galaxy === File:ESO 325-G004 in galaxy cluster Abell S0740 (STScI-PRC2007-08).jpg is an elliptical galaxy.]] An '''elliptical galaxy''' is a galaxy that has a ellipsoid (3D of ellipse) shape. This type of galaxy are dominant in universe, especially in galaxy clusters. The shape ranges from circle, ellipse, and cigar-shaped. In Hubble Sequence, this shape can be represented as class : * E0 (circle-shape) * E53 (ellipse-shape) * E7 (cigar-shaped) Elliptical galaxies have a large range in size. The giant elliptical galaxy can be over a more 1 million light years and the smallest (know as "dwarf elliptical galaxy") are less than one-tenth the size of Milky Way The effective radius defines the area from which half its light comes. The mass of elliptical galaxy is also large. A giant elliptical galaxy can have mass of 1013 (many trillions) of solar masses.

The shape of a lenticular galaxy is between spiral galaxy and elliptical galaxy. The shape can be known by looking at the bulge of the galactic center. If the bulge is very bright, it is a spiral galaxy. == Related pages == *List of galaxies *List of nearest galaxies *Most distant things *Local Group *IC 1101: the largest known galaxy, with about 100 trillion stars.https://arxiv.org/PS_cache/astro-ph/pdf/0209/0209205v2.pdf an old supergiant|journal=Science|volume=250|issue=4980|pages=539540|bibcode=1990Sci...250..539U|doi=10.1126/science.250.4980.539|pmid=17751483|s2cid=23362384| issn=0036-8075 }} *Milky Way *Andromeda galaxy == References == == Other websites == * [http://www.seds.org/messier/galaxy.html Galaxies, SEDS Messier pages] * [http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/ An Atlas of The Universe] * [http://www.nightskyinfo.com/galaxies Galaxies — Information and amateur observations] * [http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2002/08feb_gravlens.htm The oldest galaxy yet found] * [http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/inourtime_20060629.shtml Galaxies — discussed on BBC Radio 4's "In Our Time" programme] * [http://www.galaxyzoo.org Galaxy classification project, harnessing the power of the internet and the human brain] * [http://www.physics.org/facts/sand-galaxies.asp How many galaxies are in our universe?] Category:Galaxies
