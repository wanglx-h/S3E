A '''salary''' is a type of payment a person gets for work done for a job. A ''salary'' is usually paid for a fixed period of time, such as a month or a week. Generally, it does not matter how many hours are worked, the salary remains the same. If someone is not a salaried employee, they are generally an "hourly" employee and are paid a certain amount for each hour which is known as "wages." == Related pages == *Minimum wage *Worker Category:Employment Category:Income
