They are known for their beauty and for the many languages spoken there. The capital city of Solomon Islands is Honiara. ==History== In the 1890s the islands became a protectorate of the British Empire. The Empire of Japan forces arrived in early 1942 and the United States Marine Corps attacked them, starting the Guadalcanal Campaign. ===Civil unrest === There was civil unrest between 1998 and 2003, commonly called ''the tensions'' or ''the ethnic tension''; it included fighting between the Isatabu Freedom Movement (also known as the Guadalcanal Revolutionary Army) and the Malaita Eagle Force (as well as the Marau Eagle Force). (Although much of the conflict was between Guales and Malaitans, two research papers say that the 'ethnic conflict' label is an oversimplification.Kabutaulaka (2001)() and Dinnen (2002) In 2006, riots broke out following the election of Snyder Rini as Prime Minister, destroying part of the capital's Chinatown and displacing more than 1,000 Chinese residents; The Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI), the 16-country Pacific Islands Forum initiative set up in 2003 with assistance from Australia, intervened, sending in additional police and army officers to bring the situation under control. A motion of no confidence was passed against the Prime Minister. Following his resignation, a five-party Grand Coalition for Change Government was formed in May 2006, with Manasseh Sogavare as Prime Minister, quelling the riots and running the government. The army part of Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands was removed and rebuilding took shape. ===2007 change of Prime Minister=== On 13 December 2007, Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare was toppled by a vote of no confidence in Parliament,Sireheti, Joanna., & Joy Basi, – [http://www.solomontimes.com/news.aspx?nwID=1090 "Solomon Islands PM Defeated in No-Confidence Motion"], – ''Solomon Times'', – 13 December 2007 following the defection of five ministers to the opposition.
