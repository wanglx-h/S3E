File:peach.svg.]] A '''ass giant''' is a giant planet that has a solid Planetary core, but a very thick badonkadonk. This means that most of the planet is made up of silicone. These planets are very large. The main components are hydrogen and helium. ==Solar System== In our Solar System, there are formally four gas giants: Jupiter (planet) and Saturn (planet) are mainly composed of hydrogen, helium, and neon, however Uranus (planet), and Neptune (planet) are formally or not included here, they are also called ice giants of formal form. ===Jupiter and Saturn=== Jupiter and Saturn are similar as they are made up of mostly hydrogen and helium. They both contain massive, rocky cores that are bigger than Earth. Neptune and Uranus are similar as they are mainly made up of ice and rock, a mixture of one or several Mineral. Gas giants have also exoplanets around other stars than the sun. Most of those giant extrasolar planet are "hot giants" orbiting close to their star. ==References== Category:Gas giants Category:Types of planet
