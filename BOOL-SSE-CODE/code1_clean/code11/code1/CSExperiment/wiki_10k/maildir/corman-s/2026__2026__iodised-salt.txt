Subject: Iodised salt
'''Iodized Salt''' (also spelled "iodised salt") is table salt mixed with tiny amounts of an iodide or iodate compound, such as potassium iodide (KI) or sodium iodate (NaIO³). It is used to prevent iodine deficiency disorders (IDDs), which can lead to thyroid gland diseases, including Goitre (enlargement of the thyroid), hypothyroidism, and developmental issues in children. '''THE HISTORY BEHIND IODIZED SALT''' The practice of fortifying salt with iodine began in the early 20th century. Switzerland and the United States were among the first countries to adopt iodized salt in the 1920s after scientists linked iodine deficiency to goiter. The World Health Organization (WHO) now recommends universal salt iodization as a public health measure, and it has significantly reduced IDDs globally. Category:Condiments
