Its goal is to develop (think and make) different things that use electricity in a helpful way. Electrical engineers fix or design new and better ways of using devices that use electricity. Big subjects in electrical engineering include power generation, automation and control of robots, digital systems, and information technology (using radio and Computer to move and use data). To meet new needs, electrical engineering produced new specialties, such as electronic engineering and software engineering. ==History== Early University taught this as philosophy and later as science. As the Industrial Revolution began they had to start teaching new parts of these sciences to keep up with the demand for new resources. When the industrial era began, we needed to study mathematics, physics and chemistry to help support it. These subjects are "applied" (or, used in the real world) using engineering. In the late 19th century when electricity was used to make Engine and Telegraphy to far away places, a new branch called electrical engineering was invented. When radio became important, many engineers worked at it, and their branch was later expanded to cover electronic engineering. == Other websites == *[http://www.ieee.org IEEE Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers] *[http://www.ieee-virtual-museum.org IEEE Virtual Museum] *[http://eehomepage.com EE HomePage.com Educational & career development resources ] Category:Electrical engineering
