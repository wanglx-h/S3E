She has recorded several albums and has received several entertainment industry awards. ==Early life== Britney Jean Spears was born on December 2, 1981. Her parents are Lynne Irene (née Bridges) and James Parnell Spears. She grew up in Kentwood, Louisiana. One of Spears's maternal great-great-grandfathers was Maltese. Her siblings are Bryan James and Jamie Lynn. She was the middle of three children. She prepared early for a career in entertainment. She took music and dance lessons. She often performed for family and friends. == Personal life == On January 3, 2004, Britney Spears married her childhood friend Jason Allen Alexander in Las Vegas, Nevada. The marriage was annulled 55 hours later. On September 18, 2004, she married Kevin Federline. The couple have two sons, Sean Preston Spears Federline (born September 14, 2005) and Jayden James Spears Federline (born September 12, 2006). Two months after giving birth to her second son, Britney Spears filed for divorce from Federline. In September 2007, she lost some custody of her sons, Sean Preston and Jayden James, to her ex-husband, Federline. At the beginning of January 2008, she lost again the full custody of her children after a mental breakdown. In February 2008, Spears' father took control of her estate. She had 50/50 custody of her two sons until they each reached their 18th birthday, respectively. Her father Jamie has been one of her conservators since 2008. Fans have participated in a movement known as #FreeBritney to raise awareness about Spears' conservatorship arrangement. In 2021, Britney Spears spoke in a courtroom hearing, revealing that she felt controlled by the "abusive" arrangement, in ways such as having an IUD to prevent pregnancy, despite wanting to have another child. She was also sent to a rehab center and was prescribed lithium. Britney Spears also claimed that she did not know she could ask for this conservatorship to be canceled. In July, Britney Spears hired a new lawyer, who filed a petition for Jamie to be removed as a conservator. August of that year, it was revealed that Jamie Spears showed interest in stepping down as one of Britney's conservators. Britney Spears stated in 2012 that she has attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2154960/Britney-Spears-revealed-suffering-ADHD-unable-medication-it.html Britney Spears' ADHD] Britney Spears has been in a relationship with model and fitness coach Sam Asghari since her music video '''Slumber Party'''.
