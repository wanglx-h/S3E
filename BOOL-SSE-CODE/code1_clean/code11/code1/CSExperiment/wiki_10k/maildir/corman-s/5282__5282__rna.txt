This is a single strand of RNA that folds back upon itself. ]] '''RNA''' is an acronym for '''ribonucleic acid''', a nucleic acid. Many different kinds are now known.Only the most important are described here. A complete list is available at :en:List of RNAs. RNA is physically different from DNA. DNA has two Strand that twist around each other, but RNA only has one strand. RNA also has different Nucleotide than DNA. These bases are adenine, guanine, cytosine, and uracil. Adenine bonds with uracil. Guanine bonds with cytosine. In this way, we say that adenine is complementary to uracil and that guanine is complementary to cytosine. Adenine, guanine and cytosine are also in DNA. In RNA, uracil replaces thymine as a complement to adenine. '''RNA''' also has ribose. This is different from the deoxyribose in DNA. These differences result in RNA being more chemically reactive than DNA. This makes it the more suitable molecule to take part in cell reactions. RNA is the carrier of Genetics information in certain viruses, especially retroviruses like HIV. This is the only exception to the general rule that DNA is the Heredity substance. == Protein synthesis RNAs == === Messenger RNA === File:MRNA structure.svg, 5' UTR, coding region, 3' UTR, and poly(A) tail. UTR = untranslated region]] The main function of RNA is to carry information of amino acid sequences from the Gene to ribosomes in the cytoplasm. Ribosomes are where proteins are assembled. This is done by '''messenger RNA''' (mRNA). A strand of DNA is the blueprint for the mRNA which is Transcription (genetics) from that DNA strand. The sequence of base pairs is Transcription (genetics) from DNA by an enzyme called RNA polymerase. Then the mRNA moves from the nucleus to the ribosomes in the cytoplasm to form Protein. The mRNA translates the sequence of base pairs into a sequence of amino acids to form proteins. This is called Translation (genetics). DNA does not leave the nucleus for many reasons. DNA is a very long molecule, and is bound in with proteins, called histones, in the chromosomes. mRNA is able to move and react with many cell enzymes. The mRNA leaves the nucleus and moves to the ribosomes after it is transcribed. Two kinds of non-coding RNAs help in the process of building proteins in the cell. They are transfer RNA (tRNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA). === tRNA === Transfer RNA ('''tRNA''') is a short molecule of about 80 nucleotides which carries a specific amino acid to the polypeptide chain (the protein being made) at a ribosome. There is a different tRNA for each amino acid. Each one has a site for the amino acid to attach and an anti-codon to match the codon on the mRNA. For example, codons UUU or UUC code for the amino acid phenylalanine. === rRNA === '''Ribosomal RNA''' ('''rRNA''') is the Catalysis component of the ribosomes. Eukaryote ribosomes contain four different rRNA molecules: 18S, 5.8S, 28S and 5S rRNA. Three of the rRNA molecules are synthesized in the nucleolus, and one is synthesized elsewhere. In the cytoplasm, ribosomal RNA and protein combine to form a nucleoprotein called a ribosome. The ribosome binds mRNA and carries out protein synthesis. Several ribosomes may be attached to a single mRNA at any time. rRNA is extremely abundant and makes up 80% of the 10mg/ml RNA found in a typical eukaryotic cytoplasm. === snRNAs === Small nuclear RNAs ('''snRNA''') join with proteins to form spliceosomes. The spliceosomes govern alternative splicing. Genes code for proteins in bits called exons. The bits can be joined together in different ways to make different mRNAs. Thus, from one gene many proteins can be made. This is the process of alternative splicing. Any unwanted versions of the protein get chopped up by proteases, and the chemical bits re-used. == Regulatory RNAs == There are a number of RNAs which regulate genes, that is, they regulate the rate at which genes are transcribed or translated. === miRNA === Micro RNAs (miRNA) act by joining an enzyme and blocking mRNA or speeding its breakdown. This is called RNA interference.[https://web.archive.org/web/20070120113455/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2006/adv.html The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2006.

They are quite small (20/25 nucleotides) double-stranded molecules. Their discovery has caused a surge in biomedical research and drug development. First description of siRNAs. == Parasitic and other RNAs == === Retrotransposons === Transposon are only one of several types of mobile genetic elements. Retrotransposons copy themselves in two stages: first from DNA to RNA by Transcription (genetics), then from RNA back to DNA by reverse transcription. The DNA copy is then inserted into the genome in a new position. Retrotransposons behave very similarly to retroviruses, such as HIV. === Viral genomes === Viral genomes, which are usually RNA, take over the cell machinery and make both new viral RNA and the protein coat of the virus. === Phage genomes === Phage genomes are quite varied. The genetic material can be '''ssRNA''' (single-stranded RNA), '''dsRNA''' (double-stranded RNA), '''ssDNA''' (single-stranded DNA), or '''dsDNA''' (double-stranded DNA). It may be between 5 and 500 kilo base pairs long with either circular or linear arrangement. Bacteriophages are usually between 20 and 200 nanometers in size. Phage genomes may code for as few as four genes,Bacteriophage MS2 and as many as hundreds of genes. ==Uses== Some scientists and doctors have used messenger RNA vaccines to treat cancer and prevent people from becoming sick. == References == Category:RNA Category:Cell biology Category:Macromolecules
