Subject: Euclidean algorithm
The '''Euclidean algorithm''' is an algorithm. It can be used to find the biggest number that divides two other numbers (the greatest common divisor of two numbers). == What the algorithm looks like in words == Euclid solved the problem graphically. He said :''If you have two distances, AB and CD, and you always take away the smaller from the bigger, you will end up with a distance that measures both of them''. == The algorithm as an enumerated list == Start out with two positive integers ''m'' and ''n''. # If the value of ''m'' is less than the value of ''n'', switch the values of ''m'' and ''n'' # Find a number ''r'' equal to ''m'' modulo ''n'' # Let ''m'' have the same value as ''n'' # Let ''n'' have the same value as ''r'' # If ''n'' does not have the value of 0, go to step 2 # The wanted value is in ''m''. == The algorithm in pseudocode == '''Note:''' This pseudocode uses modular arithmetic instead of subtraction. It does the same thing as above, but gets the answer faster. Precondition: two positive integers ''m'' and ''n'' Postcondition: the greatest common integer divisor of ''m'' and ''n'' if m == C/C++ source code == '''Iterative (Non-recursive):''' int euclid_gcd(int m, int n) { int temp = 0; if(m '''Recursive:''' int euclid_gcd_recur(int m, int n) { if(n == 0) return m; return euclid_gcd_recur(n, m % n); } Category:Algorithms Category:Number theory
