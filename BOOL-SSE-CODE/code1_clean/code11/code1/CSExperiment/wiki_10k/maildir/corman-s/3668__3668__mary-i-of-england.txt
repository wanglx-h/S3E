She was the oldest daughter of Henry VIII and the only child of Katherine of Aragon who survived childhood. Mary succeeded her short-lived half-brother, Edward VI of England, to the English throne. She was the fourth crowned monarchy of the Tudor dynasty. Mary is remembered for briefly remaking England a Roman Catholicism country. Mary had more than 280 disagreeing religion people burned at the stake, which are recorded in John Foxe's ''Book of Martyrs''. That made many call her "'''Bloody Mary'''". Her half-sister on her father's side, Elizabeth I of England, came to the throne after Mary's death. Elizabeth made England Protestantism again and persecuted Catholics who were viewed as traitors. == Early life == Mary Tudor was born on 18 February 1516 in the Palace of Placentia, in Greenwich. Unlike Catherine's other children, she survived to be an adult. Her godfather was Cardinal Thomas Wolsey. In 1521, the five-year-old Mary was betrothed to the three year old Duke of Brittany, Francis. Although she was not the son and heir that Henry VIII wanted, she was loved by her parents. When she was about 11, Henry decided to divorce Mary's mother, Catherine of Aragon so that he could marry Anne Boleyn. After Anne Boleyn had a daughter, Elizabeth I, Henry VlII distrusted Mary and thought that her behaviour came from her mother and so he purposefully separated Mary and Catherine of Aragon. He also banished both of them from court and removed Mary from the order of succession. Mary had to become one of her servants. After Henry had Anne killed, Mary's half-sister also became a servant. A month later, Henry VIII married Jane Seymour, who gave birth to Edward VI of England. Twelve days later, Jane died. == Succession == Mary lost a faithful friend and also her pride. She had acknowledged her parents' marriage as invalid and herself an Legitimacy daughter. The rest of Mary's life with Henry VIII gave her a quick succession of stepmothers. Henry VIII died soon after marrying his last wife, Catherine Parr. Henry had decided that the young prince was to succeed him. If he had no heirs, his older half-sister, Mary, was to be queen. == Becoming Queen == If Mary did not produce a child, Mary's half-sister, Elizabeth, was to be queen. After Elizabeth and her heirs would be the side of the family of Henry's sister Mary. Edward succeeded to the throne as King of England and Ireland. Edward began to show signs of a coughing disease. File:Pantoja de la Cruz after Titian - Charles V in Armour.jpg, Mary’s cousin and later father-in-law]] Edward did not want Mary to succeed him. Edward went ahead with a plan to let his Protestant cousin Lady Jane Grey become queen after he died. She was queen of England for only nine days. Mary executed her and married Philip II of Spain. After Mary died, Elizabeth succeeded to the throne and became Queen Elizabeth I of England. == Children == Mary had two phantom pregnancies, or false pregnancies, but had no child. The phantom pregnancies were liver cancer. After Mary died, Elizabeth succeeded to the throne and became Queen Elizabeth I of England. {| class="wikitable" |+ !Name !Time |- |Phantom pregnancy | |- |Phantom pregnacy | |} == References == Category:1516 births Category:1558 deaths Category:House of Tudor Category:Counts and countesses of Flanders Category:Kings and Queens of England Category:Kings and Queens consort of Spain Category:English Roman Catholics Category:16th century in England Category:Heirs and heiresses presumptive
