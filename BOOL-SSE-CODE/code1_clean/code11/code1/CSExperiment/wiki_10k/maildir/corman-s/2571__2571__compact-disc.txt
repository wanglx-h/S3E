CDs replaced floppy disks and Gramophone record because they were faster and could hold more information. The CD was invented by both Philips and Sony at the same time. Sony and Philips did work together to create a standard format and the technology to read a CD in 1982 (Japan) and 1983 (outside Japan). The CD can store up to 700 Megabyte worth of data, which is about 74-80 Minute of music. The Mini CD has an 8 cm diameter with less music/data storage capacity than the CD of 12 cm.
