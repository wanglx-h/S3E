Subject: Lord Protector
A '''Lord Protector''' is a British title for head of state. It has two different meanings at different times in history. The title of ''Lord Protector'' was first used by royal princes or other nobles who ruled as regent while the English monarch was still too young to rule or was not able to rule for some other reason, in this case the Lord Protector would make all the decisions for the country, and the young monarch would decide whether they agree or not. The '''Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland''' was the title of the head of state during the English Interregnum, following the first period of the Commonwealth of England under English Council of State government. It was held by Oliver Cromwell (December 1653 – September 1658), leader of the roundheads and his son Richard Cromwell (September 1658 – May 1659) during what is now known as the The Protectorate. == List of Lord Protectors == {| class="wikitable" |+ !Name !Image !House !Birth !Marriage !Death |- |Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester (1422-1429) | |Lancaster |3 October 1390 son of Henry IV of England |Jacqueline, Countess of Hainaut no children Eleanor, Duchess of Gloucester no children |23 February 1447 |- |Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York (1454-1460) | |House of Plantagenet |21 September 1411 Great-grandson of Edward III of England |Cecily Neville, Duchess of York twelve children |1 January 1461 |- |Richard III of England (1483) | |York |2 October 1451 son of Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York and Great-Great-grandson of Edward III of England |Anne Neville one son |22 August 1485 |- |Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset (1547-1549) | |Seymour |1500 |Catherine Fillol Anne Seymour, Duchess of Somerset |22 January 1552 |} Category:Heads of state Category:Titles
