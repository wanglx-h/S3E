In some places they are called '''Spring of Nations''' or the '''Year of Revolution'''. These revolutions started in January with a Palermo republican uprising. The larger French Revolution of 1848 in February was followed in March by several other revolutions amongst them the Hungary Revolution of 1848 and the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states. In Ireland, the rebellions began because of famine conditions in their country. People in the various countries tried to take over their governments. ==References== Category:1848 in Europe
