File:Panthera tigris virgata.jpg The '''Caspian tiger''' (''Panthera tigris virgata'') is an extinction sub subspecies of the tiger. It was the most western subspecies of the tiger, very close to Europe. They became extinct in the 1970s. They were found in Turkey, Armenia, Iraq, Azerbaijan, Iran, Mongolia, and Georgia (country). Recent research by scientists looking at the tiger's DNA, have found that it is almost identical to the Siberian tiger. They now believe that the two species of tiger may not have become separate until the 1900s. ==Description== The Caspian tiger was the third largest of the tiger species with male specimens weighing between 204-249 kgs (450-550 lbs) and was 1.4 meters tall (4'6 ft) and was 2.4 meters (8 ft). It had small, short ears. The color was different from other tiger subspecies, with yellow to gold fur with light to dark brown stripes. The chest and stomach area are white with yellow stripes. In winter it grew longer fur. It was the furriest of all the tiger subspecies. ==References== Category:Tigers Category:Mammals of Pakistan Category:Extinct mammals
