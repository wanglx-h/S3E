:''Not to be confused with building extensions which are also called additions.'' File:Addition.gif In mathematics, '''addition''', represented by the symbol +, is an operation which combines two mathematical objects together into another mathematical object of the same type, called the sum. Addition can occur with simple objects such as numbers, and more complex objects and concepts such as vectors and Matrix (mathematics). Addition has several important properties. It is Commutative property, meaning that the order of the operands does not matter, and it is Associativity, meaning that when one adds more than two numbers, the order in which addition is performed does not matter (see ''Summation''). Repeated addition of 1 (number) is the same as counting. Addition of 0 (number) does not change a number. Addition also obeys predictable rules concerning related operations such as Operation (mathematics)#Subtraction and Operation (mathematics)#Multiplication. == Arithmetic == In arithmetic, addition is the operation where two or more numbers called "addends" are used to make a new number, which is the "sum" or total that is expressed with the equals sign. The symbol for addition, in infix notation, is the plus sign "+" placed between the operands. File:AdditionShapes.svgs + 3 shapes = 5 shapes]] === Counting examples === For example, there are wikt:object in two groups (as shown on the right). The objects are various shapes, where one group has 3 of them while the other has 2. When the two groups combine into one, the overall amount (sum) of the shapes become 5. ==== Vertical Addition ==== The animation above demonstrates the addition of seven hundred eighty six and four hundred sixty seven. The problem's digits have been separated into units, tens and hundreds (see Place value). First, the units 6 and 7 are added together to make 13, so 1 ten and 3 units, with the 3 written below and the 1 ten carried to the tens column. Next, in the tens column, the 1, 8, and 6 are added together to make 15 tens, so 1 hundred and 5 tens, with the 5 written below and the 1 hundred carried to the hundreds column. Finally, in the hundreds column, 1, 7, and 4 are added together to make 12 hundreds, so 1 thousand and 2 hundreds, with the 2 written below and the 1 thousand carried to the thousand column. The final answer is thus one thousand two hundred fifty three. === A measurement example === Tom wants to know the distance between his house and Sally's house. Bob's house is 300Metre east of Tom's house. Sally's house is 120m east of Bob's house: :Tom's house \leftarrow 300m \rightarrow Bob's house \leftarrow 120m \rightarrow Sally's house The distance from Tom's house to Sally's house can be found by adding the distances already measured. The distance from Tom's house to Bob's house, added to the distance from Bob's house to Sally's house, is the same as the distance from Tom's house to Sally's house. That is, 300 m plus 120m. :300+120=420 Hence Sally's house is 420m to the east of Tom's house. == Properties == === Commutativity === File:AdditionComm01.svg Addition is Commutative property, meaning that one can change the order of the numbers in a sum, but still get the same result. For example: :4+5=9 and 5+4=9 === Associativity === File:AdditionAsc.svg Addition is also associativity, which means that when three or more numbers are added together, the order of operations does not change the result. For any three numbers a, b, and c, it is true that 1=(a+b)+c=a+(b+c). For example, 1=(1+2)+3=3+3=6 and 1=1+(2+3)=1+5=6, which means that 1=(1+2)+3=1+(2+3). When addition is used together with other operations, the order of operations becomes important. In the standard order of operations, addition is to be computed later than Operation (mathematics)#Exponentiation, Operation (mathematics)#Roots, Operation (mathematics)#Multiplication and Operation (mathematics)#Division, but has equal importance as Operation (mathematics)#Subtraction. == Addition table == == Related pages == * Operation (mathematics) * Identity element * Order of operations * Hyperoperation == References == == Other websites == * [https://www.aaamath.com/add.html AAA Math: Addition] Category:Basic English 850 words Category:Hyperoperations
