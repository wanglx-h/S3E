Subject: Tentacle
A '''tentacle''' is a part of the body of an animal or plant that can move freely. They are like arms. Some invertebrates, like squid, sea anemones or Hydra (animal) have them. They use the tentacles to catch food, or to grip the surroundings. Some carnivore plants, such as the Drosera, also may have tentacles. Category:Animal anatomy
