It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.UNESCO, [http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/409 "Hawaii Volcanoes National Park"]; retrieved 2012-4-19. The park was created in 1916. It includes The Mauna Loa, which is the Earth's biggest volcano, and Kilauea, the Earth's most active volcano. The park shows the results of millions of years of volcanism, and evolution. These processes produce bare land from the sea, and with complex and unique ecosystems, a distinct Ancient Hawaiian culture. Kīlauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, and Mauna Loa is the biggest, it offers scientists with insights on the birth of the Hawaiian Islands, and can give visitors views of the dramatic volcanic landscapes. In recognition of its outstanding natural values, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park has been designated as an International Biosphere Reserve in 1980 and a World Heritage Site in 1987. ==Recent events== On March 19, 2008, there was a small explosion in Halemaumau crater, the first explosive event since 1924 and the first eruption in the Kīlauea caldera since September 1982. Debris from the explosion was scattered over an area of . A small amount of ash was also reported at a nearby community. The explosion covered part of Crater Rim Drive and damaged Halemaumau overlook. The explosion did not release any lava, which suggests to scientists that it was driven by hydrothermal or gas sources.[http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/pressreleases/pr03_19_08.html Explosive eruption in Halemaumau Crater, Kilauea Volcano.] This explosion event followed the opening of a major sulfur dioxide gas vent, greatly increasing levels emitted from the Halemaumau crater. In 2008, Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park and Jeju Volcanic Island and Lava Tubes became sister parks. ==Gallery== File:Lava HI 2005.jpg|Walking across the cooled lava File:Puu Oo cropped.jpg|Lava erupting from the vent at Halemaumau == Related pages == *List of World Heritage Sites in the United States == References == ==Other websites== Category:Geography of Hawaii Category:National parks in the United States Category:World Heritage Sites in the United States Category:1916 establishments in the United States Category:20th-century establishments in Hawaii
