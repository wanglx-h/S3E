'''Crius''' or '''Krios''' (Ancient Greek: Κρεῖος or Κριός) is one of the Twelve Titan (mythology), the son of Gaia (mythology) and Uranos. The Titan god of the constellations, Krios ruled over the southern corner of the world, which he received as a reward for his part in Uranos castration (he held down one of Ouranos’ arms). Like his brothers, Krios was cast into Tartaros at the end of the Titanomachy. His wife was the minor goddess Eurybia (mythology), daughter of Pontus (mythology) and Gaia, with whom he sired Astraeus, Pallas, and Perses (Titan). Category:Titans
