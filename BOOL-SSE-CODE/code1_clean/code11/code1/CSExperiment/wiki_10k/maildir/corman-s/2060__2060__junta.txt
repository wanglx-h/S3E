Subject: Junta
A '''junta''' is a Spanish language word that is used for military dictatorships. Often juntas got their power because of a coup d'état. Juntas are different from other dictatorships because they are ruled by a group of military officers instead of one person. Greece, Argentina, Chile, Mauritania, Guatemala, Brazil, South Vietnam, and El Salvador are examples of countries that were once ruled by juntas. The most famous junta nowadays is that of Myanmar. Some autonomous regional governments in Spain are also called '''junta'''. Category:Military Category:Dictatorship
