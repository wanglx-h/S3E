He was educated at the University of Sussex and the University of East Anglia, where he was the first graduate of Malcolm Bradbury's pioneering creative writing course. He has been married twice. His second wife, Annalena McAfee, is the editor of the Guardian's Review section. In March and April 2004, just months after the United Kingdom government had invited him to a dinner with First Lady of the United States Laura Bush, McEwan was denied entry into the United States by the United States Department of Homeland Security for not having the proper visa for earning a living (McEwan was preparing to give a series of paid lectures). Only after several days and publicity in the British press was McEwan admitted because, as he said a customs official had told him, "We still do not want to let you in, but this is attracting a lot of unfavourable publicity." He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was awarded the Shakespeare Prize by the Alfred Toepfer Foundation, Hamburg, in 1999. He was awarded a Order of the British Empire in 2000. == Works == His first published work was the collection of short stories ''First Love, Last Rites'' (1975), which won the Somerset Maugham Award in 1976. ''The Cement Garden'' (1978) and ''Black Dogs'' (1992) were his early novels. His 1997 novel, ''Enduring Love'', about a person with de Clerambault's syndrome, is regarded by many as a masterpiece, though ''Atonement (novel)'' has received equally high acclaim. In 1998, he was controversially awarded the Booker Prize for his novella, ''Amsterdam (novel)''. His 2005 novel, ''Saturday (novel)'', follows an especially eventful day in the life of a neurosurgery. Mr Henry Perowne, the main character, lives in a house on a square in central London where McEwan himself lives after relocating from Oxford. The 2007 novel, ''On Chesil Beach (novel)'', was a short novel about one couple in England and how they experience love and sexuality in the early 1960s. The novel was on the short list of possible Booker Prize winners. His most recent novel, ''Solar (novel)'', is a comedy. A fictional Nobel Prize winning physicist with a disorganized personal life is the main character. == Bibliography == === Novels === * ''The Cement Garden'' (1978, filmed in 1993) * ''The Comfort of Strangers'' (1981, The Comfort of Strangers (film) in 1990) * ''The Child in Time'' (1987) * ''The Innocent (novel)'' (1989, filmed in 1993) * ''Black Dogs'' (1992) * ''Enduring Love'' (1997, filmed in 2004) * ''Amsterdam (novel)'' (1998) * ''Atonement (novel)'' (2001) * ''Saturday (novel)'' (2005) * ''On Chesil Beach (novel)'' (2007) === Short fiction collections === * ''First Love, Last Rites'' (1975) * ''In Between the Sheets'' (1978) === Children's fiction === * ''Rose Blanche'' (1985) * ''The Daydreamer'' (1994) === Plays === * ''The Imitation Game'' (1981) === Screenplays === * ''Ploughman's Lunch'' (1985) * ''Sour Sweet'' (1989) * ''The Good Son'' (1993) === Oration === * ''or Shall We Die?''
