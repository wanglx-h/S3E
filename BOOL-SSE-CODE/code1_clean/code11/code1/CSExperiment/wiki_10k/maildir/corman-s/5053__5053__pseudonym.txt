Pseudonyms can include stage names, stage name, stage name, pen names, nicknames, wikt:aliases, superhero wikt:identity and code names. Many people use pseudonyms, including Author (pen names) and performers (Stage (theatre) names). Some use pseudonyms to hide their identity, gender, and/or race (sociology). Performers (like rap) sometimes use pseudonyms to match their stage personalities better. ''Pseudonym'' comes from the Greek language word (''pseudṓnymon''), which means "false name". ==Types of pseudonyms== === Pen names === Pen names are pseudonyms used by authors, usually to hide identity. Many famous books have been written by authors using pseudonyms. For example, Daniel Handler wrote A Series of Unfortunate Events under the pseudonym Lemony Snicket for two reasons. He wanted to make the author a character in the story, and he wanted to hide his real name. When she published The Outsiders, Susan Eloise Hinton used the initials S. E. because she did not want readers to guess her gender. The Brontë sisters (Anne Brontë, Emily Brontë and Charlotte Brontë) used pseudonyms to hide the fact that they based many of their characters on their wikt:neighbor. Other famous pen names include: * Dr. Seuss for children's author Theodor Seuss Geisel * George Orwell for Eric Arthur Blair, who wrote Nineteen Eighty-Four and Animal Farm * Mark Twain for American author Samuel Langhorne Clemens, who wrote Adventures of Huckleberry Finn * Lewis Carroll for British writer Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, who wrote Alice's Adventures in Wonderland * Voltaire for French Age of Enlightenment writer and philosopher François-Marie Arouet === Stage names === Many musicians, Actor and Performer use Stage name. These can hide the performer's identity; give them a more interesting name; make them stand out more; and/or create a unique artistic image.

For this reason, a performer might need to adopt an "alternate professional name" before they can join SAG-AFTRA. Famous stage names include: * Banksy, an anonymous Street art * Bono for Paul Hewson, lead singer of U2 * Diddy for Hip hop Sean Combs (formerly called P Diddy and Puff Daddy) * Jamie Foxx for American actor and comedian Eric Marlon Bishop * Mata Hari for Dutch people Striptease and Espionage Margaretha MacLeod === Usernames === Many people on the Internet use pseudonyms. There are many names for these pseudonyms, including usernames, user IDs and handles. These pseudonyms help people stay Anonymity on the internet, and they also protect people from identity theft and phishing. When people log into an account on sites like Wikipedia, Reddit, or Facebook, their username helps identify them without entering their real name. If people used their real name instead of a username, it would create confusion for two people with the same name. Usernames make this simple, because people create their own usernames. Also, if someone used their real name, it would make it easier for people to guess their wikt:password and for other people to find them in real life. === Criminal pseudonyms === Sometimes Crime choose pseudonyms to hide their real names. In other cases, criminals take on nicknames given to them by others.
