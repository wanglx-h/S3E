PHP code is run on the Server (the website's computer). It is called a 'preprocessor'' because it builds the information before sending it to the computer that visits the web page. A website programmed with PHP can have pages that are password protected. A website without PHP or similar technologies can't do this, as the visitor can find a way to access the page. For example, by finding where the password is stored. Standard PHP file extensions are (but not only): .php, .php3, and .phtml, but a web server can be set up to use any extension.http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_intro.asp Retrieved on 30 October, 2007 Its structure was influenced by many languages like C programming language, Perl, Java programming language, C++, and even Python (programming language). It is considered to be free software by the Free Software Foundation. Multiple PHP frameworks are available today, such as Laravel, Symfony, CodeIgniter, and Phalcon, which offer developers a more structured approach via pre-built components and the ability to streamline the process. Laravel is currently the only PHP framework used in the development of more than 1,723,068 websites globally.
