The grid plan for its streets is less orderly than in parts of Manhattan that were built later. == History == File:Greenwich Village map circa 1760 - Project Gutenberg eText 16907.jpg The village is located on what used to be marshland. In the 16th century, Native Americans called it ''Sapokanikan'' which means ''tobacco field''. In the 1630s, it was turned into pasture by the Dutch, who called it ''Noortwyck''.
