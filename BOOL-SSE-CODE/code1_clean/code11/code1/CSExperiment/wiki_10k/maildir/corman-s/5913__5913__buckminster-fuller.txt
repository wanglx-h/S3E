The best known of which is the geodesic dome, the pinnacle of which would be a 5 kilometer diameter dome over Manhattan, as well as cloud nine. Carbon molecules known as fullerenes were later named by scientists for their resemblance to geodesic spheres. == Some of his books == * ''Nine chains to the Moon'' (1938) * ''Untitled epic poem on the history of industrialization'' (1962) * ''Ideas and integrities, a spontaneous autobiographical disclosure'' (1963) * ''No more secondhand god and other writings'' (1963) * ''What I have learned: a collection of 20 autobiographical essays'', Chapter "How little I know", (1968) * ''Operating manual for Spaceship Earth'' (1969) * ''Utopia or oblivion'' (1969) * ''Approaching the benign environment'' (1970) (with Eric A.
