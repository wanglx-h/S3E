File:Chupacabras.svg File:Chupacabra (artist's rendition).jpg File:Chupacabra padayachee.jpg '''El Chupacabra''' (or '''El Chupacabras''') is a cryptid said to live in Puerto Rico, Mexico, Chile, Brazil, Anaheim California. Gilbert Arizona. Texas to Florida, Michigan, Maine and even Oregon. Its name comes from the Spanish language translation of "goat sucker", because of its habit of attacking and drinking the blood of livestock, including goats. The legend was started in 1987 when there was a huge, gruesome massacre of livestock all over. All the animals had two puncture wounds on their neck in which the blood had been drained. The story of the Chupacabra has even made it into a German English textbook (Green Line 4, published by Ernst Klett Verlag) as an example for the kind of not always reliable and unverified information that may be found on the Internet. == Related pages == * Bigfoot ==References== Category:Cryptozoology
