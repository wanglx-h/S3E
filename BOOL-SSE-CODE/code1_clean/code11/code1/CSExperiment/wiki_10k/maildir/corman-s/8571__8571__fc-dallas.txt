To save money the club played its 2003 home games at Dragon Stadium, a high school stadium in Southlake, Texas, a Fort Worth suburb. The club lost money in the high school stadium because Texas law does not allow the sale of Alcoholic drink on a public high school campus. The team moved back to the Cotton Bowl for the 2004 season. In August 2005, the club moved into Toyota Stadium (Texas), a soccer stadium in the northern suburb of Frisco, Texas. The contract that allowed Pizza Hut to put its name on the stadium ended in January 2012, and the stadium was renamed FC Dallas Stadium. In September 2013, a new sponsorship contract was signed with Toyota, and the stadium was renamed Toyota Stadium. Following renovations to the south end of Toyota Stadium, the relocated National Soccer Hall of Fame opened at the stadium in October 2018. ==References== ==Other websites== * [http://www.fcdallas.com Official Homepage] Category:American soccer teams Category:Sports in Dallas Category:Major League Soccer teams Category:1996 establishments in the United States Category:1990s establishments in Texas
