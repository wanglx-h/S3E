The federal constitutional monarchy consists of thirteen states and three federal territories, separated by the South China Sea into two regions, Peninsular Malaysia and Borneo's East Malaysia. Peninsular Malaysia shares a land and maritime border with Thailand and maritime borders with Singapore, Vietnam, and Indonesia. East Malaysia shares land and maritime borders with Brunei and Indonesia and a maritime border with the Philippines and Vietnam. Kuala Lumpur is the national capital, largest city and the seat of the legislative branch of the federal government. The nearby planned capital of Putrajaya was the administrative capital; which represents the seat of both the executive branch (Cabinet, federal ministries and agencies) and the judicial branch of the federal government. With a population of over 34 million, Malaysia is the world's 43rd-most populous country. The southernmost point of continental Eurasia is in Tanjung Piai. In the tropics, Malaysia is one of 17 megadiverse countries, home to a number of endemic species. The country is multi-ethnic and multi-cultural, with most people being Malays (ethnic group), but there are also Chinese people and Indians. Its official language is Malay language written in the Latin alphabet. English language is a recognised language and also the official language in Sarawak state along with Malay. Tamil language and Chinese language is also often used. There are over 130 other languages spoken in Malaysia, with 94 in Malaysian Borneo and 40 on the peninsula. Islam is the official religion, but non-Malay citizens have the freedom to practice other religions. == History == Between China and India, Malaysia was an ancient trading place. When Europeans came to this area, Malacca was already an important trade port. Several Sultanates rose and fell during the time between the fall of Malacca and when Penang became a colony in 1786. The states of Malaysia became a colony of the United Kingdom, starting with Penang in 1786. The peninsular part became independent on 31 August 1957 as the Federation of Malaya. In September 1963, Malaya, Singapore and the Borneo part joined to become Malaysia. The creation of Malaysia, led to a Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation as well as conflicts against the Communists in Borneo and the Malay Peninsula, which escalation to the Sarawak Communist Insurgency and Second Malayan Emergency. The Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation was an armed conflict that started in 1963. In April that year, a force that was trained by Indonesian authorities, crossed into Sarawak and attacked a police station in Tebedu ([https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7447739 map]). In 1965, Singapore was expelled from the federation and declared independence. During Mahathir Mohamad's time as Prime Minister of Malaysia from 1981 to 2003, the country grew a lot. He helped the economy grow fast by building industries and attracting foreign money. Mahathir also focused on making big buildings like the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur. The 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal in 2015 was a big corruption case that involved then-Prime Minister Najib Razak. It led to the first change in Malaysia's ruling political party since independence in the 2018 Malaysian general election. == Politics and Economy == Malaysia has 13 states, which are Johor, Kedah, Kelantan, Melaka, Negeri Sembilan, Pahang, Perak, Perlis, Penang, Sabah, Sarawak, Selangor and Terengganu, and three federal territories, Kuala Lumpur, Putrajaya and Labuan. The number of points of the star on the flag represents the number of states Malaysia has, but it has 14 because Singapore was one of the states in Malaysia during its creation. The 14th point now represents the federal territories, called Wilayah Persekutuan. The head of state of Malaysia is known as the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, otherwise called the "King of Malaysia". That title is currently held by Sultan Ibrahim Iskandar of Johor. Malaysia's head of government is the Prime Minister. Its current prime minister is Anwar Ibrahim. It also has a parliament and a Judiciary. It is a founding member of ASEAN. Malaysia is considered an upper-middle income economy by the World Bank. Malaysia is known for its openness to trade with 40% of jobs in export activities. After the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997, the economy of Malaysia has continued to grow at an average rate of 5.4% since 2010. In 2017, the biggest economic sector is the services sector (53.6%), followed by the manufacturing sector (37.6%) with the agriculture sector (8.8%) being the smallest. ==Cities== The following is a list of places in Malaysia.

The Malays, which form the largest community, are all Muslims since one has to be Muslim to be legally Malay under Malaysian law. The Malays play a dominant role politically and are included in a grouping identified as Bumiputera. === Food and drink === Many cultures from within the country and from surrounding areas have influenced the cuisine. Much of the influence comes from the Malay, Chinese, Indian, Thailand, Javanese, and Sumatran cultures, largely because the country was part of the ancient spice route. Food from one culture is sometimes also cooked using ways taken from another culture, for example, shrimp paste (belacan) and sambal are commonly used by Chinese restaurants for cooking. This means that although much of Malaysian food can be traced back to a certain culture, they have their own identity. Rice is popular in many dishes. Chili is commonly found in local cuisine, although this does not necessarily make them spicy. Examples of Malaysian food are laksa, which is a spicy noodle dish common in Malaysia and teh tarik, which is a popular drink. == Sports == Malaysia's national sports center is the Bukit Jalil Sports Complex. Nicol David (squash) and Lee Chong Wei (badminton) are notable athletes from Malaysia.

The longest highway of the country, the North-South Expressway, extends over 800kilometres (497mi) between the Thai border and Singapore. The road systems in Sabah and Sarawak are less developed and of lower quality in comparison to that of Peninsular Malaysia. Malaysia has 118 airports, of which 38 are paved.
