It is on the north-eastern coast of Estonia and borders the Gulf of Finland. The city is next to many lakes. The largest of these lakes is called Lake Ülemiste, and most Tallinnites get their drinking water from this lake. Old Town of Tallinn, which is the historic town center, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. == History == Tallinn first appeared on a map in 1154, when the cartography Muhammad al-Idrisi, calling the city ''Qlwn'', added it to his map of the world. After being conquered by the Denmark, the city was known as '''''Reval''''' until Estonia became an independent nation in the 1920s. In 1285, the city became a part of the Hanseatic League. As a result, in the Middle Ages Tallinn was an important stop on the trade routes between Europe and Russia. During its history Estonia has been ruled at times by Sweden and by Russia. It became independent in 1918 after World War I, but after World War II it was ruled by the USSR. In March 1944 Tallinn was bombed by Soviet Air Force, killing 436 civilians and totally destroying 5073 buildings. Since 1991, Tallinn has been the capital of an independent Estonia. Today more than 400,000 people live in Tallinn, which is one third of the population of Estonia. It is a big sea port. Its food and textile industries are important. The town has many pretty, old buildings. ==Climate== The chart below shows the climate of Tallinn. |source 2 = Pogoda.ru.net (rainy and snowy days)}} == Gallery == Vistas panorámicas desde la iglesia de San Olaf, Tallinn, Estonia, 2012-08-05, DD 20.JPG|View of the Old City Vistas panorámicas desde la iglesia de San Olaf, Tallinn, Estonia, 2012-08-05, DD 06.JPG|Tower of Fat Margaret Vistas panorámicas desde Toompea, Tallinn, Estonia, 2012-08-05, DD 08.JPG|St Nicholas Palacio presidencial Kadriorg, Tallinn, Estonia, 2012-08-12, DD 24.JPG|Kadriorg Palace Iglesia Estonia Evangélica Luterana, Tallin, Estonia, 2012-08-05, DD 03.JPG|Lutheran church Catedral de Alejandro Nevsky, Tallin, Estonia, 2012-08-05, DD 27.JPG|Alexander Nevsky Cathedral Calle Kooli, Tallinn, Estonia, 2012-08-05, DD 04.JPG|Street in the Old City Columna de la Victoria de la Guerra de la Independencia, Tallinn, Estonia, 2012-08-05, DD 04.JPG|Victory column Pasaje de Santa Catarina, Tallinn, Estonia, 2012-08-05, DD 08.JPG|St Catherine passage Pikk Hermann, Tallin, Estonia, 2012-08-11, DD 16.JPG|Pikk Hermann Plaza de la Torre, Tallinn, Estonia, 2012-08-05, DD 13.JPG|City walls ==References== Category:World Heritage Sites in Europe Category:Tallinn
