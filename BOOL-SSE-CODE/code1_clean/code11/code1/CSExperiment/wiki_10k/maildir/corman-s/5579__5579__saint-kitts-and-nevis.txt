It is the smallest independent country in the Western Hemisphere. The capital city is Basseterre. It is on the main island of St Kitts, also called Saint Christopher. The island of Nevis has some rights of self-government and two seats in the federal parliament. St Kitts and Nevis is about one-third of the way from Puerto Rico to Trinidad and Tobago. The headquarters of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank is in St Kitts. That bank controls the East Caribbean dollar. ==History and Politics== The two islands were part of the Leeward Islands Colony from 1871 to 1956, and of the West Indies Federation from 1958 to 1962. The Islands, plus Anguilla, got limited self-government in 1967. Anguilla objected and the Metropolitan Police were sent there in 1968 to stop rioting. Until 19 December 1980 the official name of St Kitts and Nevis was Saint Christopher, Nevis and Anguilla.[http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Kitts/kitts83.html The Saint Christopher and Nevis Constitution Order 1983, S.I.1983:881 Section 2] St Kitts and Nevis became an independent Commonwealth realm in 1983, Anguilla has stayed a British Overseas Territories. In 1970, a movement to make Nevis separate from St Kitts started. In 1983, the constitution set up a 15-member National Assembly. The Assembly is unicameral, that is, it only has one chamber. 3 members of the Assembly are appointed by the Governor General, on the advice of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. The other members are elected. If the Speaker decides to stand for re-election he is automatically elected, without a contest. In 2023 Terrance Drew said that he planned a public consultation on whether St Kitts and Nevis should become a republic. === Nevis === Nevis is responsible for its own internal affairs. There is an eight-member Nevis Island Assembly, and an Island administration headed by the premier. ==Geography== The country has two main islands, Saint Kitts and Nevis. The highest peak, at 1,156 metres, is Mount Liamuiga. There is also a smaller island named Booby Island. No one lives on Booby Island. The islands are of volcanic origin. There are large central peaks covered in tropical rainforest. People do not live on the steeper slopes leading to these peaks. Most of the people on both islands live closer to the sea. There are many rivers coming from the mountains of both islands. These give fresh water to the people. St. Kitts also has one small lake. ==Parishes== The federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis is divided into fourteen parishes. There are nine divisions on Saint Kitts and five on Nevis. {| class="wikitable" !Name !Number ofpeople !Capital !Other villages and towns |- |Saint Thomas Lowland, Nevis |2,035 |Cotton Ground | * Westbury * Barnes Ghaut * Jessup * Stuart's |- |Saint John Figtree, Nevis |2,922 |Figtree, Saint Kitts and Nevis | * Bath, Saint Kitts and Nevis * Church Ground * Brown Hill * Brown's Pasture * Pembroke * Bush Hill * St. Peter's Hill * Cole Hill |- |Saint George Gingerland, Nevis |2,568 |Market Shop, Saint Kitts and Nevis | * Chicken Stone * Taylors Pasture * Zetlands * Hull Ground * Rawlins * Crook's Ground * Rices * Buck's Hill * Sheriffs * Holmes Hill * Fenton Hill * Stony Hill * Webb's Ground * Harris * Zion * New River |- |Saint Paul Charlestown, Nevis |1,820 |Charlestown, Saint Kitts and Nevis | * Craddocks |- |Saint James Windward, Nevis |1,836 |Newcastle, Saint Kitts and Nevis | * Rawlins * Fountain * Scarborough * Camps * Rick's * Brick Kiln * White Hall * Butler's * Burnaby * Mt.
