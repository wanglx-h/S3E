'''Spaghetti Westerns''' were a name given to low-budget Western (genre) movies, which were made by Italy movie companies in the late 1960s. They were different from the United States western movies, usually filmed in Italian, had limited budgets, filmed on location in Spain and Italy with minimal sets, and many close-ups and artistic shots. Perhaps the most well-known of these movies is "Dollars trilogy" trilogy: ''A Fistful of Dollars'' (1964), ''For a Few Dollars More'' (1965), and ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'' (1966). All three of these movies were directed by Sergio Leone, featured music by Ennio Morricone, and starred American actor Clint Eastwood as the main character. == Other websites == *[http://www.spaghetti-western.net Spaghetti Western Database] Category:Western (genre) movies
