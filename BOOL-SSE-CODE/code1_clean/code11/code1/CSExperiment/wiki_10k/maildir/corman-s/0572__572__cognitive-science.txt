'''Cognitive science''' studies how people make their idea and what makes thought logical. It is often seen as the result of several different scientific fields working together. These fields are psychology (a study of the mind), neuroscience (biological study of the brain), computer science (the creation of programs and computers), and linguistics (the study of language). It does not refer to the sum of all these disciplines. It refers to their intersection on specific problems. ==Other websites== * * [http://www.cognitivesciencesociety.org Cognitive Science Society] * [https://www.indiana.edu/~cogfilms Cognitive Science Movie Index: A broad list of movies showcasing themes in the Cognitive Sciences] * [http://carbon.ucdenver.edu/~mryder/itc/cogsci.html List of leading thinkers in cognitive science] * [http://www.carlstahmer.com/cogsci/index.php Dr. Carl Stahmer's history page at the University of Santa Barbara] Category:Interdisciplinary fields Category:Cognition
