File:ChartistRiot.jpg]] The '''Chartists''' were people who wanted to get more rights for working class people in the mid-19th century. They were called Chartists because they wrote their main aims down in the People's Charter of 1838. Chartism thus relied on constitutional methods to secure its aims, though some became involved in insurrectionary activities, notably in South Wales and in Yorkshire. == Other websites == * [http://www.chartists.net/The-six-points The-six-points from CHARTIST ANCESTORS] * [http://john-leech-archive.org.uk/keyword/chartist-movement.htm Punch Series on "Great Chartest Demonstrations"] * [http://www.bham.ac.uk/1848/document/april10.htm Illustrated London News, April 15th, 1848] * [http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/chartism.htm Spartacus index on Chartism] Category:19th century in the United Kingdom
