Subject: Asexual reproduction
'''Asexual reproduction''' is reproduction without sex. In this form of reproduction, a single organism or cell (biology) makes a copy of itself. The genes of the original and its copy are the same except for rare mutations. They are clones. The main process of asexual reproduction is mitosis. This type of reproduction is common among some Unicellular organism such as ''Amoeba''. Many plants also reproduce asexually such as by means of Runner (botany). The individual zooids in a particular coral or bryozoan are usually genetically identical. They are formed by asexual reproduction of the first individual to arrive in a place. One whole order (biology) of the rotifers, the bdelloid rotifers, has no sexual reproduction. Many types of living things have a double cycle. At one stage, they have sexual reproduction, and at another they simply multiply by splitting or producing eggs that develop without being fertilized (Aphid). All daughters of the honey bee develop from unfertilized eggs. Asexual reproduction is therefore common in many forms of life. == Types == === Binary fission === File:Major events in mitosis.svg Some organisms like bacteria reproduce using binary fission. They split into two, and one bacterium becomes two bacteria. That always leads to daughter cells, and the offspring is identical to the parent. === Budding === File:Bryophyllum daigremontianum nahaufnahme2.jpg Budding is similar to binary fission but is used by plants and some animals, which cannot simply split into two the way that bacteria can. In budding, a small part of a plant or animal breaks off, and while they are separated from their "mother", they start to grow until both the "parent" and the "offspring" are the same size and are capable of budding again. That may happen many more times. === Parthenogenesis === Parthenogenesis is found in both plants and animals. Eggs develop without fertilisation. Examples occur in water fleas, rotifers, aphids, stick insects, some ants, bees and parasitic wasps. Parthenogenesis is very rare for Vertebrate. === Vegetative propagation === Vegitative popogation is very common in some types of plants using rhizomes or stolons (such as strawberry). Other plants form bulbs or tubers (for example tulip bulbs and dahlia tubers). Some plants may form a clonal colony, where all the individuals are clones, which may cover a large area. === Spores === File:Chain of conidia of an Alternaria sp. fungus PHIL 3963 lores.jpg is by the formation of conidia, a type of spore. Here is a chain of four conidia of ''Alternaria'']] Fungi (such as mushrooms) produce spores, which may be asexual or sexual. The asexual spores have the Genetics material inside, which allows them to make a whole new organism identical to its parent. The spores are produced by mitosis. Different fungi make different kinds of asexual spores, conidia, oidia, and pycniospores. The shape and the colour of the spores can be helpful to identify the species. == Sexual vs asexual reproduction == {| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center; border;1px" { ! Type !!
