It was founded by Tughril Beg in 1037. The Seljuk Empire stretched from Anatolia and the Levant to Afghanistan. It was replaced by the Khwarezmian Empire in 1194. The Seljuk Empire united the eastern Islamic world, and fought against the Crusaders in the First Crusade and Second Crusade. The Seljuk Empire made several long lasting changes. These affected the region even after the empire was gone. Among them was making Farsi as the official language for history and events. They also shifted the center for the Arabic language culture from Baghdad to Cairo.Andre Wink, ''Al-Hind: The Making of the Indo-Islamic World'', Vol. 2, 16. ==References== ==Other websites== * * Category:Former monarchies of Asia Category:Former empires Category:History of Iran Category:Medieval Azerbaijan Category:Former countries in the Middle East Category:Royal dynasties Category:11th-century establishments in Asia Category:14th-century disestablishments in Asia Category:History of West Asia Category:Geography of West Asia Category:Empires in Central Asia Category:Empires in West Asia
