Subject: Dome
A '''dome''' is a building or roof that usually looks like the upper half of a sphere. As a roof feature, domes make many religion and government buildings stand out, because if someone is speaking to others inside or under a dome, the voice sounds louder. Also a dome makes it easier to identify an important building, for example a temple or a palace. A large stadium with a roof over the playing field is often called a "dome". One example of that usage is the Metrodome. File:Petersdom von Engelsburg gesehen.jpg|St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City, with a dome, seen from outside.
