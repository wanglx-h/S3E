Pumas are mainly tan-color, and can be up to 9 feet long, although average length is 6 – 8 feet. They can weigh from 29 kilograms to 90 kilograms. (The males are larger.) Most pumas live up to 21 years. Unlike the big cats in the genus ''Panthera'', the puma cannot roar. Instead, it can growl, hiss, screech, and purr. Most of the big cats can only purr while breathing out. Pumas are carnivores because they eat only meat. Pumas are apex predators. They prey on deer, elk, bighorn sheeps, guanacos, raccoons, squirrels, foxes, rabbits, and skunks. They can also prey on Mouse, beavers, coyotes, Bobcat, birds, porcupines, fish, and bear cubs. They will sometimes prey on livestock such as cattle, Domestic goat, Domestic sheep, and Pig. They hunt at night. Cougars can see better at night than people can. They can hear well too. Pumas stalk their prey, which means they walk slowly and quietly, they hide and then when close, they jump or run fast to catch their prey by surprise. They live and hunt alone. Female cougars take care of their babies until they are old enough to take care for themselves. Baby cougars are called cubs or kittens. Pumas live in the mountains and forests far from people. However, encounters with humans happen sometimes. 26 people have been killed by cougars in North America in the last 30 years. However, many more cougars have been killed by humans. Cougars used to be found all in eastern North America, but they were hunted to extinction there by the beginning of the 1900s. Also, recent sightings of cougars have been reported from Michigan, New Brunswick, southern Indiana, Kentucky, and Vermont. For now, the only confirmed, population of cougars east of the Mississippi River is in Florida, where a subspecies of the cougar lives. ==Related pages== * Jaguar * Lion * Leopard * Cheetah ==Sources== == Other websites == * [http://www.iucnredlist.org/search/details.php/18868/all IUCN] * [http://dspace.dial.pipex.com/agarman/puma.htm Information on Pumas] Category:Mammals of North America Category:Mammals of South America Category:Big cats
