| associated_acts = }} '''Muse''' or '''The Muse''' is an English people alternative rock power trio. They began in Teignmouth in 1994, consisting of Matthew Bellamy (guitar, piano, vocals), Chris Wolstenholme (bass and background vocals) and Dominic Howard (drums). They are sub-classified as mainly progressive rock, and play music with melody and fast tempo. However, they also play a great number of other styles of music, especially on their older albums like ''Showbiz''. Their albums, ''Black Holes and Revelations'', ''Absolution (album)'' and ''The Resistance'', have been successful in the United States, the United Kingdom and most western countries of the world. ==History== ===Creation and early EPs=== Matthew Bellamy, Chris Wolstenholme, and Dominic Howard grew up in a small town called Teignmouth in Devon. They were boredom there, so they started playing music together. When they were 13 years old, they made a band called Gothic Plague. The band was later called Fixed Penalty. After that, it was called Rocket Baby Dolls. In 1994, while they were called Rocket Baby Dolls, they won a Battle of the Bands competition. During this competition, they broke their Musical instruments, but still won.Stephanie Meyer, best selling author, used Muse's songs for inspiration(MAJOR inspiration). In 1997, they chose the name Muse. Muse's members did not like Teignmouth. In an interview in 1999, Bellamy said that it was full of people who took drugs, and that it was like a "living hell". Muse left Teignmouth and met Sawmills Studio owner, Dennis Smith. He liked their work and offered them a contract with his record label, Dangerous Records and put them in the studio with producer Paul Reeve. Muse released their first Extended play called ''Muse'' in 1997. The band went to more band competitions and won several. In 1998, they released their second EP, ''Muscle Museum''. The EP was popular, and Muse toured around Europe and Australia. ===''Showbiz''=== ''Museum'' was popular enough to get Muse a record contract with Maverick Records in the United States. The band started to work on a new album. They wrote new ones, though, for their next album. The other songs they used were already on their EPs. Muse worked with producers Paul Reeve and John Leckie, who produced Radiohead's album,''The Bends''. File:Muse logo.svg Muse's first album, ''Showbiz'', came out in 1999. In the United States, Maverick used a large advertising campaign to make Muse more popular. Muse were already popular in the UK, and ''NME'' said they were "the first great British guitar band of the 21st century". US magazine ''Rolling Stone'' said ''Showbiz'' sounded a lot like Radiohead. Matthew Bellamy did not like that comparison, but people would still compare Muse and Radiohead in the future. Other reviewers said the band had a lot of potential after listening to ''Showbiz''. ===''Origin of Symmetry''=== In the year 2000, Muse traveled a lot to help sell ''Showbiz''. The wikt:highlight#Noun of the tour was touring with Red Hot Chili Peppers and Foo Fighters. The band played at over 50 music festivals in Europe, and several in Japan. While they were traveling, the band recorded some songs for their next album. In January 2001, they started working on the rest with producer John Leckie, in Peter Gabriel's studio. Muse began touring again in May 2005, after finishing the album. They had not released it, but Bellamy told BBC he thought the best way to promote it was to play live music. The band's second album, ''Origin of Symmetry'', was released in June 2001 in the UK. However, it was only released in North America in 2005.Jaclyn Arndt (24 August 2005). The album did not do well on music chart, but was popular with critics. ''NME'' praised the album for the songs on it being very wikt:loud and angry. Allmusic said the album was very loud and sometimes wikt:ridiculous because of the Musical instruments and riffs used on it, but that it was still very good. Nescafé used the song "Feeling Good" from ''Origin of Symmetry'' (which was a cover song of a Nina Simone song) in an advertisement once. Muse lawsuit Nescafé because they did not agree with how the company did business. They received money from Nescafé after suing. They donated it to Oxfam. Muse almost sued Celine Dion when she tried to use the name Muse as the title of a performance in Las Vegas. ===''Absolution''=== Muse's third album was recorded in lots of studios in places like London and Los Angeles.
