Subject: Noble gas
The '''noble gases''' are a group of elements that are all gases. These elements are all in '''group 18''' of the periodic table. All of them are Monatomic, meaning each molecule is a single atom. They almost never react with other chemical element. This is because they have a full 8 electrons outer electron shell. There are six noble gases: * helium * neon * argon * krypton * xenon * radon All of these gases are found in air. They make up around 0.96% of the atmosphere. Noble gas compounds can be formed from noble gases. When the noble gases are used in cold cathode tubes to produce light, each of them has a different colour. Since Radon is radioactive, it is usually not used for lighting. Here are pictures of what the others look like: Image:HeTube.jpg|Helium Image:NeTube.jpg|Neon Image:ArTube.jpg|Argon Image:KrTube.jpg|Krypton Image:XeTube.jpg|Xenon Oganesson (element 118) is probably the next noble gas after Radon because it is the next box down in the same group. However it has a Half-life (element) of 0.89 ms, after which it decays to Livermorium (Element 116). This means its use is probably limited. Noble gases were discovered by John Strutt and Sir William Ramsay. Rayleigh won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1904 for his work on noble gas. Ramsay won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1904 for his work with noble gas. == References == Category:Noble gases
