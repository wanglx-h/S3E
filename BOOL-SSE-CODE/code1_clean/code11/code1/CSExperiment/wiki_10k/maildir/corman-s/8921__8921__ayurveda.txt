The ancient Indians knew how to take out kidney stones and how to do rhinoplasty (plastic surgery for the nose). Medicines are typically based on chemical compounds taken from plants, Mineral, and metal substances (perhaps because of the influence of early Indian alchemy or ''rasa shastra''). == Effectiveness == There is no good evidence that Ayurveda works or helps for any disease. Some Ayurvedic products are dangerous and contain Lead poisoning, Mercury poisoning, and arsenic. In 2008, nearly 21% of Ayurvedic products sold on the internet and made in India and the United States contained lead, mercury, and arsenic (heavy metals) in quantities that are toxic. There may be public health dangers that result from this, but that is not known. == References == === Cited references === * * (Republished by National Informatics Centre, Government of India.) * * * * * * Category:Indian culture Category:Ayurveda Category:Pseudoscience Category:Healthcare in India
