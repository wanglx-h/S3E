File:Great Lakes Lake Erie.png '''Lake Erie''' is one of the Great Lakes in North America. It is the second to the last in the Great Lake system before water flows into the St. Lawrence River. Like Lake Superior, Lake Huron, and Lake Ontario, Lake Erie is part of the boundary between the United States and Canada. In 1813 a naval battle was fought on the lake. Most of the water that flows into Lake Erie flows through a small river, the Detroit River, that moves water down from Lake St. Clair past Detroit, Michigan, Michigan. Some more water flows into Lake Erie from other rivers, including the Maumee and the Cuyahoga. At the foot of the Maumee is Toledo, Ohio, Ohio. At the bend of the Cuyahoga is Cleveland, Ohio, Ohio. Water that flows out of Lake Erie flows past Buffalo, New York, New York (state), and into the Niagara River. The river pours over Niagara Falls, one of the largest waterfalls in North America, and then into the lowest of all the Great Lakes, Lake Ontario.
