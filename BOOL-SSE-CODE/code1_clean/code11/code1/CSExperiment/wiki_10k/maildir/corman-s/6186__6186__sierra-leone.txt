Slave trade was becoming more popular, so the forts mostly traded humans. In fact, Bunce island became a popular place to transport slaves to Europe and Americas. ==Geography and climate== The country is bordered by Guinea to the north and northeast, Liberia to the south and southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. Mount Bintumani reaches . It is the highest point in the country. The climate is hot, tropical and humid all year round, with two seasons.

Nighttime temperatures do not vary a lot and may fluctuate by 2°C - 4°C. December and January are preferably the best times to visit Sierra Leone as temperatures and humidity are much lower and reasonable due to the hammattan breeze from the Sahara desert, although afternoon temperatures can still climb up to 40°C and above, the hammattan breeze stops it from getting too humid, even though it will still be hot, humidity would be can be lowered down to 39%, meaning you'll sweat less during this time than you would when the climate goes back to its original state, so therefore the heat would be more endurable especially around coastal areas. When the hammattan breeze has lowered the heat and the humidity to its base, the highest average daily temperature in December and January will only reach a maximum of 31°C (88°F) and nighttime temperatures will be 24°C (75°F), although it can sometimes drop to 21°C (70°F) at night, and sometimes in the morning which is the lowest the temperature can get. During this time, humidity is 70% & it is pleasantly warm and enjoyable. The rainy season from May-November, average temperatures are 27°C (81°F) - 29°C (84°F) with humidity 95% - 100%. Some days when it doesn't rain, temperatures can climb up to 32°C (90°F) and humidity can be moderate around 75%.
