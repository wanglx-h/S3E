The first, the Women's United Soccer Association (WUSA), was founded in 2001, but folded due to large debts after the 2003 season. The second, Women's Professional Soccer (WPS), was effectively a successor to WUSA, although it did not begin until 2009. Like WUSA before it, WPS played three seasons, but also lost large amounts of money; it first decided not to play its planned 2012 season, and then completely folded in May of that year. After WPS folded, the effective top level of women's soccer in the U.S. was Women's Premier Soccer League Elite, a "semi-pro" league that had both professional and amateur teams. WPSL Elite was created by the Women's Premier Soccer League, one of two second-division women's leagues, as an outlet for former WPS teams, as well as WPSL teams that wanted to play professionally. WPSL Elite played in 2012 with eight teams; six were professional, and three once played in WPS. The other second-division league was the W-League, part of the United Soccer Leagues. WPSL Elite was planned as a temporary league before a possible return of WPS. In late 2012, a totally new top-level league was created, known as the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL). It was run by U.S. Soccer until 2020, and started play in 2013 with eight teams, four of which had been members of WPS. The league added teams in 2014 and 2016 to become a 10-team league, making it the first professional women's league in the U.S. to have more than eight teams and last more than three seasons. The league dropped to 9 teams in 2017, but returned to 10 in 2021 and further expanded to 12 for 2022. ===Women's United Soccer Association=== Operated from 2001 to 2003. *Atlanta Beat *Boston Breakers *Carolina Courage *New York Power *Philadelphia Charge *San Diego Spirit *San Jose CyberRays *Washington Freedom ===Women's Professional Soccer=== Operated from 2009 to 2011. *Atlanta Beat (joined WPS in 2010) *Boston Breakers (now in the NWSL) *Chicago Red Stars (dropped to the WPSL after the 2010 season; later in WPSL Elite, and now in the NWSL) *FC Gold Pride (from the San Francisco Bay Area; folded after the 2010 season) *Los Angeles Sol (folded after the 2009 season) *magicJack (WPS) (formerly the Washington Freedom; played in South Florida) *Philadelphia Independence (joined WPS in 2010) *Saint Louis Athletica (folded during the 2010 season) *NJ/NY Gotham FC (from the New York City area; now in the NWSL as NJ/NY Gotham FC) *Washington Freedom (moved to South Florida after the 2010 season and renamed magicJack) *Western New York Flash (an offshoot of the WPSL's Buffalo Flash, and playing home games in Rochester, New York; joined WPS in 2011, later moved to WPSL Elite, still later to the NWSL; now a youth-only operation) ===WPSL Elite=== * ASA Chesapeake Charge (based in the Baltimore area) * Boston Breakers * Chicago Red Stars * FC Indiana (based in the Indianapolis area; plays throughout the state) * New England Mutiny (based in the Springfield, Massachusetts area) * New York Fury (based on Long Island) * Philadelphia Fever * Western New York Flash ===National Women's Soccer League=== Currently Operating * Angel City FC * Chicago Red Stars * Houston Dash * Kansas City Current * NJ/NY Gotham FC * North Carolina Courage * OL Reign * Orlando Pride * Portland Thorns FC * Racing Louisville FC * San Diego Wave FC * Washington Spirit ===W-League=== *Central Conference **Atlantic Division ***Atlanta Silverbacks ***Bradenton Athletics ***Carolina Dynamo ***Central Florida Krush ***Charlotte Lady Eagles ***Cocoa Expos ***Hampton Roads Piranhas ***Richmond Kickers Destiny **Midwest Division ***Chicago Gaels ***Cincinnati Ladyhawks ***Cleveland Internationals ***Fort Wayne Fever ***London Gryphons ***Michigan Hawks ***Minnesota Lightning ***West Michigan Firewomen *Eastern Conference **Northeast Division ***Boston Renegades ***Long Island Lady Riders ***New Hampshire Lady Phantoms ***New Jersey Wildcats ***New York Magic ***Northern Virginia Majestics ***South Jersey Banshees ***Western Mass Lady Pioneers **Northern Division ***Hamilton Avalanche ***Laval Comets ***Ottawa Fury ***Rochester Rhinos ***Sudbury Canadians ***Toronto Lady Lynx ***Vermont Lady Voltage *Western Conference **Fort Collins Force **Mile High Edge **Real Colorado Cougars **San Diego Gauchos **Seattle Sounders **Vancouver Whitecaps ==Professional indoor soccer== ''Indoor soccer'' is a form of soccer played inside a building, sometimes called an arena, instead of in a stadium on a grass field.
