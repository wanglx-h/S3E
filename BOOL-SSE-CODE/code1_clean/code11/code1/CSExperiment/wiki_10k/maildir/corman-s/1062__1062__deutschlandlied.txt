'''Deutschlandlied''' (; "The Song of the Germans"), officially known as '''Das Lied der Deutschen''' (; "Song of Germany"), is a song written by Joseph Haydn and Hoffmann von Fallersleben. Part of this song is the national anthem of Germany (Deutsche Nationalhymne). A line from this song, "Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit" ("Unity and :wikt:justice and Freedom") is the considered to be the unofficial :wikt:motto of Germany. ==History== The music was written by Haydn in 1797 as the personal anthem of Francis I of Austria. It was called "Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser" ("God protect our Emperor Francis I of Austria"). The words which are used today were written by the poet August Heinrich Hoffman von Fallersleben in 1841. Today, the first line "Germany, Germany above all" sounds too strong for some people, and is often misunderstood. Fallersleben wanted a united Germany when he wrote it. At that time, Germany was not one country, but many small country. So "Germany above all" meant that the most important thing to do was to have a unified Germany. Also, the poet was written in Heligoland, where people spoke German but were ruled by the Great Britain. Fallersleben's music was very popular in Germany during the second part of the 19th century. This song was not a national anthem then, but a patriotic song supporting a united German state. On 11 August 1922, after 4 years of the end of the First World War and the abdication of Wilhelm II, German Emperor, it replaced the previous anthem "Heil Dir im Siegerkranz" ("Hail Thee in the Victor's Crown"). In 1921, a "fourth stanza", a new part or verse, was written by poet Albert Matthai with words about the difficult life in Germany at that time. This verse was rarely used. During the time of Adolf Hitler, only the first stanza of the song was used. This offended the international audience as the first stanza supports Germany holding colonial powers in non-consenting nations. This was often followed by Horst-Wessel Lied, the anthem of the Nazi Party. After the Second World War, Germany was divided into two countries. In 1949, the new West Germany tried to get a new song for the national anthem. Another song was chosen, written by poet Rudolf Alexander Schröder. It was not very popular. Finally, on 2 May 1952, President Theodor Heuss approved the decision to make Das Lied der Deutschen the national anthem of Germany. However, only the third stanza was used. In the other part of Germany, known as German Democratic Republic, the words of poet Johannes R. Becher ("Auferstanden aus Ruinen" - "Risen from Ruins") were used with a song written by Hanns Eisler. It was not very popular, and from the 1970s the words were not sung, because of the line "Germany, [our] unified fatherland". After East and West Germany united in 1990, the song again became the national anthem of Germany but only the third stanza is used. Today, the first part of the song is popular with nationalist extremists. {| border="0" noborder |----- | ==German words of the song== | ==Close translation== |----- | col="2" | ===First stanza=== |----- | :'''D'''eutschland, Deutschland über alles, :über alles in der Welt, :wenn es stets zu Schutz und Trutze :brüderlich zusammenhält. :Von der Maas bis an die Memel, :von der Etsch bis an den Belt, :|: Deutschland, Deutschland über alles, :über alles in der Welt! :| | :'''G'''ermany, Germany above all, :above anything in the world, :when always for protection :we stand together as brothers. : from the Meuse (river) river (west of Germany) to the Nemen river (east of Poland), :from the Adige river (Italy) to the Belt (the sea near Denmark). :|: Germany, Germany above all, :above anything in the world. :| |----- | col="2" | ===Second stanza=== |----- | :'''D'''eutsche Frauen, deutsche Treue, :deutscher Wein und deutscher Sang :sollen in der Welt behalten :ihren alten schönen Klang, :uns zu edler Tat begeistern :unser ganzes Leben lang. - :|: Deutsche Frauen, deutsche Treue, :deutscher Wein und deutscher Sang! :| | :'''G'''erman women, German wikt:faith, :German wine and German songs :should continue to get approval :all over the world, :and help us to do great work :all our life. :|: German women, German faithfulness, :German wine and German songs! :| |----- | col="2" | ===Third stanza - the Deutsche Nationalhymne=== |----- | :'''E'''inigkeit und Recht und Freiheit :für das deutsche Vaterland! :Danach lasst uns alle streben :brüderlich mit Herz und Hand! :Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit :sind des Glückes Unterpfand; :|: blüh im Glanze dieses Glückes, :blühe, deutsches Vaterland. :| | :'''U'''nity and justice and liberty :for the German fatherland ; :After these let us all strive together, :as brothers, with heart and hands. :Unity and :wikt:justice and liberty :are the pledge for good fortune; :|: Flourish in the splendour of such fortune, :flourish, German fatherland. :| |----- |} __NOTOC__ ==Lyrics== {| class="wikitable" !
