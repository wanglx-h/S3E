}} |synonyms_ref = }} '''''Hibiscus syriacus''''' is one of the common flowering shrubs found in gardens, a species of ''Hibiscus''. Common names for the same plant include '''Rose of Sharon''' (but it is not a rose), '''rose mallow''', '''shrub-althaea''', '''Syrian hibiscus''', '''Syrian ketmia''', and '''St Joseph's rod'''. The part of the name "syriacus" seems to say that the origin of this plant is from Syria, but this is only because it was named after being discovered in gardens there. Historically it was endemic to ancient Korea and parts of China. Today the flowers are national symbols of Korea. In Japan, the flowers are often shown at Japanese tea ceremony for decoration. There are many variations of flowers in gardens, because gardeners of the past were able to find different colors and shapes of flowers, and grow their seeds. ==Gallery== File:Koreanroseofsharon.JPG|''Hibiscus syriacus'' is the national flower of South Korea.
