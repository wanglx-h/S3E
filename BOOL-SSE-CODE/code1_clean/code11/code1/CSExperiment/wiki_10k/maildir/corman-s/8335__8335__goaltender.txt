:''For the similar jobs in other sports, see Goalkeeper.'' Image:Patrick Roy 1999.jpg playing goaltender for the Colorado Avalanche]] The '''goaltender''' (also known colloquialism as '''goalie''', '''tendy''', or '''netminder''') in ice hockey is the player who defends his team's goal net by stopping shots of the hockey puck from entering his team's net, thus stopping the other team from score. They usually stay close to the net. At the very end of a game, if a team is losing by one goal, teams may take their goaltender out of the game and replace him with another player (not a goaltender). This makes it more likely that they will score a goal, however, it is also much easier for the other team to score without anybody defending the goal.[https://media.nhl.com/site/asset/public/ext/2024-25/2024-25Rules.pdf] Category:Ice hockey positions
