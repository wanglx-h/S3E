File:Thomas Paine rev1.jpg was a famous deist and wrote ''The Age of Reason.'']] '''Deism''' is the belief that a higher being (like God) exists but that the only revelation of God is in nature and reason, not in sacred books or prophets. Deism says that people should rely on logic and reason and not traditions of a religion based on a holy book. People who follow deism are called '''deists'''. Deists believe that a higher power created the world. They may not believe that the creation of the universe happened because of a spontaneous event. They usually reject supernatural events like miracle and believe that God has set up natural laws that govern how the universe works and how people should act that and God does not interfere with those laws. Most deists also see holy scriptures, such as the Bible and Qur'an, as writings by people, rather than by God. Famous deists from history include the United States political leader and inventor Benjamin Franklin, France Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, the French philosopher Voltaire, the Great Britain philosopher Thomas Paine, and the French revolutionary leader Maximilien de Robespierre. Many historians think that US President Thomas Jefferson was a deist though he failed to say so. == References == == Other websites == * [http://www.deism.com/ World Union of Deists] Category:Theology
