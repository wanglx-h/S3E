It is the area inside a square (geometry) that has each side equal to one statute mile (5,280 Foot_(unit_of_length) or 1,760 US yard). This way of talking about area is often used to say how much land there is on a farm, or in a city or country, for example. One square mile is just less than 2.59 square kilometres.
