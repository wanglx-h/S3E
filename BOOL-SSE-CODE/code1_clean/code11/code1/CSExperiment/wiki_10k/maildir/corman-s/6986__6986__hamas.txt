Retrieved 2025-01-29. ==Name== ''Hamas'' is an acronym of the Arabic language phrase , or '''Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiyya''' or "Islamic Resistance Movement". ==History== Hamas was started in 1987 by Ahmed Yassin and Abdel Aziz al-Rantissi after the beginning of the First Intifada against Israeli violence and occupation. It started as the Gaza Strip branch of the Muslim Brotherhood organization in Egypt. In the 2006 Palestinian legislative election, the party received 74 out of 132 seats in parliament by campaigning on clean government without corruption and affirming Palestinians' right to defend against Israeli occupation. ==Ideas== The party has supported the reestablishment of the Land of Palestine in all historic land, which includes the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and the State of Israel. The 2017 Hamas Charter stated that the party's struggle was with Zionists and Israeli terrorists. In 2018, the United Nations voted to reject an American claim to condemn Hamas. Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told the Reuters news agency, "Rejecting the American drafted resolution against the resistance represents a blow to the American administration and reaffirms the legitimacy of the resistance." ==Controversies== ===Violence=== Hamas is known for terrorist attacks on Jewish targets worldwide. Because of its history of Suicide bombing and rocket strikes on civilians in Israel, the United States, European Union and several countries call it a terrorism organisation. Particularly, Jordan has banned the group.

As per scholar Esther Webman, strongly antisemitic rhetoric is frequently found in Hamas Pamphlet, which tend to equate Jews with Zionism to incite terrorism against Jews.Webman, Esther. ''Anti-semitic Motifs in the Ideology of Hizballah and Hamas'', Project for the study of Anti-semitism, Tel Aviv University, 1994, p. 22. The Hamas' Charter frames the group's raison d'être as being "against the Jews [...] Israel, Jews and Judaism [are a] challenge to Islam and the Muslim" and makes it clear that The Hamas' Charter also blames the The Protocols of the Elders of Zion#Judeo-Masonic conspiracy theory, French Revolution, Russian Revolution, World War I and World War II on a "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion." In August 2003, senior Hamas official Doctor (title) Abd Al-Aziz Al-Rantisi wrote in the Hamas newspaper ''Al-Risala:'' In August 2009, Hamas forbade Palestinian children from studying the Holocaust, demonized by the Hamas as "a Holocaust denial."[http://jta.org/news/article/2009/08/31/1007549/hamas-condemns-un-for-teaching-the-holocaust#When:14:44:00Z "Hamas rips U.N. for teaching the Holocaust."] ''Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA)''. 31 August 2009. 31 August 2009. ==Election== In early 2006, Hamas won a clear victory in the vote for the 2006 Palestinian legislative election. Voters saw Hamas as an alternative to exchange the long-ruling Fatah party, the main part of the Palestine Liberation Organization. This was due to how Fatah had not improved the Palestinian people's conditions and instead allegedly worsened conditions by corruption. There have been no elections since 2006. ==Support== As of 2021, Qatar had given $1.8 billion in support to Hamas.https://www.dw.com/en/who-is-hamas/a-57537872 Iran provides up to $100 million per year to Palestinian terrorist groups, including Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command. ==Local work== Hamas has shown its organizational ability by building health, education, and social services to help the population in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, where there are many Poverty. Their efforts ended up increasing support to Hamas. In the first half of 2007, Hamas gained political control of the Gaza Strip, while Fatah keeps its headquarters in the West Bank. ==Notes== ==References== Category:Hamas Category:Gaza Strip Category:Nationalism Category:Islamic terrorism Category:Religious terrorism Category:Politics of Palestine Category:Sunni organizations Category:Arab–Israeli conflict Category:Gaza–Israel conflict Category:Nationalist terrorism Category:Political parties in Asia Category:Palestinian nationalism Category:Islamist militant groups Category:1987 establishments in Asia Category:Nationalist organizations in Palestine
