'''Canidae''', also known as a '''Dog Family''' is a family (biology) of carnivorous and omnivorous mammals of the Order (biology) Carnivora. Animals that belong to the Dog family Canidae are '''canids'''. The family Canidae is divided into two tribes: Vulpini (foxes), and Canini (wolf, dogs, coyotes, and jackals). The family Canidae also includes the genus Urocyon (gray foxes and island foxes) and two extinct groups of canids: Borophaginae and Hesperocyoninae. Canids that belong to Vulpini are "vulpines". Canids that belong to Canini are "canines". Canines are usually pack animals which hunt their prey in a group. Foxes usually hunt alone. However, almost all canids are social animals. Canids live on every continent on Earth, except for Antarctica. Many of them reached certain areas alongside humans. One kind of canid, the dog, became a Domestication. This made dogs the most well-known canids, and one of the most widely kept pets. == Taxonomy == * Tribe '''Vulpini''', foxes ** Genus ''Vulpes'' *** Indian fox, ''Vulpes bengalensis'' *** Blanford's fox, ''Vulpes cana'' *** Cape fox, ''Vulpes chama'' *** Corsac fox, ''Vulpes corsac'' *** Tibetan fox, ''Vulpes ferrilata'' *** Pale fox, ''Vulpes pallida'' *** Rüppell's fox, ''Vulpes rueppelli'' *** Swift fox, ''Vulpes velox'' *** Kit fox, ''Vulpes macrotis'' *** Red fox, ''Vulpes vulpes'' *** Fennec fox, ''Vulpes zerda'' ** Genus ''Alopex'' *** Arctic fox, ''Alopex lagopus'' ** Genus ''Urocyon'' *** Gray fox, ''Urocyon cinereoargenteus'' *** Island fox, ''Urocyon littoralis'' ** Genus ''Otocyon'' *** Bat-eared fox, ''Otocyon megalotis'' * Tribe '''Canini''', Dogs ** Genus ''Dusicyon'' *** Falkland Island fox, ''Dusicyon australis''extinction ** Genus ''Pseudalopex'' *** Culpeo, ''Lycalopex culpaeus'' *** South American grey fox, ''Lycalopex griseus'' *** Darwin's fox, ''Lycalopex fulvipes'' *** Pampas fox, ''Lycalopex gymnocercus'' *** Sechura fox, ''Lycalopex sechurae'' *** Hoary fox, ''Lycalopex vetulus'' ** Genus ''Atelocynus'' *** Short-eared dog, ''Atelocynus microtis'' ** Genus ''Cerdocyon'' *** Crab-eating fox, ''Cerdocyon thous'' ** Genus ''Speothos'' *** Bush dog, ''Speothos venaticus'' ** Genus ''Chrysocyon'' *** Maned wolf, ''Chrysocyon brachyurus'' ** Genus ''Nyctereutes'' *** Raccoon Dog (Tanuki), ''Nyctereutes procyonoides'' ** Genus ''Cuon'' *** Dhole, ''Cuon alpinus'' ** Genus ''Lycaon'' *** African wild dog, ''Lycaon pictus'' ** Genus ''Canis'' *** Grey wolf, ''Canis lupus'' **** domestic dogs, ''Canis lupus familiaris'' *** Red wolf, ''Canis rufus'' *** Coyote, ''Canis latrans'' *** Golden jackal, ''Canis aureus'' *** Black-backed jackal, ''Canis mesomelas'' *** Side-striped jackal, ''Canis adustus'' *** Ethiopian wolf, ''Canis simensis'' *** Eastern wolf, ''Canis lycaon'' == Gallery == Image:Coyote arizona.jpg|Coyote Image:FemaleYellowLabrador.jpg|Dog (Labrador Retriever) Image:Golden Jackal Revivim.jpg|Jackals Image:Marderhund.jpg|Raccoon dog (tanuki) Image:Vulpes_vulpes_laying_in_snow.jpg|Red Fox Image:Front view of a resting Canis lupus ssp.jpg|Wolf ==References== == Other websites == * [http://canids.org canids.org] Category:Canids
