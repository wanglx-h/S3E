It is similar to a veil, but more close-fitting. == Uses == There are different reasons why people use masks.Lommel, Andreas 1970. ''Masks: their meaning and function''. Ferndale Editions, London. A person can use a mask so others do not know who they are (as when committing a crime). Or, a mask may keep someones face safe from harm (like a gas mask so harmful gases do not get into the lungs). There are many practical uses for masks in everyday life. Mostly, the masks used are ''semi-masks'' which cover only the bottom half of the face, the mouth and nose. An example is the use of masks in operating theatres, and by wood-workers. In surgery, the purpose is to keep bacteria off the patient; in wood-working the purpose is to keep wood fibres out of the lungs. In Venice masks only the top half of the face is covered, to prevent recognition. Ice hockey masks, used in the Hannibal Lecter movies, cover the whole face to protect it from the hockey Puck (sports) moving at high speed. == Origin == === The word === The word 'mask' might have come from other languages. The French language ''masque'', the Italian language ''maschera'', the Spanish language ''máscara'', the Latin language (not classical) ''mascus/masca (meaning "ghost")'' or the Arabic language ''maskharah (meaning "jester" or "man in masquerade")'' all use the same word. === History === One of the oldest masks found is the Death Mask. This stone mask is 9000 years old and is probably the oldest mask in the world. It is kept in Musée de la bible et Terre Sainte, Paris. There are also three masks from the same period, kept in The Israel Museum, Jerusalem. Masks are used in many magical or shamanistic rituals in non-western societies.Chris Rainier and Meg Taylor 1996. ''Where the masks still dance: New Guinea''. Bulfinch Press/Little, Brown. The wikt:celebrate or wikt:appeasement of animism spirits takes place with dance and song in ancient performances in many parts of the world. In these events performers use costumes and masks to mimic the supposed spirits.John Emigh 1996. ''Masked performance''. University of Pennsylvania Press. From this kind of beginning, the use of masks in ancient Greek theatre may have started. The actors and Greek chorus in this early theatre all used masks. == Masks in recent times == Masks have been used to protect people against air-borne diseases. They were worn during the plague in the Middle Ages;This was not caused by an airborne virus, but by close association with rats. during the influenza epidemic of 1918, and the COVID-19 epidemic. Gas masks were issued in World War II even though phosgene gas was never used in that war (it had been in WWI). == Figurative uses == There are some other uses of the word 'mask', which arise by extension. That means using 'mask' as a metaphor. In Movie a mask is a screen which cuts out part of the image. In social theory, a mask is the behaviour a person takes on in his role or job. Thus policemen, head teachers, army commanders, prime ministers act as they are expected to act (most of the time). The Implication (grammar) is that behind the mask is the 'real' person. Their role is a mask. As a verb, 'to mask' means to cover or hide. == Related pages == *Veil *Theatre *Theatre of Ancient Greece * Surgical mask ** Abenomask == References == == Other websites == * [http://www.museedumasque.be/ International Mask and Carnival Museum] of Binche Category:Headgear Category:Non-verbal communication Category:Art Category:Metaphors
