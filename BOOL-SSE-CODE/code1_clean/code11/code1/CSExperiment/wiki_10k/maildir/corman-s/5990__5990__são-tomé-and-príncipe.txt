The main islands of São Tomé and Príncipe are about 140km apart and about 250 and 225km, respectively, off of the northwestern coast of Gabon. The country has a population of 201,800 (2018 official estimate),São Tomé and Príncipe is the second-smallest and second-least populous African sovereign state after Seychelles as well as the smallest and least populous Portuguese-speaking country in the world. The English translation of the countries name is '''Saint Thomas and Prince'''. The islands were a Portuguese colony, but have been independence since July 1975. Portuguese language is the official language. ==History== The Portuguese arrived in São Tomé Island on December 21, 1471, and Príncipe Island on January 17, 1492. As these were days dedicated to saints, both islands had saints’ names. S. Antão Island, the former name of Príncipe Island, changed in 1500 to honor the Prince of Portugal. The official historical version says that the country was uninhabited before the arrival of the Portuguese sailors. The first successful Portuguese settlement in the archipelago was in 1493. The volcanic soil of the islands proved to be good for sugar crops. Hard work was needed to grow and harvest the sugar crops. Slaves were brought from Portugal to do the work. Because other countries began producing more sugar, the islands were not able to make money from it. Instead it became a stopping place for the slave trade. In the 19th century, crops of coffee and cocoa were grown. These became successful. By 1908 the country was the largest producer of cocoa. It is the most important crop for the country. On February 3, 1953, the Batepá massacre occurred. In the massacre hundreds of local people were killed by Portuguese settlers. The Portuguese wanted workers for the crops. The locals said they were being used as slaves. The governor told the military to take any locals who did not want to work. In the late 1950s a group wanted independence. They were called the MLSTP (Movement for the Liberation of São Tomé and Príncipe/Social Democratic Party). In 1974 they succeeded in removing Marcelo Caetano as their leader. On 12 July 1975 São Tomé and Príncipe became an independent country. The first president was Manuel Pinto da Costa. He was the MLSTP`s General Secretary. Until 1990 the MLSTP was the only political party. They changed the constitution to allow other political parties. The new Democratic Convergence Party – Reflection Group (PCD) won the most seats in the National Assembly (São Tomé and Príncipe). Miguel Trovoada was elected president. ==Politics== The president is elected for a five-year term and can be re-elected. The prime minister is elected for a four-year term. The thirteen members of the cabinet (the group of ministers) are chosen by them. All adult citizens can vote in the elections. They vote by secret ballot. ==Provinces== São Tomé and Príncipe is divided into 2 provinces: Príncipe and São Tomé Island. The provinces are further divided into seven districts, six on São Tomé and one on Príncipe (with Príncipe having self-government since April 29, 1995). ===Cities=== {| class="wikitable" |- |colspan="6" align="center" | '''Cities in São Tomé und Príncipe''' |- |rowspan="2" align="center" | '''Rank''' || rowspan="2" align="center" | '''Place''' || colspan="3" align="center" | '''Population''' || rowspan="2" align="center" | '''District''' |----- |align="center" | '''Census 1991''' || align="center"| '''Census 2001''' || align="center" | '''Estimate 2005''' |----- |align=right | 1. || '''São Tomé''' (capital) || align=right | 42,331 || align=right | 49,957 || align=right | 56,166 || Água Grande |----- |align=right | 2. || Santo Amaro, São Tomé and Príncipe || align=right | 5,878 || align=right | - || align=right | 8,239 || Lobata District |----- |align=right | 3. || Neves, São Tomé and Príncipe || align=right | 5,919 || align=right | 6,635 || align=right | 7,392 || Lembá |----- |align=right | 4. || Santana, São Tomé and Príncipe || align=right | 6,190 || align=right | 6,228 || align=right | 6,969 || Cantagalo |----- |align=right | 5. || Trindade || align=right | - || align=right | 6,049 || align=right | 6,636 || Mé-Zóchi |----- |align=right | 6. || Santa Cruz, São Tomé and Príncipe || align=right | - || align=right | 1,862 || align=right | 2,045 || Caué |----- |align=right | 7. || Pantufo || align=right | - || align=right | 1,929 || align=right | 2,169 || Água Grande |----- |align=right | 8. || Guadalupe, São Tomé and Príncipe || align=right | - || align=right | 1,543 || align=right | 1,734 || Lobata District |----- |align=right | 9. || Santo António || align=right | 1,000 || align=right | 1,010 || align=right | 1,156 || Pagué |----- |align=right | 10. || Santa Catarina, São Tomé and Príncipe || align=right | - || align=right | - || align=right | 971 || Lembá |----- |align=right | 11. || Porto Alegre, São Tomé and Príncipe || align=right | - || align=right | - || align=right | 334 || Caué |} ==Geography and Climate== São Tomé and Príncipe is formed by two volcanic islands - the biggest of which is S.
