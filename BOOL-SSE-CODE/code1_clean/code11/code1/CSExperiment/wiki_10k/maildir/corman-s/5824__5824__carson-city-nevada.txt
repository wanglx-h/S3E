At the 2020 United States Census, Carson City had a population of 58,639. ==History== Settlers who lived present-day Carson City named the area "Washoe", after the Washoe people Native Americans who lived there. John C. Frémont and his party of wikt:explorer were the first European Americans to visit the Carson City area in 1843. Frémont named a river flowing through the valley Carson River for Kit Carson, who was a wikt:scout on Frémont's expedition. When Nevada became a state in 1864 during the American Civil War, Carson City was confirmed as Nevada's permanent capital. Abraham Curry, the founder of Carson City, reserved an area equivalent to four city blocks (10 acres or 4.04 ha) at the center of the town for the future state capitol building. When the Capitol building was built ten years later, it was located there. The fourth session of the state legislature met in the still-incomplete building at the beginning of 1871. Construction was completed by May 1, 1871. ==Transportation== Image:US395SouthofCarsonCity.jpg, just south of U.S. Route 50 near Carson City]] There are three major highways in the city US Route 395, U.S. Route 50 and Interstate 580.
