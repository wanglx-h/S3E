'''The Velvet Underground''' was an United States rock and roll band from New York City. It was formed in 1964. The original line-up was Lou Reed, John Cale, Sterling Morrison and Maureen Tucker. They were discovered by the famous artist Andy Warhol, who produced and designed the cover for their first album ''The Velvet Underground and Nico'', which paired them with another discovery of his: germany model and singer Nico. The album was never really a hit when it was released, but it is now considered a classic. Later, the group broke up with Warhol and Nico after being a part of Warhol's The Factory for a while. The group released several more albums, ''White Light/White Heat'' (1967), ''The Velvet Underground'' (1969) and ''Loaded'' (1970), before finally breaking up. Lou Reed later had a successful solo career and is considered one of the founders of the "punk" movement. The group got back together for a reunion tour in the 1990s. ==Discography== ;Studio albums * ''The Velvet Underground & Nico'' (1967) * ''White Light/White Heat'' (1968) * ''The Velvet Underground (album)'' (1969) * ''Loaded (The Velvet Underground album)'' (1970) * ''Squeeze'' (1973) * ''Scepter Studios Sessions'' (2012) ==References== Category:American rock bands Category:Musical groups from New York City
