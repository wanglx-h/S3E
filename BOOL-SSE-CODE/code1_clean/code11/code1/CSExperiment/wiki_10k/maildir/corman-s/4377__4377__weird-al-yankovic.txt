He has made parodies of songs such as "American Pie" (his ever popular "The Saga Begins"), "Ridin'" ("White and Nerdy"), "Bad (song)" ("Fat"), "Like a Virgin" ("Like a Surgeon") and "Gangster's Paradise" ("Amish Paradise").

He is the only child of Nick Louis Yankovic (June 4, 1917 – April 9, 2004) and Mary Elizabeth Yankovic (née Vivalda; February 7, 1923 – April 9, 2004). His father was born in Kansas City, Kansas, of Yugoslavian ancestry, and began living in California after serving during World War II; he believed "the key to success" was "doing for a living whatever makes you happy" and often reminded his son of this philosophy. Nick Yankovic married Mary Elizabeth Vivalda in 1949. Mary, who was of Italian and English descent, and had come to California from Kentucky, gave birth to Alfred ten years later. All of this can be shown in a biopic movie of his life "Weird: The Al Yankovic Story" made in 2022. ==References== Category:Actors from Los Angeles County, California Category:American movie actors Category:Singer-songwriters from California Category:Comedians from Los Angeles County, California Category:Singers from Los Angeles County, California Category:1959 births Category:Living people Category:Musicians from Downey, California Category:"Weird Al" Yankovic
