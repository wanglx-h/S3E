In the 1930s, he made some successful movies like ''The Man Who Knew Too Much'' (1934), ''The 39 Steps'' (1935), and ''The Lady Vanishes'' (1938). He then moved to the United States, to work in Hollywood. His first American movie was ''Rebecca (1940 movie)'' (1940), which won an Academy Award. Some of his best known movies from the 1940s are ''Spellbound'' (1945) and ''Notorious'' (1946), which were inspired by psychoanalysis. His first movie in color was the experimental ''Rope'' (1948). ''Strangers on a Train'' (1951) was based on a novel by Patricia Highsmith. In the 1950s, he made three popular movies with Grace Kelly: ''Dial M for Murder'' (1954), ''Rear Window'' (1954), and ''To Catch a Thief'' (1955). In 1956, he made a new version of ''The Man Who Knew Too Much'', starring James Stewart and Doris Day. He returned to black-and-white, briefly, with ''The Wrong Man'' (1957). Then came ''Vertigo'' (1958), which some consider his best suspense movie. It was followed by three more successful movies: ''North by Northwest'' (1959), ''Psycho'' (1960), and ''The Birds'' (1963). After that, he only made 5 more movies: ''Marnie'' (1964), ''Torn Curtain'' (1966), ''Topaz (1969 film)'' (1969), ''Frenzy'' (1972), and ''Family Plot'' (1976). In 1971, he became the very first winner of the BAFTA Academy Fellowship Award. This is an award for lifetime achievement. In 1945 Hitchcock made a documentary about the Holocaust. It will be shown on British television in 2015. Hitchcock appeared very quickly in small roles in most of his movies.
