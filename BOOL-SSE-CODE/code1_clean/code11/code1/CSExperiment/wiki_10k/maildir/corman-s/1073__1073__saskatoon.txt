Saskatoon is the largest city in Saskatchewan but is not the capital, which is Regina, Saskatchewan. The South Saskatchewan River flows through the centre of the city, and many people enjoy boating, biking, and walking in the area. The University of Saskatchewan is also in Saskatoon. The name ''Saskatoon'' [in Cree language: ''sâskwatôn'', "Saskatoon"] comes from the Cree inanimate noun ''misâskwatômina'' "saskatoon berries," which refers to the sweet violet-coloured berry that grows in the area. == Media == Radio stations include commercial stations '''CKOM-AM''' 650 kHz (''“650 CKOM”'' News/Talk), '''CFMC-FM''' 95.1 MHz (''“C95”'' Hot AC), '''CJDJ-FM''' 102.1 MHz (“''Rock 102”'' Active Rock), '''CJWW- AM''' 600kHz (''“Country 600”'' Country), '''CKBL-FM''' 92.9 MHz (''“92.9 The Bull”'' Country), '''CJMK-FM''' 98.3 MHz (“''98 Cool FM''” Classic Hits), '''CFWD-FM''' 96.3 MHz (“''96.3 Cruz FM''” - Mainstream Rock) ==References== Category:Saskatoon
