It is an alkane with one carbon atom. It is often found as the main part of natural gas. Methane is a greenhouse gas[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/29/us/politics/white-house-unveils-plans-to-to-cut-methane-emissions.html ''White House Unveils Plans to Cut Methane Emissions''] March 28, 2014 New York Times 23 times more effective than carbon dioxide. It is also less stable and slowly oxidates by oxygen to carbon dioxide and water. It is a gas at 25 degrees Celsius at standard atmosphere (a specific pressure). == Uses == Methane is used in gas taps in places such as kitchens, chemistry classrooms, laboratories and more, as it burns very easily because of its simple molecular structure. == Molecular structure == Methane's molecular structure is very simple. It is a single carbon atom surrounded by four hydrogen atoms. == Production == Methane can be made by many chemical ways, but usually is found in natural gas and is obtained by fractional distillation, after it has become liquid. == References == Category:Alkanes Category:Greenhouse gases
