Peter Handke is known for his extremely critical (and perhaps even absurd) plays. Perhaps his best-known play is called ''Publikumsbeschimpfung'' (translates roughly as ''insulting /offending the audience''). The play consists of actors insulting and offending the audience, and later congratulating them for the good performance. The play has been labelled as ''antitheater''. In 2019, Handke was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.[https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/2019/summary ]nobelprize.org ==Note== ==Other websites== *[http://www.wim-wenders.com/movies/movies_spec/wingsofdesire/wod-song-of-childhood.htm Peter Handke, ''Song of childhood''] * *[http://art-bin.com/art/ahandkee.html "A son's long good-bye"], ''Svenska Dagbladet'', Karl-Erik Tallmo, September 23, 1988 Category:1942 births Category:Living people Category:Austrian Nobel Prize winners Category:Austrian writers Category:European translators Category:People from Carinthia (state) Category:Nobel Prize in Literature winners
