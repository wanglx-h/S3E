His ideology was called ''Francoism'' () or Falangism. ==Life== === Civil war === He was a leader of a coup d'état against the Spanish Second Republic in 1936. After this uprising the Spanish Civil War started. Franco was supported by fascists, big businesses, the church, conservative people and Spanish nationalists. The Spanish Republic had a socialist government that wanted to make businesses and the church less powerful. The Republic also set up local parliaments in the regions of Spain. Nationalists thought this was wrong and would make Spain weak. Three of the leaders of the coup died. Franco led the Army of Africa, the best part of the Spanish Army. He became the only leader. === World War Two === Franco remained neutrality during World War II as Hitler did not accept his conditions for Spain to join the Axis powers. Franco wanted Gibraltar and part of French North Africa. He sold Tungsten to Germany and allowed a group of volunteer soldiers to join the German Army to fight the Russians between 1941 and 1943. They were called the ''División Azul'' (Blue Division) === Death === Franco died in Madrid on 20 November 1975, just after midnight of heart failure. Relatives, such as his daughter Carmen Franco, 1st Duchess of Franco, had asked doctors to remove his life support systems. After Franco's death, Juan Carlos I of Spain became king. ==References== Category:1892 births Category:1975 deaths Category:Former dictators Category:Galician people Category:People with Parkinson's disease Category:Spanish Civil War Category:Spanish generals Category:Spanish politicians Category:Fascists Category:Anti-communists Category:Anti-Masonry
