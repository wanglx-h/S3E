There was an leak at a chemical factory which released a lot of the toxic poison dioxin, ''TCDD'', into the air. The cloud of poison gas covered an area 6km long and 1km wide. It was named after the municipality of Seveso. It resulted in the highest known exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) in residential populations There were many studies and new regulations after the accident. The European Union directive covering the protection against such accidents is known as Seveso-II-directive today. The company where the accident happened was called Icmesa. It was owned by Givaudan, who is owned by Roche. Icmesa produced Trichlorophenol, which is used to produce the disinfectant Hexachlorophene. The company was located in four communes; one of them Seveso. None of the 20,000 people who lived in Seveso died, but the poison killed 3,000 farm animals and pets. Another 70,000 animals had to be killed to stop the dioxin from getting into the food chain. ==Long term problems== Thirty years after the accident, scientists reported that babies born in the area affected by the dioxin were six times more likely to have thyroid problems. The affected people, now in their forties, are being studied to see if it stopped them growing properly, or reduced intellectual development (IQ). ==References== Category:1976 in Europe Category:1970s crimes in Europe Category:1970s disasters in Europe Category:1970s in Italy Category:Disasters in Italy Category:1976 events Category:Province of Monza and Brianza Category:July events
