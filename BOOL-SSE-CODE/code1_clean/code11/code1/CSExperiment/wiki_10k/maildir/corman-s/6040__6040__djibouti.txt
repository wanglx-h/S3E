The capital city is also called Djibouti (city). Djibouti gained its independence from France on June 27, 1977. The country was created out of the French Somaliland (later called the France Territory of the Afars and Issas), which was created in the 1800s as a result of French colonialism in Africa. In 2020, about 920,000 people lived there. It is one of the least populous countries in Africa. Two ethnic groups, the Somalis and the Afar people, account for most of the people living in the country. Djibouti joined the United Nations on September 20, 1977. It is also a member of the Arab League, as well as the African Union and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD). ==History== The history of Djibouti goes back thousands of years when it was part of the Sabean Empire (Ethiopia) to a time when Djiboutians traded hides and skins for the perfumes and spices of ancient Egypt, Pakistan, and China. Through close contacts with the Arabian peninsula for more than 1,000 years, the Somali and Afar tribes in this region became among the first on the African continent to accept Islam. Djibouti is a Muslim country which regularly takes part in Islamic as well as Arab meetings. The country is close to a narrow part of the Red Sea so it is considered an important area from a military viewpoint. == Djiboutians == 921,000-935,000 | langs = Somali language, Afar language, Arabic language, French language | rels = Islam (100%; Sunni IslamSufism), | related_groups = Ethiopians, Eritreans, Djiboutians, Somalians (Somalis of Somalia), Horn of Africa }}The '''Djiboutians''' () are the people inhabiting or originating from Djibouti (including their diaspora). The country is mainly composed of two ethnic groups, the Somalis and the Afar people. It has many languages - though Somali language and Afar language are the most widely spoken ones, Arabic language and French language serve as the official languages. There is a small Djiboutian diaspora in North America, Europe, and Australia. ==Geography== Djibouti is near to the Horn of Africa. It is bordered by Eritrea in the north, Ethiopia in the west and south, and Awdal of Somalia in the southeast. The remainder of the border is formed by the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden at the east. In the Great Rift Valley the rift between the African Plate and the Somali Plate meet the Arabian Plate. This makes a geologic tripoint that is the lowest place in Africa. Djibouti has eight mountain ranges with peaks of over 1,000m (3,281ft). The Mousa Ali range is the country's highest mountain range. The Grand Bara desert covers parts of southern Djibouti. Most species of wildlife are found in the northern part of the country, in the ecosystem of the Day Forest National Park. This forest area is the main habitat of the endangered and endemic Djibouti francolin (a bird). == Administrative divisions == File:The Regions of Djibouti.png Djibouti is divided into six administrative regions, with Djibouti (city) representing one of the official regions. It is further subdivided into twenty Districts of Djibouti. {| class="wikitable sortable" |+ Regions of Djibouti |- ! Region ! Area (km2) ! Population (2010) !
