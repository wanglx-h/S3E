Most Rastafarians live in the Caribbean, most notably Jamaica. Rastafarians say that Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia is Jah (shortened from Jehovah). They say that Jesus has returned again in the form of Jah, as he promised in the Bible, and he will deliver them to Zion (their name for paradise or Ethiopia). Rastafarians do not drink alcohol, they do not cut their hair, they spirituality smoke Cannabis, and they have a strict all-natural (often Vegetarianism) diet. The diet is called ''I-tal'' (derived from the word ''vital)'', and is something like Jewish kosher, but sometimes with no meat at all. Dreadlocks are a common Rastafarian hairstyle. For them, dreadlocks are an expression of spirituality: the term "dread" refers to a "fear of the Lord". Naturality is an important part of the Rastafari way of life. They want to return to Africa and live naturally. They believe that smoking marijuana helps them to get in touch with Jah, and their way of life is improved when they practice meditation. ==Rastafari movement in culture== Many reggae musicians are part of the Rastafari movement, including the famous musician Bob Marley, who died in 1981. Rapper Snoop Dogg became a Rastafarian in 2012.
