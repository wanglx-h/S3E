Subject: Songwriter
A '''songwriter''' is a writer who creates songs. A songwriter generally writes songs for popular music, rather than art songs or classical music. Many songwriters are also singers, and perform the songs they write - they are called singer-songwriters. Other songwriters have their songs performed by other singers. ==History== The history of writing songs is thousands of years old. Scholars believe that men and women may have created and sung songs even at the time of prehistory. Many modern bands have one or two members who write songs for the band. Others have more members contribute songs, or give the whole band credit for writing. Others perform songs by outside writers. ==Famous songwriters== *Lennon–McCartney, members of The Beatles *Brian Wilson and Mike Love, members of The Beach Boys *Justin Bieber *Paul Anka *Burt Bacharach *Bob Dylan *Stephen Foster *Woody Guthrie *Johnny Mercer *Willie Nelson *Mickey Newbury *Harry Nilsson *Laura Nyro *Dolly Parton *Cole Porter *Glen Ballard *Diane Warren *Neil Young *:en:John_Williams ==Related pages== * Composer Category:Music industry Category:Songwriters Category:Entertainment occupations
