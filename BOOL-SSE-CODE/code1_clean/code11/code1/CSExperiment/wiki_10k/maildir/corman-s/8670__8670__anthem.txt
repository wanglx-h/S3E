Unlike motet, anthems were sung in England and often accompanied by an Organ (music). Over time, the word “anthem” has come to mean “a song of celebration”. Most countries today have National anthem. == History == As early as 1502, the composer Fayrfax was paid 20 British pound for composing an anthem. After King Henry VIII founded (started) the Anglican church in the 1530s, church composers were told to write music in English. Most anthems used words from the Bible. Many anthems were composed after the Reformation. At first they were like motets, but in English. Soon the English anthem developed differently from the continental motet. Two kinds of anthems developed. One was the “Full Anthem,” in which the whole anthem was sung by the full choir. The other was the “Verse Anthem,” which was usually longer and had several Verse (poetry) which would be sung by Solo (music), with Choir (music) for the full choir in between. === National anthems === ''Main article: National anthem'' Most countries today have national anthems. Well-known examples include O Canada; the The Star-Spangled Banner (United States); God Save the King (United Kingdom); La Marseillaise (France); Jana Gana Mana (India); March of the Volunteers (China); and Lupang Hinirang (Philippines).
