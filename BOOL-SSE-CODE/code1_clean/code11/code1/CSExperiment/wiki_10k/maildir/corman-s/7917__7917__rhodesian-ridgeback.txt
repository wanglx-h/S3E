It has a red-brown coat (dog) of fur on its body and a line of hair down its back which is different from the rest of hair on its body. They are sometimes called ''The African Lion Dog'', because they were used by hunters in Africa to find and confuse lions while the hunter shot the lion. ==References== == Other websites == * [http://www.expert-dog-training.com/indexR.php Rhodesian Ridgeback and other dog breeds] * [http://rhodesian-ridgeback.startpagina.nl Rhodesian Ridgeback Startpage].
