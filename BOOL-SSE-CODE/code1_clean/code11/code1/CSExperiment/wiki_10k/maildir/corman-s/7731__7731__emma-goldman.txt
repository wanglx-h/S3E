She was also known for being one of the first women’s reproductive rights activists. In addition, Goldman wrote many books. Her most famous book, “Living My Life,” is an autobiography. ===Activism=== Goldman was born in a part of the Russian Empire, which is now known as Lithuania. She moved to the United States with her family when she was 17. She was upset by the way workers and labor activists were treated in the US. In 1889, she moved to New York City. In New York, she joined an anarchist group. In the anarchist group, she met a new friend and someone she would work with for a long time, Alexander Berkman. In 1892, they attempted to assassinate (kill) Henry Clay Frick, for the way he treated workers. Berkman was unsuccessful and spent fourteen years in prison, but Goldman was not punished. Later, in 1901, William McKinley was assassinated by an anarchist who said he was inspired by Goldman. Goldman defended the murderer by saying “if the people want to do away with assassins, they must do away with the conditions which produce murderers." Besides being a defiant radical, Emma was very well known for being incredibly influential in women’s reproductive rights activism. She fought for women’s sexual and economic freedom. Goldman was a nurse and midwife and taught other women about birth control. She was imprisoned in 1916 for this because at the time spreading information about birth control was illegal. ===Troubles=== Goldman faced many legal troubles. In 1893, she was convicted of starting a riot and spent a year in prison. She was arrested in 1901 for allegedly conspiring in the assassination of William McKinley, but was never found guilty. In 1917 she was arrested and spent two years in prison for not supporting World War I. ===Back to Russia=== In 1919, Goldman and Berkman were sent back to Russia because the American government thought they were too dangerous. The Russian Revolution had just happened and Goldman was hopeful that Russia might end up being a good place. She ended up deciding that the revolution in Russia was not as good as she thought and that the Bolsheviks tricked many of the people in Russia. She thought the Bolsheviks were too controlling and were too powerful. She also did not like that the Soviet Union put lots of anarchists in jail for not agreeing with them. ===Moving to Europe=== She and Berkman left after two years and Goldman lived in many places in Europe, including England and France. In 1936 she moved to Spain to help the anarchists fight the fascism during the Spanish Civil War. ===Death=== She death in Toronto of a stroke. She is buried near Chicago, Illinois. ==References== Category:1869 births Category:1940 deaths Category:American anarchists Category:American atheists Category:American autobiographers Category:American communists Category:American essayists Category:American feminists Category:American philosophers Category:American political activists Category:American prisoners Category:Deaths from stroke Category:Jewish American scientists Category:Jewish American writers Category:Jewish activists Category:Jewish atheists Category:Jewish feminists Category:Jewish philosophers Category:American LGBT rights activists Category:Lithuanian Jews Category:Naturalized citizens of the United States Category:People from Kaunas Category:Russian Jews Category:Soviet Jews Category:Writers from New York City
