'''Fryderyk Franciszek Chopin''' (1 March 1810 – 17 October 1849; pronounced SHOH-pen) was a Poland composer and virtuoso pianist. He is considered one of the greatest Romantic music piano composers. Chopin was born in Żelazowa Wola, a village in the Duchy of Warsaw. A famous child prodigy, he grew up in Warsaw where he completed his music education and composed many of his mature works before leaving Poland in 1830 at age 20, shortly before the November Uprising. == Early life == After the Uprising, he lived in Paris as part of Poland's Great Emigration. During the last 19 years of his life, Chopin performed only about 30 times, usually in a Salon (gathering). He supported himself by selling his composition (music)s and teaching piano. After a romantic relationship with Polish women, including an abortion, from 1837 to 1847 he carried on a relationship with the French writer Amandine Dupin, better known as George Sand. == Works == Since he composed many piano pieces, he was called the poet of the piano. Most of Chopin's List of compositions by Frédéric Chopin are for solo piano, though he also wrote two piano concertos, a few chamber music and some Polish songs (Chopin) to Polish lyrics. His piano works are often technically difficult, especially because deep expression is involved along with the importance of considering each detail in his music. Chopin also created the ballade (classical music)#Instrumental ballades, along with the addition of new ideas to the piano sonata, mazurka, waltz, nocturne, polonaise, étude, impromptu, scherzo and prelude (music). All of Chopin's works involve the piano, and for composing them he was using a number of them. While living in Warsaw, Chopin played on a Fryderyk Buchholtz piano.Vogel, “Fortepiany i idiofony klawiszowe w Królestwie Polskim w latach młodości Chopina,” 64. Later in Paris he preferred an instrument from Pleyel et Cie.[https://archive.org/details/chopinsletters00chop/page/158/mode/2up?q=non+plus+ultra Chopin's letters.
