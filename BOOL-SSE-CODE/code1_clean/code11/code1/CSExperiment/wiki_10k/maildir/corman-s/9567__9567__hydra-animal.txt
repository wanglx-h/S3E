Subject: Hydra (animal)
'''''Hydra''''' are simple invertebrates, with two layers of body Cell. They live in fresh water. Their body is radially symmetry. They have a central cavity through which they take in food and expel waste. As Cnidaria, they have cnida on their tentacles. They are hydrozoa, and belong to the same order as other polyps. Most ''Hydra'' are microscope in size. Hydras can be found in almost any unpolluted body of water. Hydras reproduce by budding. In budding, the offspring forms as a lump on the parent and eventually becomes big enough to break off and live by itself. They can move if they need to by a kind of slow somersaulting motion. Recent research has found they produce an anti microbe protein ''hydramacin'', which protects their outer layer from bacterial infection.Jung S. ''et al'' 2009.

If cut they can regenerate half their body in 2 to 3 days. == References == Category:Cnidarians
