It is the Earth lowest surface, located 420 Metre (1,380 Foot (unit)) below sea level. The sea is drying up as Basin (geology) countries use water from its Tributary for drinking water and processes like irrigation. The Dead Sea is almost nine times as Salt water as the ocean because a lot of water evaporates out of it, leaving salt behind.

However, some microbes have adapted to the high salinity and are able to survive in the Dead Sea's harsh environment. Because the water is so salty, it weighs more than fresh water. This allows people to float in the Dead Sea without any effort. Tourism come from around the world to float in the water. ==Gallery== DeadSea3667.jpg|A rough Dead Sea, with salt deposits on cliffs Dead sea newspaper.jpg|Reading a newspaper while floating in the Dead Sea STS028-96-65.jpg | View of salt evaporation pans on the Dead Sea, taken in 1989 from the Space Shuttle Columbia (STS-28).
