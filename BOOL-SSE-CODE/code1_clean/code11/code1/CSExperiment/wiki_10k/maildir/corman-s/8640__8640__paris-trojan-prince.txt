File:Paris MET DP108445.jpg '''Paris''' is a personality in Greek mythology.Fagles, Robert, translator of Homer's Iliad. Penguin Books. ISBN 0-14-027536-3 He is an important person in the Trojan War, and Homer ''Iliad''. Paris was the son of King Priam of Troy and his wife Hecuba. Because it was prophesied that he would bring the end and destruction of Troy, he was left to die in the wilderness, but was found by another man, who took him as a son and named him Paris. Three goddesses, Hera, Aphrodite, and Athena, had a beauty contest with a prize of the golden Apple of Discord of Eris (goddess). Paris was the judge and they all bribed him. Hera offered him power, Athena offered him wisdom, and Aphrodite promised him the most beautiful woman in the world, Helen. The problem was that Helen was already married to Menelaus, the brother of Agamemnon. Paris took Helen home with him to Troy. This caused the Trojan War. During the war, Paris killed Achilles by shooting his heel with a poisoned arrow. Late in the war, Paris was killed by Philoctetes. == References == Category:People in Greek mythology
