File:Catedral1 Rodrigo Marfan.jpg, the capital city of Brazil, is a planned city]] A '''new town''', '''planned community''', or '''planned city''' is a kind of city that is designed by architects and engineerings before it is built. Most cities and towns just develop over the years, without a clear plan, and urban planning is used only for later expansion. Planned communities are designed with separate districts of the city for parks, Shop, houses, and offices. Many planned communities have a transportation system for commuters. There are many examples of Capital city being planned throughout history like Baghdad, Iraq; Washington, D.C., United States; New Delhi, India; Canberra, Australia; Brasília, Brazil; and Naypyidaw, Myanmar. == Pictures == File:Miletos stadsplan 400.jpg|The idea of planning a city is not new.
