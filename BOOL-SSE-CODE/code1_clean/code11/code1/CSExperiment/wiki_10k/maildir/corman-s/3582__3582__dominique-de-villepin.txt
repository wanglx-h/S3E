He was made Premier by Jacques Chirac after the French President removed Jean-Pierre Raffarin from the premiership. Raffarin failed to gain the support of the French people for the European Constitution. Dominique de Villepin said that his government's most important task would be job creation. He knew that the French people were concerned about the condition of the French economy. This was one of the reasons they had voted against the European Constitution in the referendum on 29 May 2005. On 15 May 2007, the last full day of President Jacques Chirac's term, Villepin gave his resignation from the office of Prime Minister and it was accepted by the President. He was replaced two days later by François Fillon. ==References== Category:1953 births Category:Living people Category:Alumni of the Institut d'études politiques de Paris Category:French diplomats Category:French lawyers Category:Government ministers of France Category:Prime ministers of France Category:People from Rabat
