He is now the majority owner of Major League Soccer team Inter Miami CF and the minority owner of EFL League Two club Salford City F.C.. In June 2003, Queen Elizabeth II gave David Beckham an Order of the British Empire. In January 2005, David Beckham became a UNICEF ambassador. When he moved from Manchester United F.C. to Real Madrid C.F. in 2003, he became the highest paid footballer in the world (this has long since been surpassed). == Early Life == David Robert Joseph Beckham was born at Whipps Cross University Hospital in London, England on 2 May 1975. He is the son of Ted and Sandra Georgina West."David Beckham." (2009). Notable Sports Figures. Detroit: Gale Publishing. p. 113. He grew up in the Manchester football youth system along with Ryan Giggs, Nicky Butt, Phil Neville, Gary Neville, and Paul Scholes who all turned out to be famous footballers. Beckham’s maternal grandfather was Jewish, and he describes himself as "Who is a Jew?", and wrote in his autobiography "I've probably had more contact with Judaism than with any other religion". == Career == === Manchester United === From 1992 through 2003, he played for Manchester United F.C. in the Premier League. === Real Madrid === After leaving Manchester United F.C., he signed a four-year contract with Real Madrid C.F. which ended in June 2007. === LA Galaxy === From 2007 to 2012, he played for LA Galaxy in the United States. He was loaned out to AC Milan of Italy for the 2008 - 2009 and the 2009 - 2010 seasons before joining the Galaxy again. === PSG === He played for Paris Saint-Germain F.C. in Ligue 1 until the end of the 2012/13 season. After the season ended, he retired. === England === He played for England national football team for 13 years, from 1996 until 2009. He was dropped from the England team after giving up his England captaincy but regained his place in the England squad when Fabio Capello became the England manager in 2008. == Personal life == David Beckham's wife is singer Victoria Beckham. Some people call her Posh Spice because she was a member of the Spice Girls. The couple have three sons: Brooklyn Joseph Beckham (born 4 March 1999 in London), Romeo Beckham (born 1 September 2002 in London), and Cruz David Beckham (born 20 February 2005 in Madrid, Spain), and a daughter Harper Beckham (born 2 July 2011).
