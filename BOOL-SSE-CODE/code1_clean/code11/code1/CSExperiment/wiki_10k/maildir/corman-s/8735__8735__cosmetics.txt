Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on Human factors in computing systems. ACM, 2007 The makeup market originated and developed in the United States during the 1910s, thanks to the pioneering efforts of influential figures such as Elizabeth Arden, Helena Rubinstein, and Max Factor. These visionary individuals played a crucial role in shaping the cosmetics industry. Shortly before the outbreak of World War II, Revlon entered the scene, followed by Estée Lauder in the post-war period, further solidifying the market's growth and diversity. Elizabeth Arden, Helena Rubinstein, Max Factor, Revlon, and Estée Lauder were instrumental in introducing innovative beauty products and revolutionizing the way makeup was perceived and used.
