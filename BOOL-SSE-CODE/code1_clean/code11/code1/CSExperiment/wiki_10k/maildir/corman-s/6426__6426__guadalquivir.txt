The name derives from the Arab ''Wadi al-Kabir'' ("big river"), whereas the Romans called it ''Betis''.

It goes through the provinces of Jaen province, Córdoba Province (Spain), Seville province and Cadiz province. The river is long. The main Tributary are the rivers Genil (which flows through Granada), The Minor Guadiana, Guadalbullon, and Guadajoz on the left side, and Guadalmena, Jandula, and Guadiato on the right. It is the only river in Spain with shipping traffic. At present, it only is navigable up to Seville. In the Roman epoch it was navigable up to Córdoba, Andalusia. Category:Rivers of Spain
