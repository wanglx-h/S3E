Subject: NAND gate
A '''NAND gate''' is a logic gate used to build digital logic circuits. It is a combination of an AND gate and NOT gate. The name refers to this. The NAND gate is a “universal gate”, that means all other types of logic gates can be obtained by wiring exclusively one or more NAND gates in a particular manner. == Behavior == Given two inputs, A and B, A NAND B will be true if at most one of A and B is true. In other words, A NAND B is false if both A and B are true, and true otherwise. {| class="wikitable" style="margin: auto" |- bgcolor="#ddeeff" align="center" |colspan=2|'''INPUT''' || '''OUTPUT''' |- style="background:#ddeeff; text-align:center" | A || B || A ⊼ B |- style="background:#ddffdd; text-align:center" | 0 || 0 || 1 |- style="background:#ddffdd; text-align:center" | 0 || 1 || 1 |- style="background:#ddffdd; text-align:center" | 1 || 0 || 1 |- style="background:#ddffdd; text-align:center" | 1 || 1 || 0 |} == Symbols == There are three symbols for drawing NAND gates in electrical circuit schematics: the "distinctive shape" symbol, the “military” symbol, and the “rectangular” symbol. For more information see logic gate#Symbols.

For example: * the negation can be represented by ¬A ≡ A ⊼ A * and the disjunction can be obtained by A ∨ B ≡ (A ⊼ A) ⊼ (B ⊼ B) Category:Logic gates
