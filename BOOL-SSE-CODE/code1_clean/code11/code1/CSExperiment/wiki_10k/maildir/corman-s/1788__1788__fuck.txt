'''Fuck''' is a common English language Profanity. It can be used either as an expression or to mean the act of sexual intercourse. However, the word ''fucking'' is used as an intensifier before a word (e.g. "I ''fucking'' hate this game"). It is commonly used to express anger and frustration (e.g. when something is not going in favor of someone), however it is a word that is offensive to most people. ==Related pages== *Bitch *Bullshit *Cunt *Shit Category:English profanity
