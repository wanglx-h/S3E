There are more than 3,500 persons who work for OSCE. Most of the persons who work for OSCE work at different places, and only about 10% of them work at its headquarters. Since the end of the Second World War, many countries of the Europe wanted to have an organization to discuss various matters, especially security. Such discussion had continued since 1950s. Many years after, in November 1972, leaders of 35 countries met in Helsinki. In 1973, these countries set up the '''Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe''' (CSCE). By the end of 1990s, communist governments in many countries had changed. In this situation, the role of CSCE was also changing. The leaders from member countries of CSCE met in Paris. On 21st November 1990, they signed an agreement. This changed the name of Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) to Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). This international organization continues to function. ==Related pages== * Council of Europe * European Union * International organization == Other websites == * [http://www.osce.org/ OSCE] official website Category:International organizations Category:Political organizations based in Europe Category:1973 establishments in Europe Category:Politics of Europe
