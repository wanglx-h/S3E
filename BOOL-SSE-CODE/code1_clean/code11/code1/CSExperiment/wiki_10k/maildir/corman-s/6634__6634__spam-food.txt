File:Logo SPAM.svg File:Sliced Spam.JPG File:Spam 2.jpg '''Spam''' is a canned food meat food made by the Hormel Foods. It is made from pork shoulder meat and ham. There have been many ideas about what the word "Spam" actually means. The Hormel Foods Corporation said the meaning of the name "is known by only some people". In some dictionaries "Spam" means "'''sp'''iced h'''am'''", "'''s'''houlder of "'''p'''ork '''a'''nd ha'''m'''" and Specially Produced American Meat Spam was used a lot in World War II, as there wasn't proper meat. Because of that, spam was used as a Rations item. == Jokes about Spam == *The British comedy group Monty Python created a short sketch about :en:Spam (Monty Python) in 1970. In it, a lady who does not like Spam is talking to a waitress in a restaurant when a bunch of Vikings cut their conversation by singing the word "Spam" over and over again. The lady does not like what is happening and eventually the word "spamming" became widely used to mean unwanted email messages. *Weird Al Yankovic made a parody song called :en:Spam (song). It was first recorded in 1988. == References == ==Other websites== * – United States * [https://web.archive.org/web/20170213164423/http://gogd.tjs-labs.com/gallery-view?product=spam Collection of mid-twentieth century advertising featuring Spam] from The TJS Labs Gallery of Graphic Design.
