The official position of the US government, as seen in the U.S. News & World Report, associated Lumumba's ideas of African socialist democracy as an African brand of communism. Thus, the Americans had plans to kill him.The Congo Story: From Lumumba to Mzee Kabila. By Alfred N. Mutua, Editorial, The Nation (Nairobi), 22 April 2001 He was murdered by the Katangans on January 17, 1961, just months after independence.
