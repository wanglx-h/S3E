'''Leet''' (sometimes written as "1337" or "l33t"), also known as '''eleet''' or '''leet-speak''', is another alphabet for the English language that is used mostly on the internet. It uses various combinations of ASCII characters to replace Latin alphabet letters. For example, leet spellings of the word ''leet'' include ''1337'' and ''l33t''; ''eleet'' may be spelled ''31337'' or ''3l33t''. It is used on the internet in Internet forum, chat rooms and online games. Leet is mostly used for English language, but can also be used with other languages including French language, Spanish language and German language. == Leet-speak == Leet-speak is a mixture of words (mostly computer-related jargon) spelled incorrectly intentionally*, usually coming from typo (Exempli gratia ''the'' becomes ''t3h''). The words of Leet-speak are usually put together to create a dialect (small language). This dialect is used in some places for funniness. l33tspeak uses numbers, ASCII symbols, and diacritics together to make symbols that look like Latin letters. For example, the name "David" would translate in 1337 as |)/-\\/1|) or more commonly as D4v1d. ==Examples== Most of the time it is only the Vowel that are changed and then usually only they are replaced by numbers. Therefore, it is unusual to see someone use the leet alphabet to spell out a whole word (although there are common exceptions, namely ''1337''). These are only examples; these are not mandatory for Leet-speak, which is not officially defined anywhere, like most Slang. * A: ∆,4, /-\, /_\, @, /\, Д, а * B: 8, |3, 13, |}, |:, |8, 18, 6, |B, |8, lo, |o, j3, ß, в, ь * C: * E: 3, &, ''£, ₤, €, е,'' * F: 7, |=, ph, |#, |", ƒ, * G: 6, 9, [, -, [+, C- * H: #, 4, |-|, [-], {-}, }-{, }{, |=|, [=], {=}, /-/, (-), )-(, :-:, I+I, н * I: 1, |, !, 9 * J: √,_|, _/, _7, 9, _), _], _}, ♪ * K: |, Ø, oh, Θ, о, ө * P: |o, |O, |>, |*, |°, |D, /o, []D, |7, р, ?, ¶, ₱ * Q: O_, 9, (,), 0, kw, Ω * R: |2, 12, .-, |^, l2, Я, ® * S: 5, $, § * T: 7, +, 7`, '|', `|`, ~|~, -|-, '][', т, † * U: |_|, \_\, /_/, \_/, (_), [_], {_}, μ * V: \/, √,✓ * W: \/\/, (/\), \^/, |/\|, \X/, \\', '//, VV, \_|_/, \\//\\//, Ш, 2u, \V/ * X: ×,%, *, >_, (/) === Letters for numbers === *'''0''' = O or space * '''1''' = I or L or 7 or | or ! * '''2''' = Z * '''3''' = E or e or m or w or ω or ∈ or ε or ∩∩ * '''4''' = h or A or y * '''5''' = S * '''6''' = b or G * '''7''' = T or K * '''8''' = B or X * '''9''' = g or J or P *'''10''' = I and O or L and O or | and O *11 = N or || *12 = R *0 = C or O or D or Θ or o ٢٤٨١ for: real ٩٥٨٦ for: goat ١٤٥ for: leo ٤٩٥ for: ego ٤٧٨ for: eva ٤٧٤ for: eve ٤٢٤ for: eye ٨٩٤ for: age ٩٤١ for: gel ٤٧٢٥ for: euro ٤٧٤٢ for: ever ٤٧١١ for: evil ٩٥٨١ for: goal ٤٧٥١٧٤ for: evolve ١٥٥٦ for: loot ٨٤٢٥ for: aero ٦١٤٢ for: tier ٧١٧٥ for: vivo ٢٥٢٨١ for: total ٧١٦٨١ for: vital ٢٤٩٨١ for: regal ٧١٦٨١ for: Vital ٩٨٦٨٢ for: Qatar === Intentional misspelling* === When people write in leet, they spell some words wrong all the time.

When they write in leet they try to write it in a special way, so that it is very different from English. "l33t is teh suck!" (meaning: 'leet sucks') shows that in leet people can use their own rules, and not use the English rules. A lot of times adjectives (describing words) are turned into nouns. The leet word "teh" (the) is also often placed in front of verbs, as in "I teh pwnd j00" (meaning I the owned you, meaning: I beat you badly). another example might be I 4m t3h pwnage!!!!11!!11 (meaning I am the best!) Leet speakers may also speak normally but without the vowels. Fr xmpl nmbr 1 u cn tll it wrks.= For example, number one you can tell it works. === Pronunciation === Because some words are too long for use in games they have been written how they sound. Here's a quick guide: * pwn --- own, pawn or powne * x or xx (as in haxxorz or haxorz) --- an x followed by a z. In this example, hackzorz would be pronunciation * R0fz --- rolling on floor screaming, pronounced rawfs ===Variations=== There are some that are uber 1337...using nothing but symbols and numbers to represent their letters... Example as follows; 1 4/\/\ 7|-|3 |*Much of the intentional misspelling said to be part of 1337 is actually more properly part of Internet_slang, a completely different thing. == References == Category:Internet slang Category:Alphabets Category:Encodings
