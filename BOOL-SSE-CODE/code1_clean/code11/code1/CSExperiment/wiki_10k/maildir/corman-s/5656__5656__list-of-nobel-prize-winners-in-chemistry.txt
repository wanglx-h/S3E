Subject: List of Nobel Prize winners in Chemistry
The '''Nobel Prize in Chemistry''' is awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. It awards people who have made progress in the scientific area of chemistry, those who have worked hard to learn more and have succeeded. The Prize is given every year. It is just one of many Nobel Prizes. A famous winner of this prize was Marie Curie. She won the prize in 1911 after she discovered radium with her husband Pierre Curie. She was the first person to win the prize twice; the first time was for Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903. ==List of winners == === 1901 1909 === * 1901 - Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff for work on chemical dynamics and osmotic pressure in solutions. * 1902 - Hermann Emil Fischer for work on sugar and purine syntheses. * 1903 - Svante Arrhenius for his electrolytic theory of dissociation. * 1904 - Sir William Ramsay for discovering inert gases in the air. * 1905 - Adolf von Baeyer for work on organic dyes and hydroaromatic compounds. * 1906 - Henri Moissan for the discovery of fluorine and the Moissan electric furnace * 1907 - Eduard Buchner his discovery of cell-free fermentation * 1908 - Ernest Rutherford for his work on radioactive substances * 1909 - Wilhelm Ostwald for his work on catalysis, chemical equilibria and rates of reaction. === 1910 1919 === * 1910 - Otto Wallach for his work on alicyclic compounds. * 1911 - Marie Curie for her discovery of radium and polonium. * 1912 - Victor Grignard for his discovery of the Grignard reagent. * 1912 - Paul Sabatier for his method of hydrogenating organic compounds. * 1913 - Alfred Werner for his work on atoms and molecules. * 1914 - Theodore Richards for his work on finding the atomic weight of chemical elements. * 1915 - Richard Willstätter for his work on chlorophyll. * 1916 - 1917 - No Award * 1918 - Fritz Haber for synthesis of ammonia from its elements. * 1919 - ''No award'' === 1920 1929 === * 1920 - Walther Nernst for his work on thermochemistry. * 1921 - Frederick Soddy for his work on radioactive substances and isotopes. * 1922 - Francis Aston for his discovery of isotopes and the mass spectrograph. * 1923 - Fritz Pregl for discovering the way to do micro-analysis of organic substances. * 1924 - ''No award'' * 1925 - Richard Zsigmondy for discovering a basic method in colloid chemistry. * 1926 - Theodor Svedberg for his work on disperse systems. * 1927 - Heinrich Wieland for his work on bile acids. * 1928 - Adolf Windaus for his work on sterols and vitamins. * 1929 - Arthur Harden and Hans von Euler-Chelpin for their work on fermentation sugar and fermentative enzymes. === 1930 1939 === * 1930 - Hans Fischer * 1931 - Carl Bosch, Friedrich Bergius * 1932 - Irving Langmuir * 1933 - ''No award'' * 1934 - Harold C.
