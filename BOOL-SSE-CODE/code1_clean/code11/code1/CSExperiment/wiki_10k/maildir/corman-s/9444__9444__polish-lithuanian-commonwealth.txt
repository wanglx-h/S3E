The Commonwealth was an extension of the Polish-Lithuanian Union, a personal union between those two states that had existed from 1386. It was one of the largestNorman Davies, ''Europe: A History'', Pimlico 1997, p. 554: ''Poland-Lithuania was another country which experienced its 'Golden Age' during the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. The realm of the last Jagiellons was absolutely the largest state in Europe'' countries in Europe in the 16th and the 17th centuries and had one of the largest populations. The Commonwealth covered more than the present lands of Poland and Lithuania since it also had all of present-day Belarus, a large part of present-day Ukraine and Latvia, and the western part of present-day Russia. The Commonwealth had high levels of ethnic diversity and Religious toleration.Halina Stephan, ''Living in Translation: Polish Writers in America'', Rodopi, 2003, , [https://books.google.com/books?id=y6DiiTcheBsC&dq=%22Polish-Lithuanian+Commonwealth%22+%22religious+tolerance%22&pg=PA373 Google Print p373] However, the amount of religious freedom varied over time.Feliks Gross, ''Citizenship and Ethnicity: The Growth and Development of a Democratic Multiethnic Institution'', Greenwood Press, 1999, , [https://books.google.com/books?id=I6wM4X9UQ8QC&dq=Polish-Lithuanian+Commonwealth+religious+tolerance&pg=PA122 Google Print, p122 (notes)] After several decades of prosperity,"In the mid-1500s, united Poland was the largest state in Europe and perhaps the continent’s most powerful nation".

The Commonwealth ended with the final Partitions of Poland in 1795. Its growing weakness had led to it being invasion and divided by its more powerful neighbours: Austrian Empire, Kingdom of Prussia and Russian Empire. ==Some information== *In Poland, the official languages were Polish language and Latin. In Lithuania, the official languages were Old Belarusian language, Latin, and Lithuanian language. *The Commonwealth was one of largest countries of its time. It had a large population and at one time covered about 400,000 square miles. Its population was around 11 million. People of different ethnicities lived in the Commonwealth. *For about 200 years, the Commonwealth fought wars with other powers of Europe of that time: Grand Duchy of Moscow Russians, the Ottoman Empire, and the Swedish Empire. *The Commonwealth developed a system of laws and legislature that reduced the power of the monarch. Some concepts of democracy also developed in the Commonwealth like constitutional monarchy. *In theory, the two countries of the Commonwealth were equal, but Poland had a leading role. *The Commonwealth had a major influence of the Catholic Church. However, the government allowed people to practice different religions and so there were many religions in the Commonwealth. *The Commonwealth also produced a national constitution, which was the first in Europe. *Agriculture was the main economic activity in the Commonwealth. ==References== '''Notes''' Category:Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth Category:1560s establishments Category:1790s disestablishments in Europe Category:1795 disestablishments Category:Former countries in Europe Category:Former republics
