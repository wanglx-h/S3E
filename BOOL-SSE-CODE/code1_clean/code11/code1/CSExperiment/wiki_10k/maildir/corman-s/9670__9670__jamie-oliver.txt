''The Sun.''] Some thought the students should have a healthy option available, but still be allowed to choose what they wanted to eat. In a four-part documentary TV series Oliver ran the kitchen meals in Kidbrooke School, Greenwich, for a year. He was disgusted by the unhealthy food being served to schoolchildren, and the lack of healthy alternatives on offer. His campaign to improve the standard of Britain’s school meals eventually persuaded the British Government to spend £280m on school dinners.The Ups and Downs of Jamie Oliver, a Celebrity Chef.
