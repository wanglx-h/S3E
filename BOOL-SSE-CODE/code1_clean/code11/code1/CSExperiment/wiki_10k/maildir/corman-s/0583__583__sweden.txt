The currency remains the Swedish krona (Swedish crown). == History == Sweden has been a kingdom for a thousand years. In the 15th century, during the Kalmar Union, Sweden had the same king as Denmark and Norway. In the early 16th century Sweden got a new king, Gustav Vasa. During the 17th century Sweden was a great power. Sweden had taken Estonia, Latvia, and Finland and parts of Norway, Germany, and Russia. In the 18th century Sweden became weaker and lost these places. In the early 19th century, Sweden's king died without an heir and the Swedish parliament voted for Jean Baptiste Bernadotte as the new king. Bernadotte fought Denmark and made them allow Norway to enter a Union of Sweden and Norway. This was Sweden's last war, and Sweden has not been at war for 200 years. In 1905, the Swedish-Norwegian personal union was dissolved. In many wars, including World War I and the Cold War, the country did not take sides. During World War II, it traded with both the British and the Germans in order to protect its neutrality. == Region == Sweden has 25 historical provinces (''landskap'').
