(2021 Canadian census) '''''' of the total Canadian population |languages = |religions = |related = Native Americans in the United States, Alaska Natives, Métis in Canada }} '''First Nations''' () are the people of Native American who have lived in the lands that are now part of Canada before Europeans came there. Many use the term because the people lived there long before Canada and to make it clearer that the they have many cultures, which are sometimes very different from others. Some consider the tem as respect to those who first cultivated certain patches of land. The aboriginal people from Canada's Arctic are thought of as a different group of people and are called the Inuit. The First Nations are important in the world because their stories have taught much about cultural values and how to live in harmony with the land. Other words that have been used for First Nations people, tribes, and cultures have been "indigenous", "aboriginals", "Indians", "Native Indians", "Amerinds," or "Natives." Most people now consider "Indian" to be people from India. ==References== --> }} Category:First Nations
