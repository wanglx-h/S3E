It shares its borders with the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the north, Tanzania to the north-east, Malawi to the east, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Botswana, and Namibia to the south, and Angola to the west. It used to be called Northern Rhodesia and it is currently named after the Zambezi River. Zambia is home to one of the seven natural wonders of the world, Victoria Falls. Zambia has at least 72 spoken languages. The capital of Zambia is Lusaka, which is also the largest city in the country. Hakainde Hichilema is the current president. Its :wikt:motto is ''One Zambia, One Nation'' and its national anthem is ''Stand and Sing of Zambia, Proud and Free''. Its official language is English language. == History == Zambia originated from Northern Rhodesia. In 1964 Zambia became an independent country. The first president was Kenneth Kaunda, who ruled Zambia for 27 years. Zambia was a One-party state. His United National Independence Party was the only legal party and all other parties were banned. After protests, democratic elections were held in 1991. Kenneth Kaunda lost the elections and gave away his power in an orderly manner to his successor Frederick Chiluba, a former union leader. Zambia is now a Multi-party system. It has had four democratic elections since 1991. The latest presidential election was in 2021, which was won by Hakainde Hichilema against Edgar Lungu. == Economy == In 1969, Zambia was making a lot of money because of the copper deposits that were mined in Copperbelt province. When copper became cheaper in the 1970s, the economy got worse because people in Zambia were not making as much money from selling copper. Today, Zambia is a poor country. It does not have many industries. Copper is still its main export. Commercial farming in Zambia is starting to make more money. == Provinces == File:Zambia provinces named.png Zambia is divided into ten provinces. Each province is divided into several districts. There are 117 districts all together. The provinces are: * Central Province, Zambia * Copperbelt Province * Eastern Province, Zambia * Luapula Province * Lusaka Province * Muchinga Province * Northern Province, Zambia * North-Western Province, Zambia * Southern Province, Zambia * Western Province, Zambia ===Cities=== The important places in Zambia are: {| class="wikitable" |----- |colspan="8" align="center" bgcolor="#FFA500" | '''Cities in Zambia''' |----- |rowspan="2" align="center" bgcolor="#98FB98" | '''Rank''' || rowspan="2" align="center" bgcolor="#98FB98" | '''City''' || colspan="4" align="center" bgcolor="#98FB98" | '''Population''' || rowspan="2" align="center" bgcolor="#98FB98" | '''Provinces of Zambia''' || rowspan="2" align="center" bgcolor="#98FB98" | '''Image''' |----- |align="center" bgcolor="#98FB98" | '''Census 1980''' || align="center" bgcolor="#98FB98" | '''Census 1990''' || align="center" bgcolor="#98FB98" | '''Census 2000''' || align="center" bgcolor="#98FB98" | '''Est. 2007''' |----- |align=right | 1. || Lusaka || align=right | 735,830 || align=right | 1,069,353 || align=right | 1,684,703 || align=right | 2,146,522 || Lusaka Province || File:Lusaka.jpg |----- |align=right | 2. || Ndola || align=right | 297,490 || align=right | 367,228 || align=right | 397,757 || align=right | 467,529 || Copperbelt Province || File:Ndola01.jpg |----- |align=right | 3. || Kitwe || align=right | 283,962 || align=right | 288,602 || align=right | 363,734 || align=right | 409,865 || Copperbelt Province || File:Kitwe.jpg |----- |align=right | 4. || Kabwe || align=right | 127,422 || align=right | 154,318 || align=right | 176,758 || align=right | 193,100 || Central Province, Zambia || File:Big Tree Natl Mont Kabwe.JPG |----- |align=right | 5. || Chingola || align=right | 130,872 || align=right | 142,383 || align=right | 147,448 || align=right | 148,469 || Copperbelt Province || |----- |align=right | 6. || Mufulira || align=right | 138,824 || align=right | 123,936 || align=right | 122,336 || align=right | 119,291 || Copperbelt Province || |----- |align=right | 7. || Livingstone, Zambia || align=right | 61,296 || align=right | 76,875 || align=right | 97,488 || align=right | 113,849 || Southern Province, Zambia || File:Livingstone2.jpg |----- |align=right | 8. || Luanshya || align=right | 113,422 || align=right | 118,143 || align=right | 115,579 || align=right | 112,029 || Copperbelt Province || File:Luanshya1.jpg |----- |align=right | 9. || Kasama, Zambia || align=right | 36,269 || align=right | 47,653 || align=right | 74,243 || align=right | 98,613 || Northern Province, Zambia || |----- |align=right | 10. || Chipata || align=right | 33,627 || align=right | 52,213 || align=right | 73,110 || align=right | 91,416 || Eastern Province, Zambia || File:Chipata - roadside clothes vendors.JPG |----- |} ==Related pages== * List of rivers of Zambia * Zambia at the Olympics * Zambia national football team ==References== '''Notes''' Category:Zambia Category:Least developed countries Category:1964 establishments in Africa Category:Commonwealth member states Category:English-speaking countries
