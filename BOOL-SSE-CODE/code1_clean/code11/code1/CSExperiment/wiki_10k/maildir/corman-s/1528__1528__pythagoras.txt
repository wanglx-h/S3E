He is best known for the proof of an important Pythagorean theorem, This is about right angle triangles. He started a group of followers called the Pythagoreans, who lived like monks. == Life and travels == Pythagoras was born in Samos, a little island off the western coast of Asia Minor. Pythagoras traveled to many places, including Miletus, Ancient Egypt, Babylon, and South Italy. Southern Italy was where he founded the Pythagorean school, in the town of Crotone == Impact == Pythagoras had a great impact on mathematics and theory of music. His theories are still used in mathematics today. Since he worked very closely with his group, the Pythagoreans, it is sometimes hard to tell his works from those of his followers. Religion was important to the Pythagoreans. They believed the soul is immortal and goes through a cycle of rebirths until it becomes pure. == His beliefs == Pythagoras' most important beliefs were that: #At its deepest level, reality is mathematical in nature, #Philosophy can be used for spiritual purification, #The soul can rise to union with the divine, #Certain symbols have a mystical significance, and #All brothers and sisters of the order should observe strict loyalty and secrecy. == Pythagorean theorem == File:Pythagorean Theoram.jpg Pythagoras is most famous for his theorem about right triangles. He said that the length of the longest side of the right angled triangle (called the hypotenuse) squared would equal the sum of the other two sides squared: a² + b² = c². There are many different proofs for this Pythagorean theorem. In the pythagoras theorem c is the hypotenuse and a&b are the legs of the right triangle. == Sources == * * Cerqueiro, Daniel. “Evohé (Doxografía de Pitágoras)”. Buenos Aires 2004: Ed. Peq. Ven.
