The '''violet''' is a genus of flowering plants. The common blue violet (''Viola sororia'') is the state flower of the U.S. state of Illinois. There is also a famous poetry that refers to violets. It goes "Rose are red, violets are blue", and then the poet adds his or her own lines to it. It is also February's birth flower. Some ''Viola'' species are perennial plants, some are annual plants, and a few are small shrubs. Many species, varieties and cultivars are grown in gardens for their flowers. In horticulture, the term '''pansy''' is used for the multi-coloured cultivars often used in bedding by professional gardeners. The terms 'viola' and 'violet' are normally used for small-flowered annuals or perennials, and the wild species. Category:Flowers category:Violets
