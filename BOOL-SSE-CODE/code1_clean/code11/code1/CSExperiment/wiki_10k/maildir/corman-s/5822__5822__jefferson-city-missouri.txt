It is also county seat of Cole County, Missouri. (The Jefferson City metropolitan area includes Callaway County, Missouri, Cole County, Missouri, Moniteau County, Missouri, and Osage County, Missouri counties.) As of the 2020 United States Census, the population was 43,228. Jefferson City was named after Thomas Jefferson, the third president of the United States. Jefferson City is near the center of Missouri, a region known as Mid-Missouri. It is on the northern edge of the Ozark Plateau on the southern side of the Missouri River. It is at the western edge of the Missouri Rhineland, one of the major wine-producing regions of the Midwest. ==History== In pre-Columbian times, this region was home of an ancient people known only as the Mound builders. By the time European settlers began arriving, the Mound Builders had vanished into history. The contemporary indigenous peoples were called the Osage Nation. When the Missouri Territory was organized in 1812, St. Louis, Missouri was the seat of government. St. Charles, Missouri next served as the capital. The new state legislature decided to build a new capital city in the middle of the state in 1821. They named it after Thomas Jefferson, who was still alive. A village was already there called Lohman's Landing.McMillen, Margot Ford & Murphy, Dennis. ''A to Z: The Dictionary of Missouri Place Names''. Columbia, MO. Pebble Publishing, 1996. . For years the village was little more than a trading post located in the wilderness about midway between St. Louis and Kansas City, Missouri. In 1826 the Missouri legislature first met here and in 1839 the settlement was incorporated as a city. Jefferson City was selected as the site for a state prison and, in 1836, the Missouri State Penitentiary was opened. The prison was home to a number of infamous Americans, including: former heavyweight champion Sonny Liston, assassin James Earl Ray, and bank robber Charles "Pretty Boy" Floyd. File:Missouri State Penitentiary, Jefferson City.jpg During the American Civil War, Jefferson City was occupied by Union (American Civil War) troops. Many of the people in the state supported the Union, although Missouri's Little Dixie (Missouri) section along the river in western counties was strongly Confederate States of America. German immigrants created vineyards in small towns on either side of the Missouri River, especially on the north from Jefferson City east to Marthasville, Missouri outside St. Louis. This area is known as the Missouri Rhineland after the Rhineland in Germany. It has grown as an agricultural and tourist economy. ==Geography== Jefferson City is located at (38.572954, -92.189283). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of . Of that, is land and (3.61%) is water. ==Education== Jefferson City is served by the Jefferson City Public School District, which operates Jefferson City High School and Capital City High School, Lewis and Clark Middle School and Thomas Jefferson Middle School, and eleven elementary schools. There are 4 private elementary schools: St. Joseph's Cathedral, St. Peter, Immaculate Conception, and Trinity Lutheran.

Jefferson City is one of four state capitols in United States that are not served by an interstate highway.Pierre, South Dakota; Dover, Delaware; and Juneau, Alaska are the other four state capitals without interstate highways.
