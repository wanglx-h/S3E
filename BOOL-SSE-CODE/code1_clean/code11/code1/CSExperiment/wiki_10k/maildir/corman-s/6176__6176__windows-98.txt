Released on June 25, 1998 by Microsoft, it is the successor of Windows 95. It came before Windows Me. Support for Windows 98 ended on July 11, 2006. Windows 98 was seen by many as a small upgrade to Windows 95, rather than a rebuilt version of Windows. The biggest changes were: * Internet Explorer (a web browser) was made part of the graphical user interface (what the user sees) and the file manager. This had already happened in the last versions of Windows 95 that were released. This is called 'web integration'. *Larger Disk partitioning (separations) were allowed. *New tools were added to help make the computer run the way a user wants it to. System Configuration Utility is a tool that lets users turn off programs they do not need to use the computer. Disk Cleanup let users delete old files the computer made. *Some add-ons that were made for Windows 95 were included with Windows 98, such as the changes to the Shell (computing) from Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95. Because Microsoft made Internet Explorer such an important part of Windows 98, the company was taken to court by the United States government. This was because they felt it was unfair to other companies who made web browsers. It is not supported anymore, but many people still use it on older computers that will not run Windows XP or later versions of Windows. ==Press demonstration== Before the release of Windows 98, there was a press demonstration at Comdex in April 1998. Microsoft CEO Bill Gates was highlighting the operating system's ease of use and enhanced support for Plug and play (PnP). When presentation assistant Chris Capossela plugged a Image scanner in and attempted to install it, Windows 98 displayed a Blue Screen of Death. Gates remarked after applause and cheering from the audience, "That must be why we're not shipping Windows 98 yet." Video footage of this event became a popular Internet meme.[http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9804/21/windows.98/index.html?iref=allsearch Computer users on Windows 98: It's not revolutionary] == Second Edition == Windows 98 Second Edition (SE) was released in 1999. This was an official upgrade to Windows 98 which allowed people to use more types of computer hardware, like computer monitors and computer printers, and also let more than one machine on a computer network use the same Internet connection. ==References== ==Other websites== *[http://www.microsoft.com/windows98/ Windows 98 Homepage].
