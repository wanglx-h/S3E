It is the main town of part of Poland called Żagań County. It is now part of the in the Lubusz Voivodeship (a Voivoidship is part of the way Poland is organised into areas), before it was in Zielona Gora Voivodship (1975-1998). There is a castle called Sagan in the middle of an area that is also called Sagan. The castle belonged to Albrecht von Wallenstein, a soldier and politician of the Thirty Years' War. Later, the castle belonged to the Bohemian family of Lobkowitz. In 1786, the Sagan area was bought by Courland. In 1843, it went to his daughter Dorothea, the wife of Edmond de Talleyrand. An act of the king of Prussia on January 6, 1845 made her Duchess of Sagan. Napoleon III did the same in France, for her son Louis. The double title, both Prussian and French, meant that the duc de Sagan was a neutral party in the World War II. His house (the Château de Valençay) was a safe place to keep pictures and other things from the Louvre when Germany soldiers were in France. In the Second World War, the well-known war prison Stalag Luft was there. ==Other websites== *[http://www.um.zagan.pl/ The web page of the town.] *[http://mapa.szukacz.pl/?x=244269&y=422393&m=%afaga%f1&w=lubuskie&p=%bfaga%f1ski&g=%afaga%f1&z=3 A map.] *[http://www.dekorgraf.pl/oferta_wydawnicza.php?site=widokowki&site2=miasto_zagan Some pictures.] Category:Towns in Lubusz Voivodeship
