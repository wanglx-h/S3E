File:Audi max bochum.jpg The '''''' is one of the biggest universities in Germany. It is in the Ruhr Area, in the city of Bochum. == History == The Ruhr-Universität was the first public university founded in West Germany after World War II (in 1962). Later in the 1960s, education expanded in West Germany and more universities were founded. The Ruhr-University was the fourth largest university in Germany in the late 1980s and early 1990s with more than 40,000 students. But after the state of North Rhine-Westphalia decided to charge study fees, many students left the university and school examiners do not start studying anymore. Actually the fees were 1,000 Euro in the year (about 1,100 United States dollar), but the Ruhr-Area is traditionally a working class region. Summer Semester 2011 was the last semester with tuition fees. The number or students now is more than 40 000. The university of Bochum was one of the first to have Bachelor and master's degrees instead of the traditional German Diplom and Magister degree. == Present situation == Academically it is an upper middle-class university with a lot of international affairs, especially with Eastern Europe and Asia. The Ruhr-University Bochum lost some subjects when the state reduced its budget. The main focuses in research are Neuroscience, engineering, European law, Plasma (physics), Solid state, biochemistry, economics, Middle Ages and modern history, philosophy and Language. == Subjects == * Mathematics * Applied Computational Sciences * Physics and Astronomy * Chemistry and Biochemistry * Biology and Neuro Sciences * Geosciences (Geology, Geophysics, Mineralogy, Palentology) * Geography * Civil Engineering * Electro Engineering * Nanotechnology * Psychology * Medicine * Philosophy * History (Old, Middle Ages and New History, History of Arts) * Archeology Sciences * Chinese language(language and literature, there are regional studies for eastern Asia, too) * Eastern Asian Studies (China, Korea and Japan) * English language Language and Literature American and Canadian Literature * Romanic Languages and Literature (Italian, French, Spain, Portuguese) * Slavic languages and Literature (Russian, Polish) * German language Languages and Literature * Comparative Literature * Latin and Old Greek * Near and Middle Eastern Studies (Arabian Stuies, Indian) * Roman Catholic Theology * Protestant (Lutheran) Religious Studies * Economy * Laws * Social Sciences (Sociology, Social Psychology, Politics, Socail-Economical studies) * Environmental Studies * Development policy * Working Sciences * Sports * Music Sciences * Educational Sciences == Other websites == * [http://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/index_en.htm English website] ==References== Category:Bochum Category:Colleges and universities in North Rhine-Westphalia
