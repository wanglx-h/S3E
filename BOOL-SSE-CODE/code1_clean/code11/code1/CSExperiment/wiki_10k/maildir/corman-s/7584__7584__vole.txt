A '''vole''' is a small mouse-like mammal. It is a rodent from a family (biology) called the '''Arvicolinae'''. They live in woodlands and grasslands. There are about 155 species of voles. There are species in Europe, Asia, North Africa and North America. The closest relatives of voles are the lemmings and muskrats, which are in the same subfamily. Adult voles, depending on the species, are 7.5 to 17.5 centimetres (three to seven inches) long. They eat seeds, grass or other plants, and insects. Many animals hunt voles, for example owls, hawks, coyotes, foxes, weasels, cats and snakes. The average life of the smaller vole species is three to six months. These voles rarely live longer than 12 months. Larger species, such as the European water vole ''Arvicola'', live longer. They usually die during their second winter. As many as 88% of voles die during the first month of life.Daar, Sheila 1997. ''How to control voles in your garden''. VegetableGardener.com. Taunton Press. == References == Category:rodents
