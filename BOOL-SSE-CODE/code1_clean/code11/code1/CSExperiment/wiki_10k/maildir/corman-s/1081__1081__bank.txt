What they do is regulated by laws. Those laws differ in different Country. The people who work at a bank are called bank Employee. Certain banks deal directly with the public and are the only ones that a regular person will work with. Other banks deal with investments and international currency trading. The customer's money may be placed in the bank for safekeeping. Banks may give Loan to customers under an agreement to pay the money back to the bank at a later time, with interest. An example is getting a mortgage to buy a house or apartment. Banks also can use the money they have from deposit accounts to invest in Business to make more money. In most countries, the rules for banks are made by the government acting through Law. A central bank (such as the Bank of England) changes how much money is issued at a particular time. This is a factor in the economy of a country, and the government makes the big decisions. These "banks of issue" take in, and issue out, coins and banknotes. == History == The word ''bank'' comes from the Italian language word ''banco'', meaning ''a bench'', since Italian merchants in the Renaissance made deals to borrow and lend money beside a bench. They placed the money on that bench. Elementary financial records are known from the beginning of history.Mesopotamia of 8000 BC. Baked clay records were done before the invention of writing.Davies G. & Bank J.H. 2002. ''A history of money: from ancient times to the present day''. University of Wales Press. In the 17th century, merchants started storing their gold with goldsmiths in London. The goldsmiths had their own vaults and charged a fee for storing the merchants' gold. The goldsmiths eventually started loaning money using the gold left to them and also paid interest on the gold. The Bank of England began issuing banknotes in 1695. The oldest bank still in existence is Monte dei Paschi di Siena in Siena, Italy, which started in 1472. ==Banking activities== A bank usually provides the following services: * Checking account * Cheque books * Savings account * Money market account * Certificate of deposit (CD) * Individual retirement account (IRA) * Credit card * Debit card * Mortgage * Mutual fund * Personal loan * Time deposit * Automated teller machine * Transactional account ==Types of banks== * Community development bank: regulated banks that provide financial services and credit to under-served markets or populations. * Land development bank: The special banks providing long-term loans are called land development banks, in the short, LDB.
