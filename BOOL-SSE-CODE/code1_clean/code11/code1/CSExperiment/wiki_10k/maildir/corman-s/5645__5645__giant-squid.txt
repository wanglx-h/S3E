Giant squid can grow to a tremendous size: recent estimates put the maximum size at 12 metres (39ft) or 13 metres (43ft) for females and 10 metres (33ft) for males from caudal fin to the tip of the two long tentacles.McClain CR, Balk MA, Benfield MC, Branch TA, Chen C, Cosgrove J, Dove ADM, Gaskins LC, Helm RR, Hochberg FG, Lee FB, Marshall A, McMurray SE, Schanche C, Stone SN, Thaler AD. 2015.

[http://www.tonmo.com/science/public/giantsquidfacts.php "Giant Squid and Colossal Squid Fact Sheet".] The Octopus News Magazine Online. There is a larger squid, known as the Colossal Squid. Until 2005, nobody had ever seen a giant squid that was alive. Only dead giant squids had been found. On 30 September 2004, researchers from Japan took the first images of a live giant squid in its natural habitat.Kubodera T. & K. Mori 2005. ''Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences'', '''272'''(1581):2583-2586. Several of the 556 photographs were released a year later. The same team successfully filmed a live adult giant squid for the first time on December 4, 2006. There is no agreement as to how many species are members of the genus ''Architeuthis''. The Kraken is also believed to be a giant squid. == History == For many years, people would hear stories from fishermen about giant squids at sea. According to the stories, an enormous squid would wrap its arms around a whale, causing a terrible fight to start. Whalers said that sometimes, when they caught a whale, it would have scars as big as wikt:plate on its body. Other times, when they cut open the stomach of some of their whales, they would find squid arms as long as 30ft with suckers up to four inches wide. The whalers who told these stories either chopped up the squid parts to eat or use as bait, or they threw them back out to sea before scientists were ever able to wikt:examine them. However, in 1861, a French ship was able to bring back parts of a giant squid so scientists could study them. Then, in the late 18th century, several giant squids washed up on shore, proving that giant squids really exist. After that, many giant squids were found washed ashore or dead at sea. Scientists grew very wikt:interest in these mysterious creatures, but few ever saw them alive. Scientists think they spend most of their time in deep, cold ocean.

It had been caught by fishermen off the coast of New Zealand's South Island that year. The number of known giant squid specimens was close to 600 in 2004,Guerra A. A.F. González & F. Rocha 2004.
