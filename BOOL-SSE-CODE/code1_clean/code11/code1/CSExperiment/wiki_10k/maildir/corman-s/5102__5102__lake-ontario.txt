It forms most of the border between Ontario in Canada and New York (state) in the United States of America. Its inlet is the Niagara River (from Niagara Falls), and its outlet is the Saint Lawrence River. Nearly 9 million Canadians live near Lake Ontario. It is the only Great Lake that does not touch the U.S. state of Michigan, the "Great Lakes State". Category:Great Lakes Category:Lakes of Canada Category:Geography of Ontario
