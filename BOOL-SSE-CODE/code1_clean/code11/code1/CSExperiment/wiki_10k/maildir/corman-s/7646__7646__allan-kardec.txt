File:Alan Kardec 1.jpg '''Allan Kardec''' ('''Hippolyte Léon Denizard Rivail''' 3 October 1804 31 March 1869) was a French people philosopher and teacher. ==Works== He dedicated the last 15 years of his life to organise a philosophical doctrine called Spiritism. He spread the educational ideas of Pestalozzi in the 19th century. He published books on grammar, mathematics and suggestions for the improvement of public education in France. He was a teacher of physiology, astronomy, physics and chemistry. The classes were at his home in Paris. In 1854, Kardec started studying phenomena which some people call "paranormal" or "supernatural". This was quite common at that time. In his philosophy the spiritual manifestations were useful to the social and moral improvement of men. == Other websites == * [http://www.allan-kardec.org/ Allan Kardec Educational Society] * [http://www.allan-kardec.com/ ALLAN KARDEC: spiritisme, spiritism...] * [http://www.spiritwritings.com/kardec.html Allan Kardec Biographic Information] * [http://www.spiritwritings.com/kardecspiritstoc.html The Spirits' Book] by Allan Kardec ** [http://www.allankardec.com/Allan_Kardec/Le_livre_des_esprits/lesp_us.pdf Le Livre des Esprits] (PDF file) * [http://www.geae.inf.br/en/books/codification/mb.pdf The Book on Mediums] by Allan Kardec (PDF file) * [http://www.sgny.org/main/Books/ESE.pdf The Gospel According to Spiritism] by Allan Kardec (PDF file) Category:1804 births Category:1869 deaths Category:Burials at Père Lachaise Cemetery Category:French esotericists Category:Occultists Category:Writers from Lyon Category:19th-century French philosophers Category:French teachers Category:Parapsychology Category:Pseudonyms
