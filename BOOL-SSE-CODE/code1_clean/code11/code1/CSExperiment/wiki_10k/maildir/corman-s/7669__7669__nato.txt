"(..)the English and French texts [of the Treaty] are equally authentic(...)"[http://www.nato.int/docu/basictxt/treaty.htm#Art14 The North Atlantic Treaty, Article 14] | leader_title = Secretary General of NATO | leader_name = Mark Rutte | formation = 4 April 1949 | website = https://www.nato.int/ }} The '''North Atlantic Treaty Organization''' (sometimes known as the '''North Atlantic Alliance''', the '''Atlantic Alliance''' or the '''Western Alliance'''), also simply called '''NATO''', is a military alliance that is mostly in Europe and North America. Its other official name means the same in French language: ''Organisation du traité de l'Atlantique nord'' (''OTAN''). It was established by the North Atlantic Treaty, which was signed in Washington, D.C., United States, on April 4, 1949. Its headquarters are in Brussels, Belgium. == Languages == NATO has two official languages, English language and French language, as defined in Article 14 of the North Atlantic Treaty. == History == Its members when it was founded on April 4 1949 were the United States, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, the United Kingdom, Canada, Portugal, Italy, Norway, Denmark and Iceland. On 18 February 1952, Greece and Turkey also joined. When West Germany joined on 9 May 1955, it was described as "a decisive turning point in the history of our continent" by Norwegian Foreign Minister Halvard Lange. The Warsaw Pact was signed on 14 May 1955 by the Soviet Union and its satellite states as a defense to NATO. Iceland threatened to leave during the 1970s Cod Wars, which would put the United Kingdom at fault, and NATO would lose a key position in the North Atlantic Ocean. Iceland won the Cod Wars and did not end up leaving. After the Cold War ended, three former communist countries, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland, joined NATO in 1999. On 29 March 2004, seven more Northern Europe and Eastern European countries joined NATO: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania. Croatia and Albania received invitation for NATO membership on 3 April 2008. The Republic of Macedonia received only a conditional invitation because a full invitation was vetoed by Greece over a naming dispute. Montenegro joined on 5 June 2017. Having changed its name to end its dispute with Greece, North Macedonia joined NATO on 27 March 2020 and became its 30th member. Republic of Ireland became an observer of NATO on 8 September 2020. In April 2023, Finland joined NATO, following efforts to join since the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Sweden joined NATO in March 2024. == Membership == Here are the 32 NATO members: * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * {| class="skin-nightmode-reset-color" style="background:white; color: inherit; border:1px solid rgb(153, 153, 153); margin: 1em auto 1em auto; overflow:auto; overflow-x:auto; overflow-y:hidden;" |- style="text-align:center;" |File:NATO partnerships.svg |- style="font-size:85%;" | {|class="wikitable collapsible collapsed skin-nightmode-reset-color" style="background:white; color:inherit; border:1px solid white;" | style="border:0; width:2em;"| | style="border:0;"|'''NATO members''' | style="border:0; width:2em;"| | style="border:0;"|'''Membership Action Plan''' | style="border:0; width:2em;"| | style="border:0;"|'''Enhanced Opportunities Partners''' | style="border:0; width:2em;"| | style="border:0;"|'''Individual Partnership Action Plan''' | style="border:0; width:2em;"| | style="border:0;"|'''Partnership for Peace''' | style="border:0; width:2em;"| | style="border:0;"|'''Mediterranean Dialogue''' | style="border:0; width:2em;"| | style="border:0;"|'''Istanbul Cooperation Initiative''' | style="border:0; width:2em;"| | style="border:0;"|'''NATO global partners''' ! style="border:0; background:none; width:3.6em;"| |- valign="top" | style="border:0;" colspan="2"| | style="border:0;" colspan="2"| | style="border:0;" colspan="2"| | style="border:0;" colspan="2"| | style="border:0;" colspan="2"| | style="border:0;" colspan="2"| | style="border:0;" colspan="2"| | style="border:0;" colspan="3"| |} |} == Partnership For Peace == NATO also has a program called the Partnership for Peace (PfP), which is a program of cooperation between NATO and partner countries in/near Europe. the program includes Armenia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Ireland, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Malta, Moldova, Serbia, Switzerland, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan.File:World map with tropic of cancer.svg.]] ==Related pages== * United Nations == Further reading == * Asmus, Ronald D.
