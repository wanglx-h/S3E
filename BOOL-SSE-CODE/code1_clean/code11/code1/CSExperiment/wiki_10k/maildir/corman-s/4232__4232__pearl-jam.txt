Pearl Jam has sold around 85 million records worldwide in 2018 and are usually named one of the greatest bands of the 90's. After fellow Seattle band Mother Love Bone's lead singer, Andrew Wood, died in 1990, remaining members Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament went to look for a singer and a drummer for a new band. They came across Jack Irons which he soon passed on to Eddie Vedder, who worked at a gas station in California and occasionally surfed. He then recorded vocals for the songs "Alive", "Once", and "Footsteps". After he sent the demo to the members, Eddie flew to Seattle and joined the band. The band is made up of lead singer Eddie Vedder, guitarists Mike McCready and Stone Gossard, bassist Jeff Ament, and drummer Matt Cameron. Along with keyboardist Boom Gaspar and guitarist Josh Klinghoffer as touring members. The band had five drummers, which were Dave Krusen, Matt Chamberlain, Dave Abbruzzese, and Jack Irons.
