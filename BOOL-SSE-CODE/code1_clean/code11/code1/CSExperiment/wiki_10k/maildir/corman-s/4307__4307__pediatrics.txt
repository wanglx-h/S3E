Immunization is also called vaccination. In the nineteenth century, one in five children died before the age of five. Most of these deaths were from infection. Today ''some'' of these deaths are prevented by treating disease when it happens. Most of it is from preventing disease with immunizations. Pediatricians also try to prevent other diseases and injury before they happen. They teach parents about safety and nutrition.

Because childhood is such a time of change, prevention is a major part of pediatrics. == Types == Many pediatricians work as primary care doctors.
