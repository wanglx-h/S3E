The aim of graphics is to brand, inform, and have a specific effect on its audience.[http://guity-novin.blogspot.com/2010/02/history-of-graphic-design-medium-is.html A history of graphic design] ==History of graphics== Hundreds of graphic designs of animals were made by primitive people in Chauvet cave, in the south of France, about 30,000BC.Chauvet, Jean-Marie; Eliette Brunel Deschamps, Christian Hillaire (1996). Dawn of Art: The Chauvet Cave. Paul G. Bahn (Foreword), Jean Clottes (Epilogue). New York: Harry N. Abrams. Also, similar art was done in the Lascaux cave, France, about 14,000BC.The Cave of Lascaux, by Mario Ruspoli, Harry N. Abrams 1987. The art of primitive hunters is found in the rocks of Bhimbetka in India, drawn earlier than 7,000BC.

Among these books are Bibles that were created in the monastery in Ireland, Scotland, and England. Spiral and interlocking patterns, often including small figures, were part of the ancient graphic tradition of the British Isles. From the 6th century onwards these were applied to the decoration of Illuminated manuscript Gospel.

Japanese used calligraphy to write haiku. ===Graphics in Quran=== In Islam countries the graphic designs can be found in their holy book, the Quran. The Quran was first written an angled style called Kufi. This appeared in the 8th century, and reached its peak in the 10th century. Later on decoration of Margins, page and other graphic techniques were added to beautify the book. In the 12th century the Naskh (script) script was invented: it used curves instead of angled lines. Other styles were added later on.Drogin, Marc 1980. ''Medieval calligraphy: its history and technique''. New York: Dover.Miner, Dorothy E. ''et al'' 1972.

London: Nabu Publications, 1997 == Birth of modern graphic design == William Morris had an influence on modern graphics. In the second half of 19th century his Kelmscott Press produced many graphic designs, and created a collector market for this kind of art. In Oxford he was associated with artists like Edward Burne Jones, and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. They formed the Pre-Raphaelites group, whose ideas influenced modern graphic design considerably.See: Encarta [http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761563639/William_Morris.html] , and Larousse [http://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/#larousse/1170/102/Morris] File:Morris Peacock and Dragon Fabric 1878 v2.jpg|This fabric design 'Peacock and Dragon', the work of William Morris (1878), is a beautiful example of decorative graphic design.

File:Rubaiyat Morris Burne-Jones Manuscript.jpg| This book of poetry, by the famous Persian poet Omar Khayyam, is a graphic calligraphy and decorative design by Morris, and painting by Edward Burne-Jones. == Mondrian's minimalism revolution == The Dutch painter Piet Mondrian in the years 1920–21 courageously introduced the style of minimalism in painting. His simple geometric compositions, together with the use of only three basic colors, blue, yellow, and red, in combination with black and white created a new venue for the graphic designers. He demonstrated that with simple relocation of these colors, and experimenting with the proportionality of various square surfaces, one can achieve extremely different ambiances and various feelings. For the graphic designers who intend to convey a message with a minimum interference from the extraneous elements his experiment in minimalism was a valuable gift.

File:Elementary love.jpg |A '''rebus''' is a kind of word puzzle which uses pictures to represent words, such as "T,4,2" instead of "tea for two".

Heraldic signs were created under strict rules and traditions. === Logos and trademarks === A '''trademark''', identified by the symbols trademark symbol and registered trademark symbol, or '''mark''' is a distinctive sign or indicator used by an individual, company or other entity to identify its products or services and to distinguish them from those of other producers. A trademark is a type of intellectual property, and typically a name, word, phrase, logo, symbol, design, image, or a combination of these elements.See: the ''Random House Unabridged Dictionary'', © Random House, Inc. 2006. File:Coca-Cola logo.svg| Coca-Cola by Frank Mason Robinson in 1885.There is no proof as to who designed it. Master penman Louis Madarasz (1859–1910) said the work was his. The writing style is similar to his. In ''An Elegant Hand'' by William E Henning, it states that Frank Mason Robinson, the bookkeeper of the firm, invented the name Coca-Cola, and said it should be written in Spencerian script. In a 1914 court case, Robinson testified that he was "practically the originator" and that "some engraver by the name of Frank Ridge was brought into it".

In 1925, the Museum of Economy and Society used such graphics for the public. This style of presentation at the time was called the Viennese method, but now it is known as Isotype charts.[http://www.stroom.nl/paginas/pagina.php?pa_id=6422177 Stroom Den Haag] File:Isotype-neurath.jpg | Typical Isotype chart showing social statistics.

''The Art of 3-D : Computer animation and imaging'', 2nd ed, Wiley. File:5-cell.gif|The art of computer graphic designs is still at its infancy. With modern techniques the horizon has been expanded for graphic designers. == Placards and posters == Placards and posters existed from ancient times. The Greek ''axons'' and the Roman ''Albums'', with their decorative designs and announcements, were quite similar to today's posters. In ancient Greece the names of Athlete and games Schedule were written on columns that were slowly turning on an Axis of rotation. Romans used whitewashed walls in their markets in which sellers, Moneylenders, and Slave trade wrote their announcements and advertised for their products, and to attract the attention of customers they added an attractive design.[http://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/#larousse/1441/11/affiche Larousse] With the invention of printing, in 1440, and particularly the development of the Lithography process, invented by a Czechs named Alois Senefelder in 1798 in Austria, creation of posters became feasible. Although handmade posters existed before, they were mainly used for government announcements. William Caxton, who in 1477 started a printing company in England, produced the first printed poster. In 1870, the advertising poster emerged.In the 19th and 20th century artists like Jules Chéret, Daumier, Manet, Picasso, Ben Shahn, Norman Rockwell, Alexandre Steinlen, Alphonse Mucha, and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec made compelling posters, advertising products, entertainment, and restaurants. Matt Morgan's circus advertisements (c. 1890) started the American poster, and this was followed by Edward Penfield, Will H. Bradley, Maxfield Parrish, Howard Chandler Christie, James Montgomery Flagg, Charles Dana Gibson, and Harrison Fisher.See: M. Rickards 1971. ''The rise and fall of the poster''; J. Barnicoat 1972. ''A concise history of posters: 1870–1970''; D. Ades 1984. ''The twentieth century poster''; J. Barnicoat 1985.

File:Gustav Klimt 046.jpg| The works of Gustav Klimt are a clear example of the influence of graphic design on painting.see: ''GUSTAV KLIMT: Art Nouveau Visionary'', By Eva di Stefano, Sterling, 2008, See: ''Gustav Klimt: 1862-1918'', by Gilles Neret, Taschen (August 1, 1999), Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer == Posters after World War II == After the Second World War, with the emergence of new color printing technology and particularly appearance of computers, the art of posters underwent a new revolutionary phase. People can create color posters on their computers and create color prints at a very low cost. With the emergence of the internet, the role of posters in conveying information has greatly diminished. However, some artists still use chromolithography in order to create works of art in the form of print. In this regard the difference between painting and print has been narrowed considerably. File:Poster loveulster.gif| This political poster by Tiocfaidh Ár Lá, about Ulster, is a low-cost, effective poster with only a few basic ink colors. == Graphic design in modern life == Today graphic design has penetrated into all aspects of modern life. In particular modern architecture has been influenced by graphics.See: ''A History of Modern Design: Graphics and Products Since the Industrial Revolution'', by David Raizman, Laurence King Publishing (February 9, 2004), File:Spiral-jetty-from-rozel-point.png|Robert Smithson's ''Spiral Jetty'' (1970) on the Great Salt Lake in Utah.
