He was, by Custom, a slave of Africa Descendant who lived from about 620 BC to 560 BC in Ancient Greece. ==Life== The tradition is that he was at one point freed from slavery and that he eventually died at the hands of Delphi, Greece. In fact, the doubt about his life has led some to deny his existence altogether. ==Aesop's Fables== File:Aesopus - Aesopus moralisatus, circa 1485 - 2950804 Scan00010.tif''Aesop's Fables'' or ''Aesopica'' refers to a collection of fables credited to Aesop. The ''Aesop's Fables'' has also become a blanket term for collections of brief fables, usually involving Personification animals. The most famous fable is a parable of the tortoise and the hare. In this story, a rabbit challenges a tortoise to a race. The rabbit is sure of its victory and as a result, depending on the version of the story, in some way completes the race slower than the turtle. Often, the hare takes a nap or takes too many breaks. The persistent tortoise, despite being slower, wins because it persevered. No writings by him survive. Tales credited to him were gathered across the Century and in List of languages. This is a storytelling Custom that continues to the present day. Many of the tales have Animal and inanimate objects that act like Human. ===Influence=== The Quran figure ''Luqman'' () is often identified with Aesop, whose lore is found in several ancient cultures.https://books.google.com/books?id=pMuxLlWih04C&dq=luqman+generally+identified+with+aesop&pg=PA70https://books.google.com/books?id=W3rjDAAAQBAJ&dq=luqman+aesop&pg=PT202https://books.google.com/books?id=NoqDBwAAQBAJ&dq=luqman+reference+to+aesop&pg=PA368 At some time during the Middle Ages, much was transferred to Luqman that was told in Europe of Aesop.https://books.google.com/books?id=jJY3AAAAIAAJ&dq=luqman+traditionally+aesop&pg=PA812 This identification with Aesop is confirmed by the fact that many of the fables ascribed to Aesop in the west are referred to Luqman in the east.https://books.google.com/books?id=Oc88AAAAIAAJ&dq=luqman+similar+to+aesop&pg=PR76 The fables remain a popular choice for moral education of children today. Many stories included in Aesop's Fables, such as ''The Fox and the Grapes'' – from which the idiom "sour grapes" was derived, ''The Tortoise and the Hare'' (see Zeno's paradoxes) and ''The Shepherd Boy and the Wolf'', also known as ''The Boy Who Cried Wolf'', are well known throughout the world. Aesop's Fables are still taught as moral lessons and used as subjects for entertainment, especially children's plays and Cartoon. Aesop is said to have written thousands of fables, but none has been verified. This means we do not know whether he wrote any, or perhaps just collected them. ==Related pages== * Homer * ''The Odyssey'' * Ancient Greek philosophy ==Sources== * Caxton, John, 1484.
