In 1819, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador and Panama declared independence from Spain, and formed a country called "''Gran Colombia''". Venezuela and Ecuador separated in 1830. Panama continued to be part of Colombia until 1903, at which point it proclaimed independence. The official language is Spanish language, but there are many languages spoken by minorities that are official in local jurisdictions. == History == File:Columbus Taking Possession.jpg came to America leading the Spanish. He gave the name of "Colombia" to what is today "America".]] === Before the Spanish === The land where Colombia now stands has been home to people for more than 20,000 years. The first people had many groups, cultures, and languages. There are many tools, caves, and things of those peoples. In Colombia, the peoples were similar to those of Asia, because scientists say that the first people came to Americas from Siberia or southeast Asia more than 50,000 years ago. The peoples of Colombia were called Arawak, Caribe, and Chibcha, but there were many other groups. The most famous were the Muiscas. legend of El Dorado comes from the Muiscas. The king of the Muiscas used to bathe in Lake Guatavita and he used a lot of gold for his bath. The Spanish heard about this, and the people told them that there was a great golden city somewhere. They started to look for El Dorado. The International Airport of Bogotá is called El Dorado International Airport, because the legend was born in Colombia. The descendants of the first peoples of Colombia live integrated with others. Some groups live in the forest, but many live in the countryside and in the cities. === The colony === The Spanish, led by Christopher Columbus, first came to Americas in 1492. Columbus saw the coasts of Venezuela, Colombia and Panama and he gave them his own name. But Alonso de Ojeda was the first colonist to explore the area of the Gulf of Darién. After that, the Spanish founded the first European cities on the American continent: Santa Marta in 1525 and Cartagena de Indias in 1533. It was from Colombia that the Spanish conquered the Incas of Peru. Spain would Slavery the indigenous peoples who were already living there, but they also used the port they built at Cartagena to bring many Black people slaves from Africa into the area. The Spanish captured many, many people from Africa and forced them to work on plantations and ranches, in Mining, and as personal servants. While this was happening, they founded the city of Popayán in 1536 and they conquered the ''Confederation of the Muiscas''. In Bacatá, the capital of the Muiscas, the Spanish founded the city of Bogotá in 1538. In 1550 the Spanish declared the territory as a colony and its capital was ''Santa Fe de Bogotá'', but in the first decades it depended on Peru. Soon after, it was declared a Viceroyalty. === Independence === On November 11, 1810, the city of Cartagena de Indias declared its independence from Spain. The whole region would fight a war to become independent, led by people like Antonio Nariño and Simón Bolívar. Nariño was one of the most important leaders in the war for the independence of Colombia. He was a politician, journalist and soldier. Bolivar was another important leader, and he was a president and a colonel. Bolivar had promised Alexandre Pétion, the president of Haiti, that he would Abolitionism slavery during his independence war. But he only agreed because he was afraid the slaves would revolt against the slaveowners, Haitian Revolution, and only freed slaves if they agreed to fight in his army. He never freed all the slaves, and slavery was not abolished in Colombia until 1851. ==Geography== The geography of Colombia has six main natural regions, Each has its own unique characteristics.
