File:Upper Jaw Dentition.jpeg '''Dentition''' is the development of teeth and where the teeth are in the mouth. Almost all mammals have up to four different types of teeth: incisors, canine tooths, premolars, and molars. Animals that have different types of teeth are called '''"heterodont"'''. If they do not, they are called '''"homodont"'''. In mammals, the young have a set of '''primary teeth''' (milk teeth) that fall out after a few years. When they fall out, adult teeth grow in. Animals that have milk teeth and adult teeth are called '''diphyodont'''. == Archaeology == Dentition is important in archaeology. Dentition is used to study human migration. Tooth Tooth enamel contains trace elements which show where they grew. == Related pages == *Teeth *Dental formula == References == *Adovasion J. M. and David Pedler. 2005.
