They are known for their 1981 hit single "867-5309/Jenny", which peaked at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100. Some people consider the band to be a one-hit wonder. This is despite "Angel Say No" reaching the Top 40 the year before. The band's lead singer, rhythm guitarist, and occasional keyboardist is Thomas Allen Heath. He was born in 1947 and is also known as Tommy Heath. He is the only active original member currently touring as Tonmy Tutone. Heath grew up in Philadelphia, Texas, and Montana. He moved to San Francisco during the Summer of Love to become a hippie. There, he formed the band with Jim Keller and Terry Nails in 1978. He named it after his nickname. The band's first single, "Angel Say No", was released in 1980 and reached the top 40. They even opened for Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers on tour for ''Damn the Torpedoes''. The band's second album, ''Tommy Tutone 2'', was released in 1981 and featured "867-5309/Jenny". The song became so popular that people in the United States still prank call the number and ask for Jenny today. In 2006, VH1 named it the 36th-greatest song of the 1980s. As of January 2024, Heath is living in Portland, Oregon. He's back touring as Tommy Tutone. A new studio album is set to release the fall of 2024. == Discography == * Tommy Tutone (1980) * Tommy Tutone 2 (1981) * National Emotion (1983) * Nervous Love (1996) * Tutone.rtf (1998) * Beautiful Ending (2019) == References == Category:American rock bands Category:Pop rock bands Category:new wave bands Category:Musical groups from California
