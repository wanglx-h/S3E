Subject: List of Nobel Peace Prize winners
The '''Nobel Peace Prize''' is one of six awards in the memory of Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite. Every year the organization gives out six awards for the people "who best benefit mankind through their actions" in one of the six subjects; peace, literature, physics, chemistry, economics, and medicine. The Peace Prize is given out in Norway, but the other Nobel Prize are given out in Sweden. This is because Norway and Sweden were Union between Sweden and Norway when the prizes were started. Its list of winners includes Muhammad Yunus, Martin Luther King, Jr., Elihu Root, Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Henri La Fontaine, Mikhail Gorbachev, Aung San Suu Kyi, Nelson Mandela, Kofi Annan, Jimmy Carter, Wangari Maathai, Barack Obama, Liu Xiaobo, Juan Manuel Santos, Abiy Ahmed and Lech Wałęsa (Polish pronunciation: [ˈlɛɣ vaˈwɛ̃sa]; born 29 September 1943) is a Polish statesman, dissident, and Nobel Peace Prize laureate who served as the president of Poland between 1990 and 1995. There is often a lot of controversy about the award of the prize. The 2013 winner is the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, making it the second year in-a-row that an organization has won the prize, after the European Union did so in 2012.
