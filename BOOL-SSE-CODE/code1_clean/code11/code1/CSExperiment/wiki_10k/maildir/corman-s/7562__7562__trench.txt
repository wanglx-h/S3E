Entrenched soldiers can be somewhat safe from enemy fire. Trench warfare made World War I longer than expected. The trench coat got its name from there. Several kinds of trench exist: * ''Utility trench'' has pipes, wires, or other infrastructure * ''Road trench'' carries vehicles * ''Military trench'' provides shelter for soldiers shooting at each other * ''Oceanic trench'': For example, the Mariana Trench *''Rift valley'' * ''Archaeological trench'' dug by archaeologists Category:Landforms Category:War
