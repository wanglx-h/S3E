It has many old Spanish words and Hebrew language words. ==History== During the Middle Ages, many Jews lived in Spain. They were called Sephardi Jews Jews or ''Sephardim'' (in Hebrew language). Antisemitism#Spain after the country was taken over by Christianity, they brought the old Spanish with them to their new countries. Some Sephardic Jews still speak Ladino in Israel, Turkey, Bulgaria, the United States and other countries. * * * * * * Just as many other Jewish languages, Ladino is an endangered language and is in danger of language death. It could become an extinct language. Most Native speaker are old because many of them emigration to Israel and did not pass on the language to their children or grandchildren. In some Sephardic Jewish communities in Latin America and elsewhere, there is a threat of language extinction because of Cultural assimilation into modern Spanish. ==Writing== Ladino is usually written by using the Latin alphabet, but in Israel it uses the Hebrew language#Alphabet. ==Ladin language== Ladino should not be confused with the Ladin language, which is related to the Romansh language and Friulian languages and is mostly spoken in the Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol region of Northern Italy. ==Related pages== * Yiddish * Mizrahi Jews * Maghrebi Jews * Jew#History * Sephardic Jews * Ashkenazi Jews * Spanish Inquisition ==References== == Other websites == * Socolovsky, Jerome.
