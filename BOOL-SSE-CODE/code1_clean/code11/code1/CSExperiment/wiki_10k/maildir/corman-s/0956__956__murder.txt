Subject: Murder
'''Murder''' is where one person kills another person with aforethought. ("The unlawful killing of another human being without justification or excuse.") ("The killing of another person without justification or excuse, especially the crime of killing a person with malice aforethought or with recklessness manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life.") If a person does something reckless that makes someone else die, without the intention of killing, it is homicide and may be manslaughter. An accident caused by carelessness may be negligent homicide. Sometimes, a death caused by someone else may not be a crime, for example killing in self-defense. Though, if the killer could've stopped a violent encounter without killing the victim, it's generally ''not'' a lawful killing. File:Jakub Schikaneder - Murder in the House.JPG A person who commits murder is called a murderer. The legal definition of "murder" and "manslaughter" may be different between country. A killing in war is not usually called "murder" by those who fight in the war, as it's justifiable homicide. Killing in self defense is usually not "murder". Some countries do not even have manslaughter as a legal concept, and only have murder; the countries that do not have manslaughter charge with murder instead. In fact, the United States did not have manslaughter on the books until the 20th century. England was the first country to indoctrinate manslaughter, and the United States was second. == Most common circumstances for murder in the United States (1999) == A total of 12,658 murders were reported in 1999 in the U.S., including 1,903 without a specified reason, and 3,779 for which the reasons were unknown. # Argument (unspecified) (3,391) # Robbery (1,010) # Juvenile gang killing (579) # Contravention of narcotic drug laws (564) # Argument over money or property (211) # Brawl due to influence of alcohol (187) # Romantic triangle (133) # Gangland killing (116) # Brawl due to influence of narcotics (111) # Burglary (79) == Worst cities for murder in the United States (1999) == New York's status as the murder capital of the world improved during the 1990s.

(241) # Dallas, Texas (191) # New Orleans, Louisiana (158) # Atlanta, Georgia (143) == Attempted murder == Attempted murder is a crime. Attempted murder, or "attempt murder" in common law country, also sometimes called "murder attempt", is when someone tries to wikt:kill another person.Michael Costa; Mark Duffy, ''Australian HIV/AIDS Legal Guide'' (Sydney: Federation Press, 1991), p. 48 Just wikt:planning a murder is not enough. The act must come close to, but does not actually take the life of the other person. It was punishable by death and the execution was carried out in Ancient Egypt, Ancient Mesopotamia, the Indus River Valley, Ancient Greece, The Roman Empire, and of course, China, which is by far the most populated country in the world, to this day. The Roman Empire carried out about ten thousand executions, most if not all beheadings, during its time, and there is no doubt that many of these were those convicted of attempted murder. ==Assassination== "Assassination" is a word which means murdering a prominent person for a reason. The word is most used when the person who was killed was a celebrity or was a person involved in politics. The people who carry out assassinations are called "assassins" or "Hit-men". An assassin may murder someone for political reasons, for money, or for other reasons, such as favors owed and revenge. The word "Assassin" comes from Hashishin,''American Speech'' - McCarthy, Kevin M. Volume 48, pp. 77-83 a Muslim group that was active in the Middle East from the 8th to the 14th centuries. This secret society killed people for politics and religion reasons.Secret Societies Handbook, Michael Bradley, Cassell Illustrated, 2005. It is thought that the assassins were under the influence of hashish and opium during their killings or during their training. The word ''assassin'' comes from either ''hashashim'', the influence of the drugs, or ''hassansin'', after their leader, Hassan-i Sabbah. == Murdersuicide == A '''murdersuicide''' is when a person kills someone else (murder), and then they kill themselves (suicide). No one is tracking the number of murder–suicides in the United States. However, medical studies estimate between 1,000 and 1,500 deaths per year in the United States are murder-suicides.[http://www.vpc.org/studies/amroul2006.pdf American Roulette: Murder–Suicide in the United States. Violence Policy Center] == Degrees of murder == Murder often comes in three degrees: first, second, and third degree murder. First degree murder is considered murder that has been planned out prior to being committed, and this ranges from stalkers to those who assassinate. Second degree murder is considered murder in action, or murder that was committed with intent to kill, but without planning. Third degree murder is when someone kills someone without intent or planning. An example could be in a drunken bar fight. Two men are fighting, both drunk, and one kills another accidentally. While the killer did not intend nor plan to kill the other man, he committed third degree murder by killing him. == Related pages == File:Assassination of Inejiro Asanuma 01.jpg by Otoya Yamaguchi, October 1960]] * John Wilkes Booth * John Lennon * Lee Harvey Oswald * Gavrilo Princip * James Earl Ray * Nathuram Godse * Otoya Yamaguchi * 1972 Queenstown shooting * Michael Swango ==References== Category:Murders
