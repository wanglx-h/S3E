The name "Nova Scotia" is Latin for "New Scotland". The capital city and largest city is Halifax, Nova Scotia. People who live in Nova Scotia are called Nova Scotians. There are over 1 million of them; over 500,000 of whom live in Halifax. What is now Nova Scotia used to be controlled by the Mik'maq. The France settled among them at Port Royal after 1600, and called the land part of Acadia, with Port Royal as its capital. In 1710, after a war, the United Kingdom captured Port Royal and went on to capture the rest of the peninsula. It was the first time that the British had captured and held a French colonial empire. On 6 December 1917, about 2,000 people were killed in the Halifax Explosion. Nova Scotia's government of Canada is a democracy. Tim Houston is the premier and Mike Savage is the lieutenant governor. ==References== == Other websites == * [http://maps.gov.ns.ca/ Nova Scotia Govt online map archive] Category:1867 establishments in Canada Category:Nova Scotia
