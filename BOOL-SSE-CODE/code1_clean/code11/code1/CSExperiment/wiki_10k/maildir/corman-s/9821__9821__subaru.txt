Subaru builds cars in Japan and also builds cars in the state of Indiana. Their cars are known for having '''all-wheel drive,''' which means that the engine drives all four wheels, instead of just the wheels in the front or in the back. They also have boxer engines, which means that the pistons and the cylinders in the engine fire left to right instead of up and down or at an angle. The name Subaru is a Japanese word for a star cluster in the sky named Pleiades, and the company logo has the stars in its picture in the same place as they are in the sky. ==History== Image:Subaru 1500.jpg Fuji Heavy Industries in 1954 built a car called the Subaru P-1.
