It is in the Rhein-Neckar-Kreis area of Baden-Württemberg, Germany and close to Sinsheim. Eschelbronn is in the north of Kraichgau with a distance of about 25 km to Heidelberg. ==History== It was already mentioned in the years 788/789 in a document of the monastery of Lorsch. Afterwards there was no documentation until the end of the 13th century when it became part of the restrict of Speyer. The first mayor was Heinrich von Eschelbrunnen in the year 1261. In 1267 a castle made of wood was built and later rebuilt into a water-castle of stone in 1375. In 1526 the village became Protestant. In 1803 Eschelbronn became part of Baden. From 1807 on the village was administered by Waibstadt and 1803 by Sinsheim until the 31st of December 1972. Today it belongs to the Rhein-Neckar area. In former times most of the people were farmers, however later in the 18th century the production of textiles became more and more important. Since the end of the 19th century Eschelbronn is well known for its furniture production. == Other websites == * [http://www.eschelbronn.de Official website] * [http://www.schreinermuseum.de Museum of Furniture Production] Category:Villages in Baden-Württemberg Category:Municipalities in Baden-Württemberg
