In 2004 about 1,088,300 people lived in Yerevan. Some people write Yerevan as '''Erevan'''. In past, Yerevan was called '''Erebuni''' or '''Erivan'''. It is on the Hrazdan River, and is the administrative, cultural, and industrial center of the country. The history of Yerevan dates back to the 8th century BC, with the founding of the Urartian fortress of Erebuni in 782 BC.
