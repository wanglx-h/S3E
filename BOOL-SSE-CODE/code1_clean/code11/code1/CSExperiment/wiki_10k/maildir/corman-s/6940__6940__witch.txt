File:Devil hugging a witch.jpg]]A '''witch''' is a person (often female) who practices witchcraft, magic or potions. In modern times, they have become characterised with pointed hats, black cloaks and Broom. Traditionally, the word “witch” was used as an accusation. Witches were accused of bewitching people, or casting spells to control them. In some societies, they were seen as evil, but in others, witches were viewed positively.

Note that the practitioners of Wicca are completely unrelated to the historical witches, this article is about. == History == Most indigenous peoples throughout History of the world have had some beliefs about spirits and believed that certain individuals could gain magical powers through herbs or spirits. However, these individuals were not called 'witches' until indigenous people had contact with western ideas. Spirits and people who interacted with them were not always viewed negatively in indigenous societies. === ''The Malleus Maleficarum'' === The ''Malleus Maleficarum'', a book published in 1487, fueled [https://simple.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/panic panic] over witchcraft''.'' It was written by a German people Catholicism clergyman named Heinrich Kramer. The book was a witch-hunting manual that explained how to Persecution witches. It suggested using torture to get accused witches to [https://simple.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/confess confess] to witchcraft. It also encouraged Death by burning. The new technology of the printing press made it possible for ''Malleus Maleficarum'' to be Mass production. The book was printed 29 times before 1669 - more than any other book except the Bible. As a result, its ideas spread throughout Europe. These ideas were common in Europe for several Century after the book was published. The book says that three things are needed in order to create witchcraft: the witch’s evil intentions, the Devil help, and God permission. === Witch Hunts === Many women throughout Europe and in South America were killed by witch hunts. Historians debate how many women were killed. Because of poor record keeping, it is impossible to know exactly how many victims there were. Also, historians have different opinions about what regions and time frames should be included when estimating how many women were killed in witch hunts. The entire persecuting legal system - "judges, ministers, priests, constables, jailers, judges, doctors, prickers, torturers, jurors, executioners" - were nearly all male. Meanwhile, the victims were overwhelmingly female. For this reason, some scholars call the witch hunts a "gynocide". In the documentary ''The Burning Times'', Thea Jensen calls this period in history a "Women's The Holocaust". == Modern understanding == File:Paganavebury.jpg In the 20th century, many people made a new attempt to understand witchcraft. Some say that witches were in fact wise women who were hunted down by the Catholic Church - mostly for their knowledge about how to treat certain diseases using herbs. Some followers of Paganism like Wicca began to call themselves witches. This has led to a new understanding of what a “witch” really is. Heather Marsh has tied the persecution of witches to the fight of church and industry to control "the power of life and death" at a time when industry needed more workers. She also argues the persecution of witches was a fight for centralized power over the peasant rebellions and the ownership of knowledge by medicine and science which forbade the earlier teaching or practices by women and indigenous cultures. She writes that the persecution of witches has colored misogyny since the 1400s. Silvia Federici tied the witch hunts to a history of the female body in the transition to capitalism.Silvia Federici 2004. ''Caliban and the Witch: women, the body and primitive accumulation''. Witchcraft and accusations of witchcraft are still very common in some parts of West Africa. == Witch crimes in the ''Malleus Maleficarum'' == File:J. Sprenger and H.
