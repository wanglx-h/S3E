Some scholars initially attributed an age of 11,000 years to it; others, 5,000, and some have even suggested 3,000 years. This individual was initially identified as a man, but recent research identifies it as a woman, although this is a matter of debate. ==Related pages== * Coat of arms of Mexico (state) * Flag of Mexico (state) Category:Mexico (state)
