It includes any mixture of combat disciplines or any blend of two or more styles of martial arts like boxing and kick boxing, which are its integral fighting styles. MMA can also mean the sport of mixed martial arts fighting. Bellator, PFL, Rizin, ONE Championship, and Ultimate Fighting Championship are companies that promote MMA sport fighting. == Rules == The people who organize an MMA fight can decide the rules for that fight. There is no one group of people who decides the rules for '''all''' MMA fights, in the world. Some states regulate all professional fights, including MMA fights, and set some rules. MMA fights once had few rules, but now have many rules to protect the fighters. Boxing (and other fighting sports) also have many rules, different from those in MMA. Fighters can use any martial art, or combination of arts, they like in the fight. In these fights, fighters can fight standing with punch (strike)es, kicks and other strikes, in a clinch where fighters are grabbing each other while standing, or on the ground. === Illegal strikes === An example of an illegal strike is the 12-6 elbow strike. It is illegal under the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts, where it is called "striking downwards using the point of the elbow". The ban was made for medical / safety reasons, because of serious injuries caused by this strike. === Defeat === Each fighter will try to defeat the other either by submission, or knock out. Each fight can last only for a period of time, after the time ends, judges decide who is the winner. The referee in the fight will make sure no one gets hurt too badly and that rules are followed. == History of the Mixed Martial Arts == === Origin === Pankration was an old style of unarmed combat. The ancient Ancient Greece introduced this sport into the Olympic Games in the 648 BC. Some public fights took place at the end of the 19th century. They represented different styles of fighting, including jujutsu, wrestling, Greco-Roman wrestling and others in competitions and challenges throughout Europe. After World War I, wrestling was born again in two main flows. The first flow was real competition; the second flow began to depend more on the choreography and on the grand public shows that resulted in professional wrestling. === Types of martial arts === Modern mixed martial arts (MMA) has its roots in two kinds of competition: the Vale Tudo (Brazil) and Japanese Shootfighting. ==== Vale Tudo ==== Vale Tudo began circa 1930, when Carlson Gracie invited every competitor to compete in a fight. That was the so-called "Gracie's Challenge". Later, Hélio Gracie and the Gracie family continued this. Vale Tudo translates to "Anything Goes", as it had almost no rules. ==== Japanese Shootfighting ==== In Japan, about 1970, Antonio Inoki organized a series of mixed martial arts fights. They were the forces that produced the Shootwrestling, and they later caused the developing of the first organization of mixed martial arts, known as Shooto. Mixed martial arts obtained great popularity in the United States in 1993, when Rorion Gracie helped create the first UFC event, one of the earliest MMA events in the USA . In 1997, in Japan, the interest for this sport resulted in the creation of the greater organization of mixed martial arts - Pride Fighting Championship. === Where they were practiced === The Gracie family caused the tournaments, as the UFC, to be well known. It should be noticed that the UFC is the most famous tournament, but the persons who practises Brazilian jiujitsu normally do not use blows. Undoubtedly, the Gracie family played an important role in the creation of open competitions of Vale Tudo and in causing them to be well known through the television. Nevertheless, before anyone created the UFC or Shooto, where the persons who represent every method of self-defense can fight, there had already existed such mixed martial arts. == Gradual development of the competitors == About the year 1990, four styles were famous for their effectiveness in the competitions of the mixed martial arts: boxing, the wrestling, the Brazilian jiu-jitsu, and Muay Thai. This can be because of their attention given to the combat by means of holds. Before the year 1990, the promoters organized a lacking amount of the competitions of the mixed martial arts, and some martial arts base on blows. Therefore, probably, most instructors of these arts had given too little attention to the holds. ==References== == Other websites == * [http://www.yakinsavunma.com/ World free fighting organization] * [http://www.dovuscu.com/ World amateur sport Kickboxing Organization (W.A.S.K.O. )] - & kickboxing === North America === ==== The United States ==== * [http://www.ufc.tv Ultimate Fighting Championship] * [http://www.kingofthecage.com King Of The Cage] * [http://www.ifl.tv International Fighting League] ==== Canada ==== * [http://www.emixedmartialarts.com/ MMA CANADA] === South America === ==== Brazil ==== * Meca FC * Storm Samurai * Jungle Fight * International Vale Tudo Championship === Europe === ==== United Kingdom ==== * [http://www.cagerage.tv Cage Rage] * [http://www.cagewarriors.com Cage Warriors] ==== Denmark & Sweden ==== * [http://www.europeanvaletudo.com European Vale Tudo (Denmark, Sweden)] ==== Spain ==== * [http://www.koarena.com KO Arena ] ==== Poland ==== * [http://www.konfrontacja.com/ Konfrontacja Sztuk Walki (The Martial Arts Confrontation)] === Asia === ==== Japan ==== * [http://www.pridefc.com Pride Fighting Championship] * Pancrase * Shooto * K-1 Hero's Category:Mixed martial arts
