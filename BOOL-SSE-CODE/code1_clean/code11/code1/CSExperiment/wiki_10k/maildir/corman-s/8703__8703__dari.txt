It is the Persian language as spoken in Afghanistan. It is the second official language of Afghanistan, and is widely used by the government and most media agencies. It is mainly spoken by the Tajiks and other minority groups. A small minority also exists in parts of Pakistan closest to these named regions.Ch. M. Kieffer, ''"AFGHANISTAN v. Languages"'', in Encyclopædia Iranica, Online Edition 2010, ([http://iranica.com/articles/afghanistan-v-languages] ). It is sometimes called Farsi. People in Afghanistan and Iran who speak Persian can understand each other. The name Dari was given to the Persian language at a very early date.G. Lazard, ''"DARĪ"'', in Encyclopædia Iranica, Online Edition 2010, ([http://iranica.com/articles/dari] ). Historically, Dari was the court language of the Sassanids.Frye, R.N., "Darī", ''The Encylcopaedia of Islam'', Brill Publications, CD version ==Related pages== * Pashto language * Languages of Afghanistan == References == Category:Persian language Category:Languages of Afghanistan Category:Languages of Iran Category:Languages of Pakistan
