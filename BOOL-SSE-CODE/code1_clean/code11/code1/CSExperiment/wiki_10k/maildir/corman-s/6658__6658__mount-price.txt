File:View towards Garibaldi Lake from Panorama Ridge (DSCF1842 - DSCF1844) (cropped).jpg '''Mount Price''' (sometimes '''Price Mountain''') is a volcano mountain in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt, in British Columbia, Canada. It is 2,049 meters (6,722 feet) tall. The mountain was formed 1.2 million years ago and is made of lava. It is not known to have been active in thousands of years, but it could be active again. If it did, it could cause problems for people who live nearby. There are teams that are prepared to help people if Mount Price becomes active. == Other websites == *[http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/volcanoes/cat/volcano_e.php?id=gvb_mpc_009 Mount Price information from Natural Resources Canada] Category:Volcanoes of British Columbia Category:Mountains of British Columbia
