The kingdom came into existence because of the Acts of Union 1707. These acts of parliament joined (Unification) the Kingdom of Scotland and the Kingdom of England. The kingdom's lands were Great Britain (an island in the Atlantic Ocean near Continental Europe) and some other islands in the British Isles. Throughout its existence, the kingdom was in a personal union (sharing the same monarchy) with the Kingdom of Ireland. Outside the British Isles, Great Britain governed other lands and started colonies: the British Empire. When the kingdom began, the Parliament of Scotland and the Parliament of England joined into one legislature, the Parliament of Great Britain. The parliament met in the old Palace of Westminster in London. London was the capital city and the British government was there. The two earlier kingdoms of Scotland and England had been in a personal union (sharing the same monarchy) since the reign of James VI and I. King James was a King of Scots who became King of England and King of Ireland in 1603 because he inherited the kingdoms of Elizabeth I. In 1801, by the Act of Union 1800, the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland joined into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland after the putting down of the Irish Rebellion of 1798. == Monarchs == Anne, Queen of Great Britain became Queen of England, Queen of Scotland, and Queen of Ireland in 1702. She became Queen of Great Britain when the new kingdom started in 1707. (Ireland was a separate kingdom, so Anne was Queen of Ireland and the later kings of Great Britain were each themselves King of Ireland.) From the start of 1801, during the reign of George III, the two kingdoms of Ireland and Great Britain became the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. === House of Stuart === * Anne of Great Britain (1707–1714) === House of Hanover === * George I of Great Britain (1714–1727) * George II of Great Britain (1727–1760) * George III of the United Kingdom (1760–1801), continued as King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland until 1820. ==Related pages== * British Armed Forces * Metropolitan Police ==References== {| class="wikitable" | width="30%" align="center" |''Preceded by:''Kingdom of Englandc 927–30 April 1707Kingdom of Scotlandc 843–30 April 1707 | width="40%" align="center" |'''United Kingdom of Great Britain'''1 May 1707 – 31 December 1800 | width="30%" align="center" |''Succeeded by:''United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland1 January 1801–5 December 1922 |} Category:1707 establishments Category:1800 disestablishments Category:Kingdom of Great Britain Category:1700s establishments in Europe Category:1800s disestablishments in Europe
