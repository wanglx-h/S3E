'''Apes''' are mammals belonging to the primate family '''Hominoidea'''. Its members are called '''hominoids'''. They are native to Africa and Southeast Asia. Its living members are divided into two Family (biology): *Hylobatidae, consisting of gibbons and siamangs. *Hominidae, consisting of orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, bonobos and humans.Groves, Colin; Wilson D.E. and Reeder D.M. (eds) 2005. ''Mammal species of the world''. 3rd ed, Johns Hopkins University Press. pp. 178-184. [http://www.departments.bucknell.edu/biology/resources/msw3/browse.asp?id=12100751] In everyday use, "ape" often refers only to hominoids other than humans. One clear difference between monkeys and apes is that monkeys almost always have tails, but hominoids never do. There are also differences in their tooth and the way they move their arms. They have a wide degree of freedom at the shoulder joint, which helps them swing by their arms in the trees (brachiation). The diets of apes are similar to those of other primates. They eat fruits, nuts, seeds, leaves and sometimes other animals. They are generally omnivores, though most of their intake is primarily herbivorous. File:Homininae.svg of the superfamily Hominoidea. It highlights the subfamily Homininae. First the gibbons (Hylobatidae) split from the main line some 18 million years ago. Next, the subfamily Ponginae broke away—leading to the current orangutan. Later the Homininae split into the tribe Hominini (with subtribes Hominina and Panina), and the tribe Gorillini]] ==References== ==Other websites== Category:Apes
