'''Helios''' (, ''Hēlios''; Ἠέλιος in Homeric Greek) is the Sun God in Greek mythology. He is often thought to be the personification of the Sun itself. He is the son of the Titan (mythology) Hyperion (titan) and Theia. He is the brother of Selene, goddess of the Moon, and Eos, goddess of the dawn. During the Hellenistic period, particularly the 3rd Century BCE, he became more and more identified with Apollo, the god of light, music and prophecy. Helios' equivalent in Roman mythology was Sol.
