'''Salford''' is a city in England. It was made a free borough by Ranulf, Earl of Chester in about 1230s. and was granted city status in 1926. Salford is unusual because it borders the city of Manchester at its center, rather than its outskirts. The two cities are divided by the River Irwell. Salford shares the industrial history of its neighbour Manchester. It hosts several museums and art centres, chiefly: [http://www.thelowry.com/ The Lowry] and the Imperial War Museum, both on Salford Quays. There was a major cotton and silk spinning and weaving factory district in the 18th and 19th centuries. It was an inland port on the Manchester Ship Canal from 1894. Broadcasters moved to the Salford Quays development called MediaCityUK. ==References== Category:Salford
