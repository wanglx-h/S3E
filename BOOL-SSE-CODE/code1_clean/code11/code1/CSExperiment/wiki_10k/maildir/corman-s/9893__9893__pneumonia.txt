The lung contains many small bulbs, or sacs, called alveolus. These help to take out oxygen from the air. In the case of pneumonia, these bulbs become inflammation. The lungs fill up with a fluid called pus and can no longer absorb as much oxygen as before. These make it hard for the person with pneumonia to breathing. They may feel out of breath, or like they are drowning. They may also feel pain when they breathe. Sometimes people die (30% of patients under 65) of pneumonia, even when they go to a hospital and take medicine (21% in-hospital Mortality rate rate all patients ages). ==Background== Most of the time, pneumonia is an Contagious disease that can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungus or parasites. It may be spread outside of hospitals which is called community-acquired pneumonia. It can also be spread in hospitals and similar health care facilities and this is called nosocomial pneumonia. It can also be caused by chemical or physical damage done to the lungs. Other illnesses, like alcohol abuse or lung cancer, can make it easier for a person to develop pneumonia. People with pneumonia usually have difficulty problems breathing. They may also cough, or have pain in the chest area. The treatment of pneumonia depends on how the illness was caused. If it was caused by bacteria or fungi, antibiotics can be used to treat it. People of all ages can have pneumonia. The disease is dangerous. Many people die from pneumonia, especially old people, or people or babies with a weak immune system. According to some research in 2010, in some parts of the world where people are very poor like India, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Guinea pneumonia was the cause of death for more children under the age of five than any other disease. Statistically, however, for every 2,000 children in the developing world who die of pneumonia, only one child in the developed world dies from the disease. This is because of differences in health care. == Treatment == Pneumonia can be treated with medications that target the specific source of the infection. This might be an antibiotic, an Antiviral drug, or an antifungal medication taken by mouth as a tablet or Intravenous therapy. Other therapies support a patient by providing comfort. These may include oxygen given by nose or mouth, inhalers to breathe in and expand the lungs, or steroids to decrease swelling. == Other types of pneumonia == File:PneumonisWedge09.JPG shows pneumonia; this one is caused by bacteria. In a healthy person, the lung should look black, but water in the lung makes it look white in an x-ray]] * '''Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)''' :SARS is a highly contagious and deadly type of pneumonia which first occurred in 2002 after initial outbreaks in China. SARS is caused by the SARS coronavirus, a pathogen (disease-causing organism) that was not known until then. New cases of SARS have not been seen since June 2003. * '''Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia''' ('''COP'''), formerly known as '''bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia''' ('''BOOP''') : an inflammation of the small airways of the lungs called the bronchioles (bronchiolitis) and other tissue in the lungs around them. It is a type (form) of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia. : It is often a complication of an existing chronic inflammatory disease such as rheumatoid arthritis, dermatomyositis, or it can be a side effect of certain medications such as amiodarone. COP was first described by Gary Epler in 1985. * '' '''Chemical pneumonia''' '' :Chemical pneumonia (usually called ''chemical pneumonitis'') is caused by chemical toxins such as pesticides, which may enter the body by inhalation (breathing in) or by skin contact. When the toxic (poisonous or harmful) substance is an oil, the pneumonia may be called ''lipoid pneumonia''. * '' '''Aspiration pneumonia''' '' :Aspiration pneumonia (or aspiration pneumonitis) is caused by accidentally inhaling oral (mouth) or gastric (stomach) contents into the lungs, either while eating, or after reflux or vomiting, and causing damage to the lungs. The lung inflammation from these materials is not an infection but it can eventually cause one, since the material taken into the lungs may contain bacteria. Aspiration is a common cause of death among hospital and nursing home patients, since they sometimes cannot cough hard enough to protect their airways. ==Related pages== *Severe acute respiratory syndrome ==References== == Other websites == * [http://www.merck.com/mrkshared/mmanual/section6/chapter73/73a.jsp Merck Manual: Pneumonia] * [http://www.merck.com/mrkshared/mmg/sec10/ch76/ch76a.jsp Merck Manual of Geriatrics: Pneumonia in the elderly] * [http://www.lunguk.org/pneumonia.asp?dis=23 British Lung Foundation] Category:Pneumonia
