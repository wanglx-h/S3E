Over the next few decades his followers, following the Great Commission, including the apostle Paul, carried his message throughout the Greek-speaking regions of Asia Minor, eventually introducing it to Rome itself. Roman rulers began to Persecution of Christians the new sect almost immediately (the emperor Nero accused the Christians of starting the Great Fire of Rome that destroyed much of Rome in 64 AD), and would continue to do so for centuries, sometimes vigorously, and other times passively.
