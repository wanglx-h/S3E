Subject: Baritone
A '''baritone''' is a man with a voice range between that of a tenor (high male voice) and bass (singer) (low male voice), typically ranging from the second F below middle C to the F above middle C. It is the most common male voice type. Famous baritone roles in opera include: Papageno in Mozart ''The Magic Flute'' and Figaro in Gioachino Rossini's ''The Barber of Seville''. Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau is often thought of as the greatest baritone of the later 20th century. He was famous as a Lieder singer as well as on the concert stage and in opera. Some musical instruments are also called "baritone" because they create similar frequencies to a baritone singer. Category:Vocal ranges he:קולות (מוזיקה)#בריטון
