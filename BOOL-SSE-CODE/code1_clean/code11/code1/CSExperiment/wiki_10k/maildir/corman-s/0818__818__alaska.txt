Seward, the 24th United States Secretary of State, negotiated the Alaska Purchase with the Russians in 1867 for $7.2 million. It was called Seward's Folly at the time. Russia's ruler then was Tsar Alexander II of Russia, the Emperor of the Russian Empire, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Finland. He also planned the sale.[https://www.adn.com/alaska-life/we-alaskans/2017/03/05/the-man-who-old-alaska/ The man who $old Alaska] – Anchorage Daily News The purchase was made on March 30, 1867. Six months later the commissioners arrived in Sitka and the formal transfer was arranged; the formal flag-raising took place at Fort Sitka on October 18, 1867. In the ceremony 250 uniformed U.S. soldiers marched to the governor's house at "Castle Hill", where the Russian troops lowered the Russian flag and the U.S. flag was raised.
