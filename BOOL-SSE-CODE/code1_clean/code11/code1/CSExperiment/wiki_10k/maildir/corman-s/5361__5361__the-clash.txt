The group was one of the most popular punk bands in England in the mid-1970s. == Music style == Although The Clash are known as an early punk rock band, they were willing to experiment with different styles, which they added to their music. Some of these styles were ska, reggae, and funk. Lyrics in their songs often dealt with political issues or stories in the news. ==Awards== In 2003, the band entered the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
