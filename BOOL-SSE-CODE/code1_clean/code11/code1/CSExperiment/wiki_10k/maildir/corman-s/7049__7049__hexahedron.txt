A '''hexahedron''' (plural: hexahedra) is any polyhedron with six Face (geometry). A cube, for example, is a Regular polyhedron hexahedron with all its faces Square (geometry), and three squares around each Vertex (geometry). There are seven topologically distinct ''convex'' hexahedra,[http://www.numericana.com/data/polycount.htm Counting polyhedra] one of which exists in two mirror image forms. (Two polyhedra are "topologically distinct" if they have intrinsically different arrangements of faces and vertices, such that it is impossible to distort one into the other simply by changing the lengths of edges or the angles between edges or faces.) {| class="wikitable" width=770 |- !colspan=7|Quadrilaterally-faced hexahedron (Cuboid) 6 faces, 12 edges, 8 vertices |- align=center |File:Hexahedron.png |File:Cuboid.png |File:Trigonal trapezohedron.png |File:Trigonal trapezohedron gyro-side.png |File:Usech kvadrat piramid.png |File:Parallelepiped 2013-11-29.svg |File:Rhombohedron.svg |- |Cube(Square (geometry)) |Cuboid(three pairs ofrectangles) |Trigonal trapezohedron(congruent rhombus) |Trigonal trapezohedron(congruent quadrilaterals) |Quadrilateral frustum(apex-truncatedsquare pyramid) |Parallelepiped(three pairs ofparallelograms) |(three pairs ofrhombus) |- !Oh, [4,3], (*432)order 48 !D2h, [2,2], (*222)order 8 !''D''3''d'', [2+,6], (2*3)order 12 !''D''3, [2,3]+, (223)order 6 !C4v, [4], (*44)order 8 !colspan=2|''C''''i'', [2+,2+], (×)order 2 |} {| class="wikitable" width=700 |+ Others |- align=center | File:Hexahedron5.svgTriangular bipyramid36 Faces9 E, 5 V | File:Hexahedron7.svgimage:Hexahedron7a.svg Tetragonal antiwedge.
