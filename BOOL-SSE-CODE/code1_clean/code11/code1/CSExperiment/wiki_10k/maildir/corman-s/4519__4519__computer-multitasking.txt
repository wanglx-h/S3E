'''Multitasking''' means that a computer can run more than one item of software in the same time frame; switching between several computer programs running on a single CPU. It can also refer to a person who is working on more than one task at the same time (for instance, talking on the telephone while filing papers). ==Computing== Computers rely on the Central Processing Unit to do tasks. CPUs with one core can only focus on one task at a time. Computer scientists fixed this by getting the CPU to rapidly switch between multiple tasks, an action known as multiprogramming. Multiprogramming happens so fast that the computer appears to be doing the tasks at the same time, even though its only ever working on one task. This is often controlled by the operating system (OS) controlling the hardware of the system. The more things the computer has to do at once, the more time it has to spend deciding which to give more time to, and the less time each one receives. This makes the computer perform its tasks more slowly. Due to this, most modern computers have multi-core processors. Each core can do a separate task without having to worry about the other cores. This is called multiprocessing. ==Related pages== * Multithreading * Multiprocessing Category:Computer science
