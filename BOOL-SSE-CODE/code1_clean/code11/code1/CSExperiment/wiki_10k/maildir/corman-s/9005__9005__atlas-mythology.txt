File:Atlas-GMC.jpg '''Atlas''' is a Titan (mythology) in Greek mythology. He is the son of Iapetus. He has seven daughters with the Oceanid Pleione. They are called the Pleiades (mythology). After the war between the Olympians and the Titans, Atlas was punished. Zeus forced him to hold the heaven on the western edge of the world. Later, the story about him changed and it was said that he held the whole world on his shoulders. Mostly in modern times, he is shown holding a globe of the world. Heracles came to Atlas and asked him to for help with one of his Labours of Hercules. He wanted Atlas to get the "Golden Apples" for him as only an immortal could take them. Atlas agreed, but only if Heracles would hold up the sky. Atlas was pleased to be free from its weight but Heracles tricked him into holding it again. After Perseus killed Medusa he asked the king Atlas of Mauretania to host him but the latter refused, Perseus in revenge decided to show him the head of Medusa by petrifying him and ran away. Atlas was turned into a mountain called, "[The] Atlas Mountains." Category:Titans
