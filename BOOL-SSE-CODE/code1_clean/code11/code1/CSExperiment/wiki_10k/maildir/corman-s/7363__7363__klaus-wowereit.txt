He came out at a convention of the Berlin SPD just before the 2001 mayoral elections, when he said "" ("I am gay, and it's good that way".) This is now a famous quotation in Germany.

Bertrand Delanoë, the mayor of Paris, is openly gay, and Ole von Beust, the former mayor of Hamburg, is also gay.While Beust's father has confirmed his son's homosexuality in an interview, Beust himself considers his sexual orientation a private matter and when asked directly usually irony refers the questioner to his father.
