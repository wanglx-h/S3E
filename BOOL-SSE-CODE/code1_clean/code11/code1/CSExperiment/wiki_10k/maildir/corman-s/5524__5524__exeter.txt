It is the county town of Devon. Around 130,000 people live there. In the city are a ruined castle, much of the old Roman Britain city wall, and Exeter Cathedral. ==History== Exeter was built by the Romans, who called it ''Isca Dumnoniorum'' (Isca of the Dumnonii, the local British tribe). After the Romans left and the Anglo-Saxons moved into the area in the seventh century, the name changed to Exeter. In the 1060s, Exeter was a centre of rebellion to the Norman conquest. In 1050, the Bishop of Crediton moved to Exeter; from then until 1876 the bishops were the heads of the Church of England in the whole of Devon and Cornwall. Now, only Devon is within the Exeter diocese. ==Today== Today it is home to the Met Office, which forecasts the country's weather. == References == Category:Exeter
