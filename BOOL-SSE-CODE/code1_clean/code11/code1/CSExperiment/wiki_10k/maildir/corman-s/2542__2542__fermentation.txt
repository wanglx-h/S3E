'Fermentation' also describes growing microorganisms on a growth medium. This is done to get a chemical product. French microbiologist Louis Pasteur studied fermentation and its microbial causes. The science of fermentation is known as ''zymology''. Yeast is an organism that ferments. When yeast ferments sugar, the yeast uses sugar and produces Ethanol. The process uses the coenzyme Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide: In metabolism, NAD helps redox reactions, carrying electrons from one reaction to another. Fermentation is a less efficient form of respiration than oxidative respiration (respiration using oxygen). The ethyl alcohol produced by yeast is used to make beverages or biofuel. Yeast can be also used to grow bakery products like bread and cakes faster. In some cases yeast might be used to speed up the process of creation of wine. Other cells make vinegar or lactic acid when they ferment sugar. In a different way, the fermentation process can continue and turn the alcohol into vinegar i.e. acetic acid. == Types of fermentation == When yeast ferments, it breaks down the glucose (C6H12O6) into ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and carbon dioxide (CO2). * Ethanol fermentation always produces ethanol and carbon dioxide. It is important in bread-making, brewing, and wine-making. * Lactic acid fermentation produces lactic acid. It happens in muscles of animals when they need lots of energy fast. The pain of a cramped muscle is caused by the build-up of lactic acid. The pain eases as the product is taken away by the blood supply. == Other websites == * [http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/Fermentation_(biochemistry) Fermentation (biochemistry)] -Citizendium == References == Category:Fermented drinks Category:Fermentation
