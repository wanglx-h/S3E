| last_aired = | num_episodes = List of Seinfeld episodes (including two-part episodes) }} '''''Seinfeld''''' is an United States situation comedy television programme created by Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David, and ran from 1989 to 1998. The show is about four friends in New York City living their day-to-day lives. This show follows a strict policy of "no hugging, no learning" which means the episodes do not end with characters learning a lesson or feature any dramatic scenes such as fighting, arguing, or crying which is why the series is joked about being the "show about nothing". == People == === Main Characters === * Jerry Seinfeld (played by Jerry Seinfeld) - The main protagonist of the show.
