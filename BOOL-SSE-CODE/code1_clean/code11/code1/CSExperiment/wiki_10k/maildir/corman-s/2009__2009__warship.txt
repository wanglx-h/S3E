Here is a list of different kinds of warships, from the largest to the smallest of World War II: {| class=wikitable |- !Type!!WeightApproximate weight in tons!!Weapons and notes |- |Battleship||35,000|| 12inch to 18" naval artillery guns |- |Aircraft carrier||27,000||Fully loaded with airplane, an aircraft carrier weighed over 36,000 ton. |- |Battle cruiser||25,000||10" to 12" guns |- |Cruiser||10,000||Heavy cruiser had 8" guns or largerLight cruiser had less than 8" guns. |- |Destroyer||2,000||4" to 6" guns. |- |Frigate||1,500||3" to 5" guns |- |Submarine||1,500||torpedoes |- |colspan=3| |} == Modern warships == It is a principle of modern navies that ''larger ships never travel alone''. They are too vulnerable to planes, submarines and missiles. An aircraft carrier will have an :en:Airborne_early_warning_and_control plane above to give wider radar warning, destroyers and submarines deployed around. This is recognised by the term "Carrier Strike Group". This is a U.S. term, but the principle applies to all large navies.Gibson, Chris 2011.

Hinckley, England: Midland Publishing. ISBN 978-1857802153 Modern warships come in the same "class" of ship as they did in World War II, but the sizes are different. From largest to smallest: * Aircraft carriers are airports at sea. They are often called "floating cities" because they can hold hundreds of planes, and thousands of sailors. United States USS Nimitz carriers can Displacement (ship) over 100,000 ton. ** Escort carriers are smaller aircraft carriers. They have fewer planes and sailors, but are usually faster. ** Helicopter carriers are used by the United States Marine Corps and some navies such as Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force. * Battleships are not used anymore. This is because they are expensive to operate and not safe from enemy air attacks. Smaller battleships may be called battle cruisers. Battle cruisers have less armor and guns than a battleship, but are faster. * Cruisers and frigates are often now the same size. They are mainly used to launch guided missiles or to shoot down enemy airplanes. Cruisers are usually slower and larger and have longer range than frigates. Most cruisers and frigates are large enough to operate helicopters on the back of the ship. This part is called the fantail. Cruisers can usually hold one or two. Although they are smaller, some frigates are designed to hold two or three. * Destroyers are smaller and faster than cruisers and frigates. They are usually used to hunt down enemy submarines. Sometimes, they will also attack enemy airplanes. They can also go closer to shore than larger ships. This allows them to attack things on land. * Submarines can hide under the water. Modern large submarines are powered by nuclear reactors and can go round the world underwater. Some provide a "nuclear deterrent". == Other uses == Support warships are used to supply ammunition, food, and other supplies to the larger warships. Some warships exist to carry powerful radio receivers and computers to detect and analyze transmissions from nearby ships. Usually these kinds of ships are smaller, and do not have many guns or missiles themselves. == References == Category:Warships Category:Ship types
