But in the last two movies, Episodes II and III, Yoda is made with Computer-generated imagery. == History == Yoda has lived for over 900 years and not much of his history before ''Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace'' is known. He is an extraterrestrial life, but his species and where he is from are never said. He speaks the same language as everyone else but says his sentences sort of backwards. For example, "Teach you, I will" instead of "I will teach you". Yoda is the oldest and wisest member of the Jedi Council. Even though he is very small, he is very good with a lightsaber and uses the 4th jedi style known as Ataru. == Other websites == * [http://www.vegetarianfriends.net/issue13.html#3 Article by Urrutia: "Interview with Master Yoda."] * wikiasite:starwars:Yoda on Wookiepedia Category:Fictional characters introduced in 1980 Category:Star Wars characters
