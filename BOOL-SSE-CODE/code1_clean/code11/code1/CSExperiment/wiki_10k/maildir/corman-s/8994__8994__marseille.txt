About 1.7 million people live in the metropolitan area, and about 850,000 in the city itself. This makes it the second largest city in France by number of people. Its commercial port is the biggest in France and one of the most important in the Mediterranean sea. Although part of the region of Provence, Marseilles has its own history. This city is the oldest in France and probably the most complex. The city was started around 600 BC by Ancient Greece sailors from Phocaea (modern day Foça, near İzmir). This was a Greek colony in Asia Minor that is in what is now Turkey. Marseille has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (''Csa'' in the Koeppen climate classification). == Education == * École pour l'informatique et les nouvelles technologies * Institut Polytechnique des Sciences Avancées * Kedge Business School See also Transport in Marseille ==References== Category:Marseille
