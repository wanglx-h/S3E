They began in 1972 in the city of Atlanta, and moved to Calgary in 1980. They won the Stanley Cup in 1989. They also made the Stanley Cup finals in 1986, losing to the Montreal Canadiens, and in 2004, losing to the Tampa Bay Lightning four games to three. The Flames won the Presidents' Trophy as regular season champion in 1988 and 1989. The Flames play in the Scotiabank Saddledome in Calgary, Alberta, Alberta, Canada. It is called the "Saddledome" because the roof is shaped like a saddle. Some of the best players to play for the Flames include Al MacInnis, who won the Conn Smythe Trophy as most valuable player in the playoffs in 1989; Jarome Iginla, who won the Art Ross Trophy as top point scorer in 2001-02, as well as the Rocket Richard Trophy as top goal scorer in 2001-02 and 2003-04; Lanny MacDonald, who scored 500 career goals, mostly in Calgary; Gary Suter, who won the Calder Trophy as "rookie of the year" in 1985-86 and captained the team to their only Stanley Cup win; goaltender Mike Vernon; and forwards Joe Mullen, Joe Nieuwendyk, and Theoren Fleury. ==References== ==Other websites== *[http://flames.nhl.com/ Official website] Category:Calgary Flames
