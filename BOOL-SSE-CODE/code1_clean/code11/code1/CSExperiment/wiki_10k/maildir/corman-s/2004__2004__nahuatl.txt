The first people to speak Nahuatl were indigenous peoples in central Mexico. The Aztecs and the Toltecs spoke an early form of Nahuatl. The people of Teotihuacan may have spoken Nahuatl. Nahuatl has changed since the end of the Aztec Empire. Over time, many different dialects of Nahuatl have developed. Today, people who speak different dialects do not always understand one another. The words "Mexico," "Guatemala," and "Nicaragua" all come from Nahuatl. == Today == Today, most people who speak Nahuatl live in central Mexico, but a few live in other parts of Mexico or in the United States. Nahuatl is one of the official languages of Mexico. However, most people who speak it now also speak Spanish language. Many phrases that are unique to Mexican Spanish come from Nahuatl, according to the American Linguistics John Lipski. Those unique phrases are called "Mexicanisms." An example is ''ándale, ''which often means "let's go." Another example is the word ''Bueno?'' and is used by many Spanish-speakers when they answer the telephone. == Nahuatl words in English == Here are some English language words of Nahuatl origin: * avocado * axolotl * cacao and cocoa * chili pepper * chocolate * coyote * ocelot * peyote * sapote * tequila * tomato ==Related pages== * Miguel León-Portilla ==Notes== ==References== Category:Nahuatl language
