[https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&pg=PA878&dq= "Shogun"] in ''Japan Encyclopedia'', pp. 878-879. Shogun means ''general'' in the Japanese language. The full name was ''Seii Taishogun'' (Great General who fights against the Eastern savages and will win). In the earlier times, Shogun were simply generals for emperors. The Emperor of Japan had power over the shogun, choosing each shogun. Later however, the Shogun held much of the actual power. In 1192 a samurai, military leader Minamoto no Yoritomo got the title of Shogun from the last Emperor Emperor Go-Shirakawa of Japan. Excluding the later middle of the 16th century, Shogun was the real ruler of Japan. The office of the Shogun is called the shogunate (''bakufu'', meaning ''office in a tent'').- This is because Shogun had originally been military leaders and he had his office in a tent on a battle field. There were three shogunates in Japan. * Kamakura shogunate,Nussbaum, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&pg=PA459&dq= "''Kamakura-jidai''"] at pp. 459. 11921333, founded by Minamoto no Yoritomo * Muromachi shogunateNussbaum, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&pg=PA669&dq= "''Muromachi-jidai''"] at pp. 669.
