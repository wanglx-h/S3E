File:Stockwhip 2.jpg A '''whip''' is a long strand of leather or other fabric with a hard handle. When a person shakes a whip fast, it makes a loud "crack" sound, because it has broken the sound barrier because flicking a whip causes a loop that gets faster and faster across the whip. It is used for directing or hitting animals or people. Some whips are made for corporal punishment or flogging.
