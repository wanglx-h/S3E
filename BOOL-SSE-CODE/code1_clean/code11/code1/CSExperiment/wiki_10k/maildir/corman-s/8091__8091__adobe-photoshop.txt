}} '''Photoshop''' is a popular image changing software package. It is widely used by photography for photo editing (fixing colors, reducing noise, adding effects, fixing brightness/contrast) and by graphic designers and Web designers to create and change images for web pages. The first version was introduced in 1990. Version Photoshop CC 2018 was launched on October 18 2017. Photoshop works on computer systems like Microsoft Windows and Mac OS. The software is made by the company Adobe Systems. A simpler version named Photoshop Elements is made for home users who do not want to buy the more powerful, more expensive full version. Photoshop Express, a free version, is even more limited. There are different pricing plans for the application.
