File:Asashoryu fight Jan08.JPG is a Japanese full-contact sport.Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&pg=PA914 "''Sumo''"] in ''Japan Encyclopedia'', p. 914. In sumo, a wrestler (''rikishi'') attempts to force another wrestler out of a circular ring (the ''dohyō'') 4.55metres in diameter. Also, the ''rikishi'' try to use their skill to force an opponent to touch the ground with anything other than the soles of his feet. Sumo tournaments (''basho'') take place in Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Japan and Fukuoka. There are a total of 6 major professional tournaments (known as ''honbasho'') per year, in January, March, May, July, September and November. A tournament normally lasts for 15 days and features matches from different divisions. The top 5 ranks are known as the "Top division", also called the ''Makuuchi'' (幕内) or ''Makunouchi'' (幕の内). It is fixed in size and always contains 42 ''rikishi''. The ranks included in the top division are Yokozuna (sumo), ozeki, sekiwake, komusubi and maegashira. ==Rikishi== Sumo wrestlers (''rikishi'') are ranked into a hierarchy based on win-loss statistics in competitive tournaments.Nussbaum, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&pg=PA914 "''Sumotori''"] in ''Japan Encyclopedia'', pp. 914-915. ===Grand champions=== Those who have earned the highest rank are grand champions (''yokuzuna'').Nussbaum, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&pg=PA915 "Yokozuna (Sumo Grand Champions)"] at p. 915; retrieved 2012-2-27. * Akashi, 16th century * Maruyama, (1712-1749) * Tanikaze (Kajinosuke, 1750-1795) * Onagawa (1758-1805) * Ao no Matsu (1791-1851) :... * Chiyonofuji Mitsugu (born 1955)Nussbaum, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&pg=PA117 "Chiyonofugi"] at p. 117; retrieved 2012-2-27. * Takanosato (born 1952) * Futahaguro Koji (born 1963) * Hokuto-umi, (born 1963) * Onokuni (born 1962) * Asahifuji (born 1960) * Akebono Tarō (born 1970) For a full list of those rikishi who have held the title of ''Yokozuna'', see List of yokozuna. ===Foreign-born competitors=== Sumo has changed in modern times. Foreign-born wrestlers are part of the sport. For example, Konishiki YasokichiSumo Reference, [http://sumodb.sumogames.com/Rikishi.aspx?r=1287 Konishiki Yasokichi] ; retrieved 2012-2-27. and AkebonoJapan Sumo Association, [http://sumo.goo.ne.jp/eng/ozumo_meikan/rikishi_joho/rikishi_35.html "Akebono"] ; retrieved 2012-2-27. are Hawaiian-born athletes who earned places for themselves. In 2008, Kotooshu from Bulgaria won a championship. In that same year, two top wrestlers, Asashoryu and Hakuho, were Mongolian people. Hakuho won the Nagoya tournament with no losses, 15-0. ==References== Category:Sport in Japan Category:Wrestling
