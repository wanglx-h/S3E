A '''crater''' is a round dent on a planet. They are usually shaped like a circle or an oval. They are usually made by something like a meteor hitting the surface of a planet. Underground activity such as volcanoes or explosions can also cause them but it's not as likely. ==Related pages== *Volcanic crater *Caldera *Impact crater == References == Category:Craters
