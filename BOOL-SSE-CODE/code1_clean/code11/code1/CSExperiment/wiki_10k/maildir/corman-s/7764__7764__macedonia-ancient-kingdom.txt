File:MacedonEmpire.jpg '''Macedonia''' (Greek: Μακεδονία) or '''Macedon''' was an Ancient Greek Monarchy of the Archaic Greece and Classical Greece,. and later the most powerful state of Hellenistic Greece.. The kingdom was established and was at first ruled by the royal Argead dynasty, which was followed by the Antipatrid dynasty and Antigonid dynasty dynasties. Home to the ancient Macedonians, the earliest kingdom was centered on the northeastern part of the Greek peninsula,. and bordered by Epirus to the west, Paeonia to the north, Thrace to the east and Thessaly to the south. Alexander the Great made it the most powerful kingdom in the Near East for a few years. When he died the empire fell apart and the Antigonid dynasty ruled Macedonia as a small empire. Centuries later the Roman Empire conquered Macedonia and much of Alexander's empire. == Kings == === Argead dynasty === * Karanus of Macedon 808-778 BC * Koinos of Macedon * Tyrimmas of Macedon * Perdiccas I of Macedon 700-678 BC * Argaeus I of Macedon 678-640 BC * Philip I of Macedon 640-602 BC * Aeropus I of Macedon 602-576 BC * Alcetas I of Macedon 576-547 BC * Amyntas I of Macedon 547-498 BC * Alexander I of Macedon 498-454 BC * Perdiccas II of Macedon 454-413 BC * Archelaus I of Macedon 413-399 BC * Craterus of Macedon 399 BC * Orestes of Macedon 399-396 BC * Archelaus II of Macedon 396-393 BC * Amyntas II of Macedon 393 BC * Pausanias of Macedon 393 BC * Amyntas III of Macedon 393 BC * Argaeus II of Macedon 393-392 BC * Amyntas III of Macedon (restored) 392-370 BC * Alexander II of Macedon 370-368 BC * Ptolemy I of Macedon 368-365 BC * Perdiccas III of Macedon 365-359 BC * Amyntas IV of Macedon 359-356 BC * Philip II of Macedon 359-336 BC * Alexander the Great 336-323 BC ** Antipater, Regent of Macedon 334-319 BC * Philip III of Macedon 323-317 BC * Alexander IV of Macedon 323-310 BC ** Perdiccas, Regent of Macedon 323-321 BC ** Antipater, Regent of Macedon 321-319 BC ** Polyperchon, Regent of Macedon 319-317 BC ** Cassander, Regent of Macedon 317-306 BC === Antipatrid dynasty === * Cassander 306-297 BC * Philip IV of Macedon 297-296 BC * Alexander V of Macedon 296-294 BC * Antipater II of Macedon 296-294 BC === Antigonid dynasty === * Demetrius I Poliorcetes 294-288 BC * Lysimachus (divided with Pyrrhus of Epirus) 288-281 BC * Pyrrhus of Epirus (divided with Lysimachus) 288-285 BC * Ptolemy Ceraunus 281-279 BC * Meleager (king) 279 BC * Antipater II of Macedon 279 BC * Sosthenes of Macedon (Army Commander) 279-277 BC * Antigonus II Gonatas 277-274 BC * Pyrrhus of Epirus (restored) 274-272 BC * Antigonus II Gonatas (restored) 272-239 BC * Demetrius II of Macedon 239-229 BC * Antigonus III of Macedon 229-221 BC * Philip V of Macedon 221-179 BC * Perseus of Macedon 179-168 BC * == References == == Books == * Eugene N.
