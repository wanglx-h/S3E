'''Sicily'''[[#Notes|[p]]] is the largest island in the Mediterranean. Along with some smaller islands it is an autonomous region of Italy. The capital city of Sicily is Palermo. The population was about 5,087,000 (over 5 million) in 2004. Sicily is the biggest region in the nation of Italy. Phoenicia and Ancient Greece people colonized the island in the 8th Century BC and sometimes fought wars there. Carthage controlled most of the island until Ancient Rome conquered it. In later centuries, Saracen (who significantly impacted the Island genetically and culturally) fought against the Byzantine Greeks, and Normans ruled it for a few centuries. A German dynasty and a French one ruled in the 13th century. After the 1282 revolts of Sicilian Vespers, the crown of Aragon and Spain took over the Island. Later, Giuseppe Garibaldi in the Risorgimento conquered it and brought it into the Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946). == Provinces == * Province of Agrigento * Province of Caltanissetta * Province of Catania * Province of Enna * Province of Messina * Province of Palermo * Province of Ragusa * Province of Syracuse * Province of Trapani == Notes == : [p] - The word "Sicily" is pronounced as "SISS-uh-lee". == Other websites == * [http://www.regione.sicilia.it/ Official Site of Regions Sicily (Italian site)] * [http://www.lasiciliainrete.it/ La Sicilia In Rete] Category:Islands of Italy Category:Sicily Category:Autonomous areas
