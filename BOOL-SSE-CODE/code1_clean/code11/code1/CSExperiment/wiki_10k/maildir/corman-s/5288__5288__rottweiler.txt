Their coat (dog) of fur is mostly black, with brown on the legs and face. They are excellent guard dogs, as well as herding, and companion dogs. == History == The Rottweiler is one of the oldest of herding breeds.Manfred Schanzle, ''Studies in The Breed History of The Rottweiler''. DVM thesis, University of Munich, 1969. With a history possibly dating back to the Roman Empire, the Rottweiler may be a descendant of ancient Roman drover dogs; a mastiff-type dog that was a dependable, rugged dog with great intelligence and guarding instincts. == Behaviour == Dogs are Pack hunters. When they feel wikt:threatened, they will wikt:defend themselves. They will also wikt:protect other members of the wikt:pack to a certain extent. How they defend themselves, and how close they feel to the rest of the pack (their owners) depends on the dog's wikt:nature. It also depends on how they were wikt:raised. Since dogs judge wikt:dangerous wikt:situations differently, they should not be left unattended near a place where people are arguing. They may also judge ''unwikt:attended'' moves of a child as an attack. Therefore, dogs should not be left alone near children. == Size == There is no specific weight for a Rottweiler to qualify to be judged in dog shows. The dog must be neither too thin or too fat for its size. Both males and females must be "medium-large" in size for the American Kennel Club. The General German Rottweiler Club (ADRK) lists 50 kilograms (110 pounds) for males and 42 kilograms (93 pounds) for females . == Considerations == When the Rottweilers' owners are not experienced, problems arise. Sometimes humans, mostly children, are attacked by these dogs. The attacks are often a result of irresponsible owners. Rottweilers are very intelligent and need equally smart handlers to raise them. In some areas, breeding certain dogs has been restricted or forbidden. == References == ==Further reading== * Blackmore, Joan. A Dog Owners Guide to the Rottweiler * Brace, Andrew H.
