File:Seal of the United States National Guard.svg The '''United States National Guard''' is an organization of the United States Army and the United States Air Force. Both the Army and the Air Force are branches of the Military of the United States. The National Guard is a militia (an emergency army) for the United States. Each U.S. state has its own National Guard, usually under the control of the state's government. When needed, it is mobilized under control of the United States. There are two parts of the United States National Guard, which are administered by the National Guard Bureau of the United States Department of Defense. The Air National Guard is part of the United States Air Force, and the Army National Guard is part of the United States Army. Both groups are identified by the kinds of jobs they do. The Air National Guard is mainly for Anti-aircraft warfare, and the Army National Guard is on the ground. ==Related pages== * United States Army Reserve * [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States) National Guard (United States)] Category:United States Army
