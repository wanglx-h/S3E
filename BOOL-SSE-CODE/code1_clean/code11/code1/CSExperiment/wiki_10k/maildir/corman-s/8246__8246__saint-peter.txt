He is often talked about in the New Testament of the Bible across the different Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke and John). ==Overview== Most of what we know about Peter comes from the Bible. In the Gospel it is written that Jesus Christ would make Peter the "rock" (foundation) of the Church (Gospel of Matthew 16:18, ''you are Peter (rock), and upon this rock I will build my church''). It is not known when Peter was born, but the date of his death is said to be about the year 64 AD. He died by being nailed to a cross in Rome, the modern Capital city of Italy. This type of death is called crucifixion. According to the apocrypha's ''Acts of Peter'', Peter asked to be crucified upside down, as he felt unworthy to die as Jesus did. Most historical sources only say that he was crucified this way. ==Historicity== The historical accuracy of the accounts of Peter's role in Rome is a matter of ongoing debate. * Ehrman, Bart D.: ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=WsQpdzzC7oMC Peter, Paul, And Mary Magdalene: The Followers of Jesus in History And Legend]'', Chapter 6, Oxford University Press US, 2006, * Keating, Karl: ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=FlWAI0JeRcsC Catholicism and fundamentalism: The attack on "romanism" by "Bible Christians"]'', Chapter 17, Ignatius Press, 1988, * Perkins, Pheme: ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=sre1Itvw4SIC Peter: Apostle for the Whole Church]'', Continuum International Publishing Group, 2000, Painting from Millennium often show him holding the keys to the Kingdom of God – a reference to Gospel of Matthew . Peter was Marriage according to the Gospel of Mark. The name of his wife is unknown. ==Saint and Pope== The Roman Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodoxy, and Lutheranism Churches, as well as the Anglican Communion, consider Simon Peter a saint. Roman Catholics believe that the Pope is Peter's successor. For this reason, he is the rightful head of all other bishops. Eastern and Oriental Orthodox also recognise the Bishop of Rome as the successor to Saint Peter and the Ecumenical Patriarch sends a delegation each year to Rome to participate in the celebration of his feast. ===''Ravenna document''=== In the ''Ravenna document'' of 13 October 2007, representatives of the Eastern Orthodox Church agreed that They disagree, however, on the interpretation of historical evidence from this era regarding the rights of the bishop of Rome as ''protos'', a matter that was already understood in different ways in the first millennium.}} Christian tradition says Saint Peter was the first leader of an early apostolic community for at least 34 years. Back then, the word Pope or "Papa" was not used to name the leader of the Roman Catholic Church. At that time there was only one Christian Church. Later, the Roman Catholic Church would say that Peter was their first Pope.[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12272b.htm "List of Popes,"] ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (2009); retrieved 2013-4-1. Tradition also locates his burial place where St. Peter's Basilica was later built, in Vatican City. ==Related pages== * Twelve Apostles ==Footnotes== ==References== Category:Popes Category:67 deaths Category:Twelve Apostles Category:Early Christian saints Category:Deans of the College of Cardinals
