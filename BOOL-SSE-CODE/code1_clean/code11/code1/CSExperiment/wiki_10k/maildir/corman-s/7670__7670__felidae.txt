Animals that belong to Felidae are called ''felids''. The cat family is of quite recent origin: the first fossils are from the Oligocene, 25 million years ago (mya). There are 41 living species, including the domestic cat, and they are monophyletic: all descended from the same ancestor. == Characteristics == Felids tend to have lithe and flexible bodies with muscular limbs. In most species, the tail is a third or a half the length of the body, with some exceptions (the bobcat and margay). The limbs are digitigrade, meaning they walk on their toes. The paws have three soft toe pads and retractible claws (usually). The tongue of felids is covered with horny Filiform papilla, which rasp meat from prey and aid in grooming. == Classification == File:Purring_and_meowing.ogg File:Lion raring-sound1TamilNadu178.ogg The Felidae has three subfamilies: * †Machairodontinae: sabre-toothed cats. * Pantherinae: large cats tiger, lion, jaguar, leopard * Felinae: cougar, cheetah and smaller cats More examples of felines are the big cats – the lion, tiger, leopard, jaguar, snow leopard, clouded leopard, puma, and cheetah - and other wild cats, for example the lynx, caracal, and bobcat. All felines, also the small pet cat, are predators that can hunt many animals. ==Evolution== The felids evolved in Asia and spread across continents by crossing land bridges. DNA sequence analysis shows that ancient cats evolved into eight main lines. There were at least 10 migrations (in both directions) from continent to continent via the Bering land bridge and Isthmus of Panama. The ''Panthera'' genus is the oldest and the ''Felis'' genus is the youngest. 60 percent of the modern species of cats developed within the last million years. The felids' closest relatives are the Prionodons,Eizirik E. ''et al'' 2010. Pattern and timing of the diversification of the mammalian order Carnivora inferred from multiple nuclear gene sequences. ''Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution'' '''56''': 49-63. doi:10.1016/j.ympev.2010.01.033 and at one remove the group of civets, hyenas, mongooses, and Eupleridae,Gaubert P. & Veron G. 2003. Exhaustive sample set among Viverridae reveals the sister-group of felids: the linsangs as a case of extreme morphological convergence within Feliformia. ''Proceedings of the Royal Society, Series B'' '''270''' (1532): 2523–30. doi:10.1098/rspb.2003.2521 with whom they share the Suborder Feliformia. All felid species share a genetic anomaly that prevents them from tasting sweetness. ===Genetic classification=== Genetic research has provided a basis for a more concise classification for the living members of the cat family based on genotypical groupings. Specifically, eight genetic lineages have been identified: * Lineage 1: ''Panthera'', ''Snow Leopard'', ''Neofelis'' * Lineage 2: ''Pardofelis'', ''Catopuma'' * Lineage 3: ''Leptailurus'', ''Caracal'', ''Profelis'' * Lineage 4: ''Leopardus'' * Lineage 5: ''Lynx'' * Lineage 6: ''Puma (genus)'', ''Acinonyx'' * Lineage 7: ''Prionailurus'', ''Otocolobus'' * Lineage 8: ''Felis'' The last four lineages (5, 6, 7, 8) are more related to each other than to any of the first four (1, 2, 3, 4), and so form a clade within the Felinae subfamily of family Felidae. ==Taxonomy== * '''Subfamily Felinae''' ** Genus ''Acinonyx'' *** Cheetah, ''Acinonyx jubatus'' ** Genus ''Caracal'' *** Caracal, ''Caracal caracal'' ** Genus ''Catopuma'' *** Bay cat, ''Catopuma badia'' *** Asian golden cat, ''Catopuma temminckii'' ** Genus ''Felis'' *** Chinese mountain cat, ''Felis bieti'' *** Jungle cat, ''Felis chaus'' *** Pallas' cat / Manul, ''Felis manul'' *** Sand cat, ''Felis margarita'' *** Black-footed cat, ''Felis nigripes'' *** Wildcat, ''Felis silvestris'' **** Cat, ''Felis silvestris catus'' ** Genus ''Leopardus'' *** Pantanal cat, ''Leopardus braccatus'' *** Colocolo, ''Leopardus colocolo'' *** Pampas cat, ''Leopardus pajeros'' *** Geoffroy's cat, ''Leopardus geoffroyi'' *** Kodkod, ''Leopardus guigna'' *** Andean mountain cat, ''Leopardus jacobitus'' *** Ocelot, ''Leopardus pardalis'' *** Oncilla, ''Leopardus tigrinus'' *** Margay, ''Leopardus wiedii'' ** Genus ''Leptailurus'' *** Serval, ''Leptailurus serval'' ** Genus ''Lynx'' *** Canada lynx, ''Lynx canadensis'' *** Eurasian lynx, ''Lynx lynx'' *** Iberian lynx, ''Lynx pardinus'' *** Bobcat, ''Lynx rufus'' ** Genus ''Pardofelis'' *** Marbled cat, ''Pardofelis marmorata'' ** Genus ''Prionailurus'' *** Leopard cat, ''Prionailurus bengalensis'' *** Iriomote cat, ''Prionailurus iriomotensis'' *** Flat-headed cat, ''Prionailurus planiceps'' *** Rusty-spotted cat, ''Prionailurus rubiginosus'' *** Fishing cat, ''Prionailurus viverrinus'' ** Genus ''Profelis'' *** African golden cat, ''Profelis aurata'' ** Genus ''Puma'' *** Puma, ''Puma concolor'' * '''Subfamily Pantherinae''' ** Genus ''Neofelis'' *** Clouded leopard, ''Neofelis nebulosa'' *** Clouded leopard#Sunda clouded leopard, ''Neofelis diardi'' ** Genus ''Panthera'' *** Lion, ''Panthera leo'' *** Jaguar, ''Panthera onca'' *** Leopard, ''Panthera pardus'' *** Tiger, ''Panthera tigris'' ** Genus ''Uncia'' *** Snow leopard, ''Uncia uncia'' ==Related pages== * ''Smilodon'' ==References== Category:Felines
