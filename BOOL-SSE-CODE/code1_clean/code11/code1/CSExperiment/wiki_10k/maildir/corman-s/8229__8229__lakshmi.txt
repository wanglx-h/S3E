Most Hindus pray to her on Diwali, which is a festival in India. She is regarded as an equivalent goddess of Emoinu, her Meitei counterpart. Lakshmi has four arms, fair skin and sits on a Nelumbo flower and is normally surrounded by elephants. She is covered in jewellery. She also has several avatars (means a god coming to the earth in the form of a human being or in any other form). Her husband is the Hindu Deity Vishnu but her other avatars are usually married to Vishnu's avatars: * Sita, wife of Rama * Radha, the eternal wife and chief consort of Krishna * Rukmini, the principal wife and first queen consort of Krishna ==Related pages== * Hindu Goddess == Further reading == * * == References == == Other websites == * [https://www.odishashop.com/product-category/books-literature/odia-spiritual/ Maha Lakshmi Purana] *[http://alaivani.com/Blog/tabid/56/EntryID/47/Default.aspx 108 Aspects of Wealth] * [http://www.mahalakshmimandir.com The Online mandir of Mahalakshmi] * [http://www.divyadesamonline.com/hindu-deities/sri-lakshmi.asp Know about Goddess Sri Lakshmi] * [http://www.stutimandal.com/poems_lakshmi.htm Hymns and eulogies on Lakshmi] * [http://www.odia.org Lakshmi Puran] Category:Hindu gods and goddesses Category:Hindu goddesses
