A '''raven''' is a big black bird, (''Corvus corax''). It is also called the common raven or the northern raven. It is similar to a crow, but bigger. It and the thick-billed raven are the two largest birds in the corvidae, and perhaps the heaviest perching birds. The raven's feathers are all black, but a crow has feathers that are white at the bottom. This cannot be seen from a distance. The most famous raven is in the Edgar Allan Poe story called ''The Raven''. The common raven can be wikt:tame. Some think it is mischievous and sly, and it has been regarded as a bird of evil and wikt:mysterious character. == References == File:Corvus corax tingitanus MHNT 232 HdB Djebel Messaad Algerie.jpg Category:Corvids Category:National symbols of Bhutan
