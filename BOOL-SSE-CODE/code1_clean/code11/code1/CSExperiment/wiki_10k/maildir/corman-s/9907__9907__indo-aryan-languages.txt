They are mostly spoken in North India, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, the Maldives and Bangladesh. However, some are also spoken in other places, such as Europe. The Indo-Aryan languages come from a common ancestor, Proto-Indo-Aryan, and today include many modern languages like Sindhi Marathi, Odia, Hindustani (Hindi and Urdu), Romani language, Domari language, Lomavren language, Rohingya language, Prakrit and Sanskrit. == Related pages == *Languages of South Asia *Iranic languages == References == ==Further reading== *Morgenstierne, Georg.
