Subject: 2005 Atlantic hurricane season
The '''2005 Atlantic hurricane season''' was the time from June 1 to November 30, 2005 when hurricanes officially formed in the Atlantic Ocean. Storms sometimes form before and after these dates but most storms form during the season. Tropical Storm Zeta formed on December 30 and dissipated on January 6, which is after the November 30 end of the season. It was the most active Atlantic hurricane season in recorded history. 2005 broke many records set. There were 28 storms that were tropical storms, which was broken by the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season. There were 15 storms that became hurricanes. For the first time ever storms were named by the Greek alphabet as the normal name list had all been used up. The storm which caused the most damage was Hurricane Katrina, which hit New Orleans, Louisiana, USA, and killed over 1000 people. The strongest storm of the season was not Katrina, it was Hurricane Wilma. Wilma was the strongest hurricane ever in the Atlantic Ocean, reaching a record low pressure of 882 mbar. ==Storms== '''Tropical_cyclone#Classifications :''' '''Numbers 1 - 5''' indicate Hurricane, from 1 (weakest) to 5 (strongest)'''TS''' Tropical Storm | '''TD''' Tropical Depression | '''SS''' Subtropical Storm | '''SD''' Subtropical Depression === Tropical Storm Arlene=== Arlene, the first storm of the season, formed near Honduras on June 8 and moved north. It came close to western Cuba on June 10 before entering the Gulf of Mexico. Arlene strengthened just below hurricane strength before making landfall on western Florida.

The tropical cyclone formed on August 13 from a tropical wave that entered the Atlantic Ocean on August 8. Because of strong wind shear, the depression stayed weak and did not strengthen much. The cyclone itself had no effect on land and did not cause any damage. It mostly wikt:die out on August 14, but its remains later helped to form another storm, Hurricane Katrina. ===Tropical Storm Jose=== Tropical Storm Jose was a strong but very short lived storm. It quickly formed in the Bay of Campeche and made landfall in Mexico. Tropical Storm Jose dissipated the next day. Tropical Storm Jose caused 8 deaths and $45 million in damages.http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/TCR-AL112005_Jose.pdf ===Hurricane Katrina=== Hurricane Katrina was a powerful category 5 hurricane. Katrina was the costliest hurricane in U.S. history. Katrina devastated the U.S. Gulf Coast, especially New Orleans, a city in Louisiana. It beat the old record from Hurricane Andrew. Katrina left $125 billion in damage and 1,836 dead.http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/TCR-AL122005_Katrina.pdf ===Tropical Storm Lee=== Tropical Storm Lee formed east of the Lesser Antilles as a tropical depression on August 28. On the next day, the depression weakened into a tropical low. The low then moved north and became stronger. It became a tropical storm for a short time on August 31. Lee quickly weakened again into a remnant low and was absorbed by a cold front on September 2.http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/TCR-AL132005_Lee.pdf ===Hurricane Maria=== Hurricane Maria was a major hurricane in September 2005. This storm was rare because it affected New Jersey, Iceland, Scotland, and Norway.

This was the third of eleven uses of a "P" name. ===Hurricane Rita=== Hurricane Rita was a powerful category 5 hurricane that started east of the Bahamas on September 26. It moved south of Florida and into the Gulf of Mexico. Rita became a category 5 hurricane very fast, then made landfall. Hurricane Rita made landfall as a category 3 hurricane in Texas, on September 24. By September 26, Rita had died over the U.S. The hurricane killed about 120 people and caused $10 billion in damage. This was only the second time that an "R" name was used in the Atlantic, the first being 1995 Atlantic hurricane season#Hurricane Roxanne. ===Hurricane Stan=== Hurricane Stan was the sixth of the seven storms in 2005 to make landfall in Mexico. The storm caused $1 billion in Mexico and the Central American region. The exact number of people killed is unknown, but the guess is around 1,660, though it could be up to 2,000. ===Tropical Storm Tammy=== Tammy was a tropical storm that only existed for a total of two days and brought minor damages to the southeastern United States. It peaked with 50mph (85km/h) just before making landfall on the northern Florida coast. Tammy formed from a strong non-tropical low on October 5 just off the Floridan coast. It moved north, peaking with 50mph (85km/h) winds just before making landfall on Atlantic Beach, Florida on October 6. Tammy died shortly later. Most of the damages were losses from FEMA that totaled up to $30 million. Tammy also killed 10 people. This was only the second time that a name starting with the letter "T" in the Atlantic Ocean. The first use was from 1995 Atlantic hurricane season#Hurricane Tanya. ===Hurricane Vince=== Hurricane Vince was a very rare and unusual hurricane.

The storm performed another rare feat, which was making landfall in Spain. This was the first time that a "V" name had been used in the Atlantic. ===Hurricane Wilma=== Hurricane Wilma was the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean.

It killed at least 7 people in the Canary Islands and caused about $360 million in damage. The remains were last seen over Morocco. ===Hurricane Epsilon=== Epsilon was a rare December hurricane, the first since Hurricane Lili in 1984. Forecasters incorrectly guessed on how much time it would take for Epsilon to dissipate. Epsilon did not come anywhere near land. ===Tropical Storm Zeta=== Tropical Storm Zeta was the last storm of 2005. The storm formed on December 30 over cold waters in the Atlantic. Tropical Storm Zeta dissipated on January 6, 2006. It was only one of two storms to live in two different years (the other was Hurricane Alice (December 1954), which was in 1954 and 1955). The storm did not affect land or cause any deaths or damage.http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/TCR-AL312005_Zeta.pdf ==Other storms== There were also four storms in and around the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season that were not given any names: Tropical Depression Ten (2005), Tropical Depression Nineteen(19), Subtropics Depression Twenty-two(22), and a subtropical storm that was not found until after it had happened. A subtropical cyclone is a storm that is not quite a tropical cyclone, but is more tropical than an extratropical cyclone. ==Retirement== In the spring of 2006, Hurricane Dennis, Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane Rita, Hurricane Stan, and Hurricane Wilma were retired for the damages they caused, and were replaced by Don, Katia, Rina, Sean and Whitney for 2011. ==References== Category:2005 Atlantic hurricane season
