They are a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, but have had local (autocratic) rule since 1948, and people in the Faroe Islands have had the right to do business with people from all countries since 1856. Most government matters are controlled by the Faroese government, except for military defense. The Faroes have similarities to Iceland, Shetland, the Orkney Islands, the Outer Hebrides and Greenland. The island group, or archipelago, left Norway in 1815. The Faroes have their own representatives in the Nordic Council. == History == The first recorded evidence of people living in the Faroe Islands was written in the 9th century. Irish monks had lived here. == Regions and municipalities == Administratively, the islands are divided into 34 Municipalities of the Faroe Islands within which there are 120 or so cities and villages. Traditionally, there are also the six ''sýslur'' ("regions"; Norðoyar, Eysturoy, Streymoy, Vágar, Sandoy and Suðuroy).

The introduction of Burger King in Tórshavn was widely publicized but no one knows how things will go for this company.
