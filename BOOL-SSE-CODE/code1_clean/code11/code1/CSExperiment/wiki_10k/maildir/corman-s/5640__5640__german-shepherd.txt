| altname = }} The '''German Shepherd''' (), also known as the '''Alsatian''', is a breed of medium-large size dog. It was first developed in Germany. They are often used as police dogs, but they have many other uses. They have been variously used as herding dogs, guard dogs, military dogs, eyes for the blind and as pets. Because of their intelligence, speed, drive, eagerness and balance, they are now called 'multi-terrain' dogs as well as 'most complete dog breed' for their versatility, adaptability and suitability. An important modern use is in search and rescue. In former times the American Rescue Dog Association only used air-scenting Alsatians to locate people who are missing or lost. They search in wilderness, disaster, human body remains and water search and rescue and recovery missions. The breed is smart, athletic and can live in a wide variety of climate conditions.
