Image:Nuvola_apps_ktip.png'''Important things to remember''' * Be nice! If someone makes a change you don't like, leave a polite message on the article's talk page asking why. * Keep a neutral point of view (NPOV). This means that when you make changes try to consider other ways of looking at things, not just your own opinion. * Watch what you write. We are an encyclopedia, so articles must be about something important. See Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not for more of what you shouldn't write. * Be aware of copyright. Do not put material on Wikipedia that is copyrighted by somebody else. As most things on the Internet are copyrighted, do not just copy information from a web page. Use your own personal knowledge. ---- {| style="width:100%; background:transparent;" | '''Wikipedia:Student tutorial/page4''' | '''Wikipedia:Student tutorial/page6''' |} Category:Wikipedia Schools
