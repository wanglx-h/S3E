File:John Forbes Nash, Jr. by Peter Badge.jpg '''John Forbes Nash Jr.''' (June 13, 1928 May 23, 2015) was an Americans mathematician who worked in game theory and differential geometry.Nash, John F. (May 1950) [https://www.princeton.edu/mudd/news/faq/topics/Non-Cooperative_Games_Nash.pdf Non-Cooperative Games], PhD Thesis, Princeton University. He was born in Bluefield, West Virginia. He shared the 1994 Nobel Prize in Economics with two other game theorists, Reinhard Selten and John Harsanyi. ==Early life== Nash was born on June 13, 1928, in Bluefield, West Virginia. He studied at Princeton University and at Carnegie Mellon University. ==Career== The winner of a Westinghouse scholarship, he attended the Carnegie Mellon University, where he received both his bachelor's degree and his master's degree in 1948. From Pittsburgh he went to Princeton University where he worked on his equilibrium theory. He received a Doctor of Philosophy in 1950 with a dissertation on non-cooperative games. The thesis, which was written under the supervision of Albert W. Tucker, contained the definition and properties of what would later be called the Nash equilibrium. His studies on this subject led to three articles: * "Equilibrium Points in N-person Games", published in the ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'' (USA) (1950); * "The Bargaining Problem" (April 1950) in ''Econometrica'', and * "Two-person Cooperative Games" (January 1953), also in ''Econometrica''. Nash also did important work in the area of manifolds (complex spatial structures): * "Real algebraic manifolds", (1952) ''Ann. Math.'' 56 (1952), 405 – 421. (See also ''Proc. Internat. Congr. Math.'', 1950, (AMS, 1952), pp.516 – 517.) This work led to ''Nash embedding theorem'': "Two real algebraic manifolds are equivalent if and only if they are analytically homeomorphic."

Nash married Alicia Lopez-Harrison de Lardé in 1957. They had one son. Nash had a first son out of wedlock to Elenor Stier.. In 1963, the couple divorced. They later remarried in 2001. Nash lived in West Windsor Township, New Jersey for a long time. ==Death== On May 23, 2015, Nash and his wife Alicia were killed in a car accident near Monroe Township, New Jersey. A taxi that they were riding in was struck by another vehicle and the pair was ejected from the taxi. Nash was 86 years old. == References == == Other websites == * [http://www.nobel.se/economics/laureates/1994/nash-autobio.html Autobiography] at the Nobel Prize website * [http://www.math.princeton.edu/jfnj/ Nash's home page at Princeton] * [http://reference.allrefer.com/encyclopedia/N/NashJF.html John Forbes Nash Jr Information] * [http://www.princeton.edu/mudd/news/faq/topics/nash.shtml Nash FAQ] from Princeton's Mudd Library, including a copy of [http://www.princeton.edu/mudd/news/faq/topics/Non-Cooperative_Games_Nash.pdf his dissertation] in Portable Document Format * [http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/archives/2001/02/27/page3/ Beautiful mind, unconventional matter] , a 2001 ''Daily Princetonian'' interview * [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/nash/ PBS documentary] * [https://web.archive.org/web/20021219150933/http://film.guardian.co.uk/Distribution/Redirect_Artifact/0,4678,0-667864,00.html John Nash speaks out about alleged bisexuality] Category:Abel Prize winners Category:American geometers Category:American Nobel Prize winners Category:Scientists from West Virginia Category:People with schizophrenia Category:Road accident deaths in New Jersey Category:1928 births Category:2015 deaths Category:Differential geometers Category:Nobel Prize in Economics winners
