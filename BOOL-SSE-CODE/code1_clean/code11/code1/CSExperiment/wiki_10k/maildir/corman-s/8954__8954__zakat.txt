Generally, a Muslim is expected to give ''zakat'' as long as they are able. Through Zakat wealth reaches to the poor class of the society. It is considered to be a personal responsibility for Muslims to help those in need and eliminate inequality. It is often 2.5% of what the Muslim has.Yusuf al-Qaradawi (1999), Monzer Kahf (transl.)
