Mali is bordered by Algeria on the North, Niger on the east, Burkina Faso and the Côte d'Ivoire on the south, Guinea on the south-west, and Senegal and Mauritania on the west.

Mali's Capital (city) and most populated city is Bamako. ==History== The Mandé people founded several kingdoms in the Sahel. This was a big area that included Mali. These kingdoms included the Ghana Empire, the Mali Empire, and the Songhai Empire. Timbuktu was an important city in these empires because a lot of Trans-Saharan trade went there. Timbuktu was also a good place for learning. The Songhai Empire became much smaller after a Morocco attack in 1591. France invaded Mali in 1880. After that, France owned Mali. France gave Mali the names ''French Sudan'' and the ''Sudanese Republic''. At some times it also included other nearby countries. In early 1959, Mali and Senegal united and they became the Mali Federation. They became independent from France on June 20, 1960. Senegal left the Mali Federation a few months later. The '''Republic of Mali''', with Modibo Keïta as the first List of heads of state of Mali, left the French Community on September 22, 1960. There was a coup in Mali in 1968. Modibo Keïta lost his job and was put in prison. Mali was then ruled by Moussa Traoré until 1991. He treated the country badly, and so there was another coup in 1991 after protests against the government, and a Constitution of Mali was made. The leader of the country was then Amadou Toumani Touré. In 1992, Alpha Oumar Konaré won Mali's first democratic election. President Konaré won again in 1997 and he made big political and economic changes. In 2002, Amadou Toumani Touré won the election and he started his second term as head of state. He was a retired general and was the military leader of the 1991 coup. Today, Mali is one of the least stable countries in Africa. ==Regions and cercles== File:Mali Regions.png Mali is divided into 10 regions and 1 district. The country is further divided into 49 Cercle (Mali), containing 288 "arrondissements" and 703 communes. The regions and district are: * Gao Region * Kayes Region * Kidal Region * Koulikoro Region * Ménaka Region * Mopti Region * Ségou Region * Sikasso Region * Taoudenni Region * Tombouctou Region (Timbuktu) * Bamako Capital District ==Geography== File:Mali carte.png Mali is the world's 24th-largest country. The area of the country is 1,240,000 square kilometre (478,734 square mile). Mali and South Africa are about the same size. It is two times bigger than Texas. Most of Mali is part of the Sahara Desert. Mali is does not have any sea coast. It is landlocked. Mali does not have many mountains. Flat areas in the north are covered by sand. Savanna is around the Niger River in the south. The climate is dry. The dry season is hot and dusty. There are many natural resources in Mali, including gold, uranium, phosphates, kaolinite, salt, and limestone. ==Economy== File:Kati market street (and Amadu).jpg]] Mali is one of the poorest countries in the world. 65% of its land area is desert or something similar. There have been several long droughts over the last hundred years. Therefore, most economic activity is near the Niger River. About 10% of the people are nomads and 80% of workers have jobs in farming and fishing. Industry is mainly to process farm products. Women also do pottery and the pots are bought and taken to markets. Many foreign tourism like the traditional methods which the women use to make the pots. Mali's main export is cotton, so if the price of cotton changes, Mali's economy is affected a lot. Mali also receives a lot of financial help from other countries. In 1997, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) recommended a programme for changing the economy and the government followed this. Several international companies started exploring for larger amounts of gold in 1996-1998, and the Malian government thinks that Mali will become an important gold exporter soon. ==Demographics== File:Mali-demography.png There are several ethnic and religious groups in Mali. * Mandé (Bambara, Malinke, Soninke): 50% * Peul (Fula/Fulani): 17% * Voltaic: 12% * Songhai: 6% * Tuareg and Moor people: 10% * Others: 5% These religions are common in Mali. * Islam: 90% * Traditional Mali Beliefs: 9% * Christianity: 1% ==Culture== File:The new mosque in mali atamari.jpg being built in Bamako]] About 90% of people from Mali follow Sunni Islam, but they do not always forget their traditional religions. Islam have their own schooling system. The number of Muslims from Mali who go to Mecca is increasing and some study in Arab countries. About 1% of the people are Christianity. When Mali was under French control, Christian teachers were sent to Islamic areas. The language of Mali under French rule was French language, but now not many people outside towns can read or write this language. However, about 60% of the people use other languages well. Many people can read and write in Bamanakan (the most popular spoken language). This language has its own alphabet, called N'Ko. Other people can read and write in Arabic language, after going to an Islamic school. One of the oldest universities in the world is Sankore University in Timbuktu. It began in the 1400s. Famous musicians from Mali include Kora (instrument) player Toumani Diabaté, and the guitarist Ali Farka Touré, who has died. ==References== ==Other websites== * * * Category:Mali Category:1960 establishments in Africa Category:Least developed countries Category:Members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation Category:French-speaking countries
