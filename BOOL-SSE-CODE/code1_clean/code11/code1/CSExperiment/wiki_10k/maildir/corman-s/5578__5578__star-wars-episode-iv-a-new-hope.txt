It is the first film made in the ''Star Wars'' saga, but is the fourth film in the story's timeline. The movie was released in 1977 and also incorporates adventure, action and drama. In 1989, Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope was selected by Library of Congress into the United States National Film Registry. == Plot == The film takes place years after Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, which was made in 2005 as a prequel. The Rebel Alliance has stolen the secret plans for the Galactic empire's superweapon known as the Death Star. Darth Vader and his Stormtrooper (Star Wars) capture Leia Organa, a leader of the Rebellion but she secretly gives the Death Star plans to two droids (robots), C-3PO and R2-D2. The two droids escape to a desert planet called Tatooine, where they are bought by Luke Skywalker and his adoptive parents, Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru. Luke and the droids are attacked by desert natives called "sand people", but are rescued by Luke's friend, Obi-Wan Kenobi, who is a Jedi. Obi-Wan explains that the Jedi used a power known as the Force to keep peace in the galaxy until the Empire hunted them down. R2-D2 shows Obi-Wan the distress call from Princess Leia. Luke finds out that stormtroopers have destroyed his home, including his aunt and uncle, in search for R2-D2. Luke decides to accompany Obi-Wan and the droids to Alderaan, Leia's homeworld. They go into a local cantina, where they meet two pilots, Han Solo and Chewbacca. Han Solo is a smuggler/pirate, who is in debt to a crime lord named Jabba the Hutt. Luke, Obi-Wan and the droids leave the planet with Han and Chewbacca in their ship, the ''Millennium Falcon.'' On board the Death Star, Darth Vader and Grand Moff Tarkin interrogate Princess Leia and use the superweapon to destroy her homeworld Alderaan. The ''Millennium Falcon'' arrives and they discover Alderaan's destruction. The Death Star uses its technology to capture the ''Millennium Falcon'' and bring it aboard the space station. Luke, Han, Obi-Wan and Chewbacca decide to sneak around the station to rescue Leia. They eventually find her in a cell. As they try to escape, Darth Vader kills Obi-Wan in a lightsaber battle, but the rest of the heroes escape on the ''Millennium Falcon.'' They arrive at the Rebel base and R2-D2 gives the secret plans to the Rebels and they discover a weakness in the Death Star. They organise an attack on the Death Star in their small ships called starfighters. With the help of the Force, Luke is able to destroy the Death Star. The Rebellion celebrates their victory. == Main cast == * Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker * Harrison Ford as Han Solo * Carrie Fisher as Leia Organa * Alec Guinness as Obi-Wan Kenobi * David Prowse as Darth Vader, voiced by James Earl Jones * Anthony Daniels as C-3PO * Kenny Baker as R2-D2 * Peter Mayhew as Chewbacca * Peter Cushing as Grand Moff Tarkin * Denis Lawson as Red Two (Wedge) ==Related pages== * ''Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace'' * ''Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones'' * ''Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith'' * ''Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back'' * ''Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi'' ==Other websites== * [http://www.starwars.com/episode-iv Official website] * * * [http://movies.wikilot.com/wiki/Star_Wars_%281977%29 Star Wars at the Movie Wiki] Category:1977 science fiction movies Category:20th Century Fox movies Category:Movies directed by George Lucas Category:Screenplays by George Lucas Category:Star Wars Skywalker Saga movies Category:United States National Film Registry movies Category:American science fiction movies Category:1970s English-language movies Category:1970s epic movies Category:American epic movies Category:Movies about extraterrestrial life Category:1977 action movies Category:1970s American action movies Category:1977 adventure movies Category:1970s American adventure movies Category:1977 war movies Category:American war movies Category:Robot movies Category:Movies composed by John Williams Category:Movies that won the Best Visual Effects Academy Award
