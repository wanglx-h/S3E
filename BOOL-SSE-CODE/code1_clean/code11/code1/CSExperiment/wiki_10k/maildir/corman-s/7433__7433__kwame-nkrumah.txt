He was well known as the first Prime Minister, then President, of Ghana. He imagined a Pan-Africanism. On March 6, 1957, after ten years of campaigning for Ghanaian independence, Nkrumah was elected president and Ghana gained independence from British Empire rule. == Early life and activism == Nkrumah was born '''Francis Nwia-Kofi Ngonloma''' in Nkroful, a town in Gold Coast (the British colony that was to become Ghana) to Kofi Ngonloma, a goldsmith, and Elizabeth Nyaniba, a salesperson, who he saw as a great inspiration. == Education == He attended Elementary School at Half Assini where his father worked as a goldsmith. A German priest called George Fischer influenced his education. He went to a school for teachers in Accra, then became a teacher himself. In 1935 he went to Lincoln University in the United States. He learned more about Communism. His education continued at the University of Pennsylvania, from 1939 to 1943. In 1945 he went to London and organized an international conference for African freedom. At that time he changed his name to "Kwame". == President of Ghana == Nkrumah returned to the Gold Coast and founded the Convention People's Party. He was elected Prime Minister. When Ghana became independent from England, Nkrumah was its first president. He created the flag of Ghana. He required all children to attend school. More women attended school and took jobs. For electricity, Nkrumah ordered the building of a hydroelectric dam known as the "Akosombo Dam" and a nuclear power plant. The military and police forced Nkrumah from power on February 24, 1966. == Exile and death == In 1972, Kwame Nkrumah died in Bucharest, Romania. According to some sources the reason for his death was cancer. However, his close relatives believed there was a chance he was being poisoned by Western agents. His health began rapidly failing after the mysterious death of his chef while in exile in Guinea. == Timeline == * 1930: Obtained Teacher's Certificate from the Prince of Wales’ College at Achimota (Formerly Government Training College, Accra) * 1931: Teacher, Roman Catholic School, Elmina (Central Region) and later, Head teacher, Roman Catholic junior School Axim (Western Region) * 1932: Teacher, Roman Catholic Seminary, Amisano (Central Region) * 1935: Entered Lincoln University, Pennsylvania, USA. * 1939: Earned a BA (Lincoln University), USA * 1942: Earned a BA (Theology), Lincoln University, USA * 1943: M.Sc.
