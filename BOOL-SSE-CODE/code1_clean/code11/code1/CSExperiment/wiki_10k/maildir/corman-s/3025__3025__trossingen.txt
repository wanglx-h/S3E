It is in a region called Baar (region), between the Swabian Alb and the Black Forest. Trossingen is called a "music town". It has around 16,000 people who live there, there is the 'University of Music Trossingen', which is one of Baden-Württemberg's state conservatories, and there are other institutions specialized in musical education, like the 'Bundesakademie für musikalische Jugendbildung' and the 'Hohner Konservatorium'. In 1857 the Hohner company was founded. Today, Hohner harmonicas and accordions are famous all over the world. Trossingen houses the German Harmonica Museum, too. Trossingen also has a historic railway: the ''Trossinger Eisenbahn''. Several skeletons of the dinosaur ''Plateosaurus engelhardti'' were found in Trossingen during excavations in the early 20th century. The local museum Auberlehaus houses several of the original bones. == Distances == * Stuttgart (capital of Baden-Württemberg): about . * Berlin (capital of Germany): about . * the Black forest: about . * Switzerland: about . == References == == Other websites == * Category:Tuttlingen
