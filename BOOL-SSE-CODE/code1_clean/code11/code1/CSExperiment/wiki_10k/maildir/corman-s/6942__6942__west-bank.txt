The State of Palestine claims the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. However, Israel and some other nations disagree that the West Bank is Israeli territory. The West Bank has been under Israeli occupation of the West Bank. Since 1990, the Israeli government and the Palestinians have had many talks about what will happen in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in the future. Most people on the West Bank are Palestinians, but there are also many Jewish settlers in settlements. The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank to be illegal under international law. == Geography == The West Bank Borders of Israel to the west and Jordan to the east. It touches the Dead Sea and the River Jordan. Hill or desert make up most of its landscape.
