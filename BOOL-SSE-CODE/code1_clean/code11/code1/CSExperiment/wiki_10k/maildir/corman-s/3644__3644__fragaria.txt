'''''''''' is the Latin name scientific name for the genus of about 20 species of '''strawberries''', plants in the rosaceae that grow small sweet (taste) red fruit. The most well-known and most grown of these species is the strawberry ''Fragaria''× ananassa''. The other species are informally known as the '''wildstrawberries'''. ==Name== '''' is a Latin word for the group of "strawberry-like" plants, formed by putting '''' ("strawberry") together with the suffix '''', which here means something close to the English language ":wikt:en:-like". ==History== People have eaten different kinds of wild strawberries for thousands of years. In Europe, people usually grew the woodland strawberry. Dutch people learned how to eat them through most of the year by planting their seeds at different times, letting them harvest for nine months of the year. The Alpine strawberry became popular around the 1650s because it was a little bigger and could grow in places with less strong sunlight, like the British Isles in the late autumn. Today's bigger strawberry was first made around Brest (France) in Brittany (northwest France) in the 1750s. It was made by joining the Virginia strawberry from eastern North America to the European Hautbois and the Chilean strawberry from western South America.. ==Kinds== The species of the genus '''' are: * Strawberry or garden strawberry () * Woodland strawberry ('''') * Alpine strawberry ('''') * Virginia strawberry ('''') * Chilean strawberry ('''') ==Fruit== File:Camarosa strawberry.jpg The real fruit of the strawberries are the achenes, which people usually think of as the little seeds around the outside of the larger red "fruit". What people think is the "fruit" is really the swelling stems between these fruit. This kind of fruit, where different ovary grow into a single larger fruit, is called an "aggregate fruit". ==References== Category:Strawberries
