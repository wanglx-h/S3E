Subject: 1996 U.S. campaign finance scandal
The '''1996 United States campaign finance controversy''' was an alleged effort by the People's Republic of China to influence domestic United States politics during the United States presidential election, 1996. The Chinese government denied all accusations. Twenty-two people were eventually convicted of fraud or for funneling Asian funds into the United States elections, and others fled U.S. jurisdiction. In late 1996, the Justice Department opened a task force to investigate allegations of illegal donations to the Clinton/Gore re-election campaign and to Clinton's legal defense fund.[http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1997/9612/19/justice.expand/ "Justice To Expand Inquiry To Clinton's Legal Fund"], ''CNN.com'', December 19, 1996 Ultimately, Justice Department prosecutors secured the conviction of several fund-raisers for various offenses.
