You can use this form to block editing access and account creation from individual accounts or IPs in accordance with the Wikipedia:Blocking policy. '''Please remember to include an informative reason for blocking.''' When using the pull-down menu, please also elaborate on the following line whenever helpful (citing relevant policy pages, Wikipedia:Sock puppetry accounts, the nature of the Wikipedia:Disruptive editing, etc.). Use civil, appropriate, and professional diction. Keep in mind that the block message will be very visible when someone tries to edit Wikipedia through the blocked account or IP. * When blocking legitimate '''bot accounts''', please ensure that you ''disable autoblocks'' to avoid blocking the bot owner. Related pages: Special:Log/block, Special:Blocklist, [ Unblock form], toollabs:ip-range-calc, toollabs:xtools/autoblock, Wikipedia:User talk page warnings#Warnings and notices. === IP addresses === * '''In general:''' Most IP addresses should not be blocked for more than a few days, as they may be reassigned to innocent users. Only in rare cases should IPs be blocked indefinitely. For detailed information on blocking IP addresses, please see Wikipedia:Blocking IP addresses. * '''Shared IPs:''' Before blocking an IP address with a long history of vandalism, please check if it is a shared proxy server or part of a dynamic IP address pool.See Wikipedia:Blocking IP addresses#Shared IPs for details on how to identify and tag such addresses. When blocking, please ensure that ''Prevent logged-in users from editing from this IP address'' is unchecked to limit collateral damage to innocent users. * '''Blocks of governmental IP ranges:''' If you block ''any'' IP in the ranges listed above under the "Sensitive IP addresses" table, you ''must'' notify the meta:Communications committee immediately (see contact instructions there or use meta:Communications committee/Notifications). These ranges are allocated to major governmental organizations; blocks of these organizations have political and public relations implications of which the Foundation's press relations team must be aware. Avoid long blocks of these addresses, and '''be especially careful in formulating your block messages''' because your block message will probably be seen and commented on by the press. ---- __NOTOC____NOEDITSECTION__
