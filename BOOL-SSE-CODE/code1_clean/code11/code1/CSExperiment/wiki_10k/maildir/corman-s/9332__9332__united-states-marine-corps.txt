File:Operation Moshtarak.jpg.]] The '''United States Marine Corps''' (also known as '''USMC''') is one of the six branches of the United States Armed Forces in the United States Department of Defense. It was created in 1775 as a special Marine (military). Although it is part of the United States Navy, it is a separate military branch with its own special ranking structure. It also has its own Naval aviation. The Marines have been involved in many conflicts and had important roles in key battles such as Tripoli, Battle of Iwo Jima, Guadalcanal campaign, and Incheon Bay. Every Marine receives infantry training to be ready for battle at all times. Marine training is also known for being especially challenging. At 13 weeks long, it is the longest basic training of the six military branches. The Marines place a large emphasis on morale (confidence, enthusiasm, and discipline), as is reflected in their motto, ''semper fidelis'' (Latin for "always faithful"), which is often shortened to ''semper fi''. Samuel Nicholas founded the Mariner and was its first commissioned officer. The birthplace of the Marines is the Tun Tavern, in Philadelphia. == Related pages == *USS Gyatt, a ship named after a Marine Raider who was killed at the Battle of Guadalcanal == Other websites == * [http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps United States Marine Corps] -Citizendium Category:United States Marine Corps Category:1775 establishments in the Thirteen Colonies
