Subject: Carnivore
A '''carnivore''' is an animal, or less commonly a plant, which eats only meat. The word Carnivora comes from Latin, where ''carne'' means "flesh" or "meat", and ''vorare'' is a verb meaning "eat", that is "meat-eater". Predators commonly hunt and kill their own prey. '''Scavengers''' are carnivores which eat animals they did not kill themselves. Carnivores which eat mainly or only insects are called insectivores. Carnivores which eat mainly or only fish are called '''piscivores'''. The word "carnivore" describes more than just the scientific order Carnivora. However, almost all animals in the Carnivora do eat meat, though a few, for example Giant panda, do not.Ullrey, Duane E. Nutrient requirements: carnivores.
