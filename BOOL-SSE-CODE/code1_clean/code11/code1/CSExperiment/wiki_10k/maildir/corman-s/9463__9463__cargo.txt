The vehicle is usually a truck or freighter or cargo aircraft or freight train. Prefabricated cargo is a type of cargo for transportation in prefabricated batches, which are completed at the expense of piece units and container volumes. The noun is used as not Noun#Countability; people will talk about ''some'' freight. Today, goods other than bulk cargo are usually packed in Containerizations, which are carried. A place which loads or unloads cargo is usually called a ''cargo terminal''. == Related pages == * Cargo plane * Cargo ship == References == == Other websites == * [http://cargolaw.com/gallery.html The Gallery of Transport Loss -- Photos & Lessons of Disaster] Category:Transport
