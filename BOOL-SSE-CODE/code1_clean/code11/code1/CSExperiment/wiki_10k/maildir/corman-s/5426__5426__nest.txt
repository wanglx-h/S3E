File:AmericanRobinChicksInNest 1.jpg A '''nest''' is a place where animals build to hold their egg (biology) or provide a place to raise their babies. They are most typical of birds, but many other vertebrates do make nests. Nests can be made of Organic matter such as Twig, grass, and Leaf. They may be a simple depression in the ground, or a hole in a Rock (geology), tree, or building. Nests can be found in all types of habitat. == Other == * * Bird nest * Habitat Category:Ethology
