File:Stranded lamp wire.jpg '''Wire''' is a long, thin and flexible piece of metal. Wires are made in many different metals and sizes, and are used for many purposes. Wire rope has been used for centuries. Electrical wiring is wire used to carry electricity. When people touch wire that is carrying electricity, they get Electric shock, which is bad, so the outside coating of electrical wires is colored. Most electric wires are black, but some wires have a differently colored coating. Different colors indicate different purposes, for example, in the United States, green or bare is a ground (earth) wire, white is a neutral wire, and black, blue, red, brown, yellow, and orange are hot (live) wires. A '''Telephone tapping''' is when law enforcement puts a wikt:device into a phone or other electronic device to hear what suspected criminals are going to do. Copper wire and cable is the best known type of wire, but wire can also be made out of Aluminium or other metals. If we did not have wiring almost all of our electronics would not be working or available. Category:Basic English 850 words Category:Hardware (mechanical) Category:Electrical wiring
