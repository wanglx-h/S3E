'''Giant isopods''' are big crustaceans that live at the bottom of the ocean. They can grow up to 45 Centimeter long and weigh up to 1.7 Kilogram. Currently about 9 different species are known. Giant isopods usually eat dead whales, fish and squid. They may also be active scavengers, and hunt slow-moving prey, such as sea cucumbers, sponges, nematodes. Perhaps they even catch live fish. They live in depths between 170m to about 2200m. Over 80% can be found between 365m and 730m of depth. They probably prefer a muddy or clay ocean floor environment, and lead solitary lives. ==References== Category:Isopods
