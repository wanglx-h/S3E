Subject: Planck mass
The '''Planck mass''' is a small unit of mass used in physics. It is derived using an equation involving Planck's constant, the speed of light in a vacuum, and the gravitational constant. It is approximately 21.76 Microgram. The Planck mass can be thought of as an upper bound for the mass of a single particle. A particle with more mass would become a black hole. It's also a lower bound for the smallest possible black hole, since a black hole this small wouldn't be able to emit any Hawking radiation to evaporate any smaller. As with all Planck units, the idea was to have a definition based only on fundamental universal constants. ==References== Category:Physical quantity Category:Units of mass
