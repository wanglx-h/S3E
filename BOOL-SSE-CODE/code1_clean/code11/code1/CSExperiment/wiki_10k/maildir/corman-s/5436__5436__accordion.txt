File:Accordionist.jpg File:Freret Street Festival 2005, New Orleans - Accordian player.jpg An '''accordion''' is a musical instrument that has keys similar to a piano, but is small enough for a person to hold. It makes sounds using air pushed and pulled through Reed (instrument) using a bellows. The accordion can also have buttons instead of keys. The 6-plus-6-instruments with three rows has the same fingering in all twelve scales. The accordion was first patented in 1829 in Austria by Cyrill Demain. It was invented in Germany by Friedrich Buschmann in 1822. Since then, the instrument has made a significant impact on the world of modern and classical music. The accordion is similar to a portable piano.
