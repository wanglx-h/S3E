Subject: Question
A '''question''' is what someone asks, usually when there is something that he or she does not know. In writing, a question mark ("?") comes at the end of a question. However, just because a question is asked does not mean there is an answer. File:Paul Gauguin - D'ou venons-nous.jpg ==Types of question== Sometimes a question has a simple answer like "Yes" or "No". Sometimes a question has a more complicated answer like "Maybe", or "I don't know". There are so many types of questions and so many ways of answering questions. ==Examples of these questions== People may give a short answer. People may give a long answer. It depends on the question. *"Guess what?" *"Who are you?" *"Can I help you?" *"Do you speak English?" *"Is this your bag?" *"What time is it?" *"Where are you from?" *"Why are you doing that?" *"Who do you want to see?" *"When will tea be ready?" *"What did you say?" *"How old are you?" *"What time is the football game?" *"Why do you look so funny?" *"Why did the chicken cross the road?" *"Where can I find the nearest subway station?" *"Why do you allow people to change an online encyclopedia?" ==Types== Different kinds of why questions need different kinds of answers. A question like "Why did you do that?" clearly asks for an explanation. What that explanation might be depends on Context (language). This kind of explanation is not right or wrong: it all depends on wikt:Circumstance. The question and answer may also have to do with "who", "what", "when" and "where". There are types or forms of explanations,Keil, Frank C. and Wilson, Robert Andrew. 2000. [https://books.google.com/books?id=k703lFAZby8C&pg=PA6&dq= ''Explanation and cognition.'' p6] including: * explanations which are based on a principle or theory.Elman, Colin. (2001). [https://books.google.com/books?id=1q8Frx25Y4wC&pg=PA71&dq= ''Bridges and boundaries: historians, political scientists, and the study of international relations,'' p. 71] "It is often said that a key difference between historians and political scientists is that historians tend to construct narrative-based explanations while political scientists ... tend to construct theory-based explanations". ::''Who should I listen to?'' Answer: ''Mother knows best.'' * explanations which rely on a model or pattern. ::''Where does this part go?'' Answer: ''The pocket is on the left side of the shirt''. * explanations which tell a story or wikt:narrative. ::''When did you do that?'' Answer: ''I ran away after the dog barked.'' * explanations which relate to goals or wikt:purpose. ::''Why are you doing that?'' Answer: ''Because I'm going to build a boat.'' Many kinds of explanations are made up of more than one type. An explanation can be wikt:valid or wikt:invalid or a wikt:combination of both. Some explanations may appear reasonable, but they turn out to be misleading or wrong.Blakesley, David and Hoogeveen, Jeffrey L. 2007.
