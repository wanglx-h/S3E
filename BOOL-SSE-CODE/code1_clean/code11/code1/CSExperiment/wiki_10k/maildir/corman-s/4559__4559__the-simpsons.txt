It was created by Matt Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The show started on December 17, 1989 and so far over 700 episodes have aired in 36 seasons. As of today, the show is in its 36th season. As a full-length movie, ''The Simpsons Movie'', was released on July 27, 2007 as a celebration of the Franchising. It is aimed at the whole family. The comedy takes place in the fictional town of Springfield (The Simpsons), although it is wikt:speculated that its location may correspond to the real-life cities of Springfield, Oregon (a city near where Groening grew up) or Springfield, Wyoming, from the adventures of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie. Homer's name is an Homerous. His full name is Homer Jay Simpson. Bart's name is an anagram of Brat. His full name is Bartholomew Jo-Jo Simpson. This TV show has a yellow skinned cartoon family. In 1998, Phil Hartman was murdered by his wife, resulting in his characters being removed from the show. In 2000, Ned Flander's wife, Maude Flanders was killed off. Also in 2000, Barney Gumble became sober. In 2002, the production of The Simpsons had switched from cels to digital ink and paint. During that time, The Simpsons had suffering of franchise fatigue. "Sneed's Feed and Seed" from the episode "E-I-E-I-(Annoyed Grunt)" became an internet meme. ==History== The television show ''The Simpsons'' was originally shown as short shows on ''The Tracey Ullman Show''. Fox Broadcasting Company then decided to give them their own show in 1989. It has been tremendously successful since onwards. ===Shorts=== ==Episodes== {| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;" |- ! rowspan="3" colspan="2"|Season ! rowspan="3"|No. ofepisodes ! colspan="3"|Originally aired ! colspan="3"|Viewership |- ! rowspan="2"|Season premiere ! rowspan="2"|Season finale ! rowspan="2"|Time slot (Eastern Time Zone) ! rowspan="2"|Avg. viewers(in millions) ! colspan="2"|Most watched episode |- !

Many episodes begin with a scene of Springfield Elementary School, where Bart Simpson is shown writing lines on a chalkboard as punishment for being bad. For example, in one episode, Bart writes, "I will not conduct my own fire drills." The line is supposed to be humourous. Not every episode has a new one and sometimes the chalkboard gag may be cut (removed) because there is not enough time. ===Couch gag=== In the opening, all the Simpsons come home after work or school. After Homer Simpson is almost or is hit by Marge's car, they all go into the living room, where something comical happens again. These are called "couch gags". On one couch gag Homer Simpson walked onto the screen like James Bond and shot the camera. Sometimes if an episode is a short one, then the couch gag will be very long. A couple of couch gags have been over one minute long. Couch gags in earlier seasons were simple but then became more interesting in later seasons. ===Ending credits=== At the end of the show, the credits are shown. Sometimes they might be changed. In one episode, the ending showed Homer reading from a document about Dateline. In another episode, where all of the characters sing in song, Snake keeps firing his gun in order to make the music that was playing stop. ==Movie== A film based on the show, ''The Simpsons Movie'', was released in 2007, specifically on the day that it was released. It included the character Plopper as Homer's new pet after rescuing him from a chain restaurant, Krusty Burger. ==References== ==Other websites== * [http://www.thesimpsons.com/index.html TheSimpsons.com] Official website * * * [http://www.snpp.com The Simpsons Archive] * [http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/S/htmlS/simpsonsthe/simpsonsthe.htm ''The Simpsons''] at the Encyclopedia of Television * [https://simpsonswiki.com/wiki/Main_Page The ''Simpsons'' Wiki] * [http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/Simpsons_Wiki The ''Simpsons'' Wiki at Wikia] Category:1989 American television series debuts Category:1980s American sitcoms Category:1980s animated television series Category:1990s American sitcoms Category:1990s animated television series Category:1990s satirical television series Category:2000s American sitcoms Category:2000s animated television series Category:2000s satirical television series Category:2010s American sitcoms Category:2010s animated television series Category:2010s satirical television series Category:2020s American sitcoms Category:2020s animated television series Category:2020s satirical television series Category:Adult animated television series Category:American animated television series Category:American satirical television series Category:American television spin-offs Category:American English-language television shows Category:Television series about dysfunctional families Category:Fox television series Category:The Simpsons Category:Television series by Rough Draft Studios
