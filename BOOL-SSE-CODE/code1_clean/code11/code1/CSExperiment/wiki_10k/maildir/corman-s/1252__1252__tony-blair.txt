He was Leader of the Labour Party (UK) of the Labour Party (UK) from 1994 to 2007 and Member of Parliament (United Kingdom) (MP) for Sedgefield (UK Parliament constituency) from 1983 to 2007. On the day he stood down as Prime Minister and MP, he was made official diplomat of the Quartet on the Middle East on the Middle East on behalf of the United Nations, the European Union, the United States and Russia. Blair was elected Leader of the Labour Party in the 1994 Labour Party leadership election following the sudden death of his predecessor, John Smith (Labour Party leader). Under Blair's leadership the party abandoned many policies it had held for decades. Labour won a landslide victory in the 1997 United Kingdom general election, which ended 18 years of Conservative Party (UK) rule with the heaviest Conservative defeat since 1832 United Kingdom general election. He was the Labour Party's longest-serving Prime Minister and the only leader to have taken the party to three uninterrupted general election victories. Gordon Brown, Chancellor of the Exchequer during all Blair's ten years in office, succeeded him as party leader and Prime Minister in 2007. ==Early life== Blair was born at Queen Mary Maternity Home in Edinburgh on 6 May 1953. He was the second son of Leo and Hazel Blair. Blair joined the Labour Party in 1975. ==Career== Blair was a lawyer before becoming a politician. He married Cherie Blair, also a lawyer, who graduated from the London School of Economics with a first-class honours Academic degree. Blair himself left Oxford University with a second-class degree. They have four children: Euan, Nicky, Kathryn, and Leo. There was a controversy over Blair sending Euan to a grant-maintained school. As a result of this, Alastair Campbell discovered Blair "standing stark naked reading the ''Daily Mail''." ===As Prime Minister=== As Leader of the Labour Party (UK), he won the 1997 United Kingdom general election, 2001 United Kingdom general election and 2005 United Kingdom general election UK general elections. Blair is the first and only Labour Party leader to have won three general elections in a row. He attributes his success in politics to a pair of "lucky Brogue shoes", which he wore for every single Prime Minister's Questions of his leadership. He claimed that "cheap shoes are a false economy". Blair strongly supported a number of elements of US foreign policy, notably participating in the invasions of Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003. He faced heavy criticism for this. The facts about Iraq's possible possession of weapons of mass destruction that he relied on, which later turned out to be false, led many to perceive him as dishonest. Playwright Harold Pinter and former Prime Minister of Malaysia Mahathir Mohamad said Blair committed war crimes. Criticism also arose for his involvement in bombings of Yugoslavia in 1999 when he supported the Kosovo Albanian UÇK guerrillas. ===After-PM=== On the day of his resignation, Blair was made an official envoy in the Middle East. In 2004, he started the Commission for Africa.
