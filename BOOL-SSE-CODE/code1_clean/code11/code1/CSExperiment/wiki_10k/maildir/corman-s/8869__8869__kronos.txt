The son of Gaia (mythology) (Mother Earth) and Uranos (Father Sky), he was the youngest of his brothers. At the urging of Gaia (mythology), Kronos castrated his father with a sickle and overthrew him, ruling the cosmos as king during the so-called Golden age. Kronos married his sister Rhea (mythology), and sired the first generation of the Twelve Olympians: Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Hades, Poseidon, and Zeus. In fear of a prophecy that told of him being overthrown by his own children, Kronos swallowed each of them as soon they were born. Only the youngest, Zeus, managed to escape this fate and, after freeing his siblings, waged war against Kronos and the other Titans. During this Titanomachy, the Olympians emerged victorious, and Kronos himself was cast into Tartarus. In some versions, Kronos was later freed by Zeus and became ruler of the Elysian Islands. == In popular culture == Kronos appears as the main antagonist in Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson & the Olympians series and in some episodes of Stargate SG-1. ==Other websites== Category:Titans
