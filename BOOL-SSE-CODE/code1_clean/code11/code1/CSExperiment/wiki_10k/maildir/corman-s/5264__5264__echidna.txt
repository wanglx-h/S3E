They have mammary glands, and lay Egg (biology). The echidna has a method of protecting itself. With its long, sharp claws, they quickly dig a hole until only their spines are showing when they are hiding in the hole. The predator is not be able to get it without injuring itself on the spines. When there is a fire, the echidna digs down out of reach of the fire. == Prey == The short-beaked echidna (''Tachyglossus'') eats termites and ants.
