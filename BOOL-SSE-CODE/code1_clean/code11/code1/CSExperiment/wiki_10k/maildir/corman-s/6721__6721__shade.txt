The dark image which the object casts on the ground (or on another object) is called shadow, not ''shade''. '''Shade''' can also mean a darker or lighter color of the same base color. For example: in a picture of a tree's shadow, the grass in the shade will be a darker ''shade'' of green than the grass out of the shade. Category:Basic English 850 words Category:Optics
