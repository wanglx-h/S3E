File:Universe expansion2.png began in an extremely dense and hot condition and has expanded. The theory suggests that redshift proves the universe is expanding.]] The '''Big Bang''' is a Theoretical physics about how the universe started expanding, and then made the stars and galaxy we see today. The Big Bang is the name that scientists use for the most common theory of the universe, from the very early stages to the present day. The most commonly considered alternatives are called the Steady State theory and :en:Plasma_cosmology, according to both of which the universe has no beginning or end. According to the theory the Big Bang began as a very heat, size, and dense superforce (the mix of the four fundamental forces), with no stars, atoms, form, or structure (called a "singularity"). Then about 13.8 1,000,000,000 years ago, Outer space expanded very quickly (thus the name "Big Bang"). This started the formation of atoms, which eventually led to the formation of stars and galaxies. It was Georges Lemaître who first noted (in 1927) that the universe is expanding. The universe is still expanding today, and getting colder as well. As a whole, the universe is growing and the temperature is falling as time passes. Cosmology is the study of how the universe began and its development. Some scientists who study cosmology have agreed that the Big Bang theory matches what they have observed so far. == Naming == Astronomer Fred Hoyle mockingly called the theory the "Big Bang" on his radio show. Scientists who did not agree with him decided to use it. == Evidence == Scientists base the Big Bang theory on many different observations. The most important is the redshift of very far away galaxy. Cosmological redshift is the Doppler effect occurring in light. When an object moves away from Earth, its color rays look more similar to the color red than they actually are, because the movement stretches the wavelength of light given off by the object. Scientists use the word "red hot" to describe this stretched light wave because red is the longest wavelength on the visible spectrum. The more redshift there is, the faster the object is moving away. By measuring the redshift, scientists proved that the universe is expanding, and they can work out how fast the object is moving away from the Earth. With very exact observation and measurements, scientists believe that the universe was a singularity approximately 13.8 billion years ago. Because most things become colder as they expand, scientists assume that the universe was very small and very hot when it started. This does not take into account other possible (non-cosmological) causes of redshift. Other observations that support the Big Bang theory are the amounts of chemical elements in the universe. Amounts of very light elements, such as hydrogen, helium, and lithium seem to agree with the theory of the Big Bang. The same is true, however, for Static State theory and plasma cosmology. Scientists also detected what they call the cosmic microwave background radiation. These Electromagnetic radiation are everywhere in the universe. This radiation is now very weak and cold, but is thought to have been very strong and very hot a long time ago. == Time == It can be said that time had no meaning before the Big Bang. If the Big Bang was the beginning of time, then there was no universe before the Big Bang, since there could not be any "before" if there was no time. Other ideas state that the Big Bang was not the beginning of time 13.8 billion years ago. Instead, some believe that there was a completely different universe before the Big Bang, and it may have been very different from the one we know today. Nonetheless, in November 2019, Jim Peebles, awarded the 2019 Nobel Prize in Physics for his theoretical discoveries in physical cosmology, noted in his award presentation that he does not support the Big Bang Theory due to the lack of concrete supporting evidence, and stated, "It's very unfortunate that one thinks of the beginning whereas in fact, we have no good theory of such a thing as the beginning." == Graphical timeline of the universe == Many things happened in the first picosecond of the universe's time: ImageSize = width:720 height:1000 PlotArea = left:40 right:256 bottom:75 top:75 Colors = id:period1 value:rgb(1,1,0.7) # light yellow id:period2 value:rgb(0.7,0.7,1) # light blue id:events value:rgb(1,0.7,1) # light purple id:era1 Value:yellowgreen id:era2 value:lightorange id:time1 Value:coral id:time2 Value:lavender DateFormat = yyyy Period = from:-430 till:155 TimeAxis = format:yyyy orientation:vertical # order:reverse does not work ScaleMajor = unit:year increment:10 start:-430 # second ScaleMinor = unit:year increment:2 start:-430 AlignBars = justify BarData = bar:Clock bar:Era bar:Dummy3 bar:Periods bar:Dummy4 bar:Events TextData = fontsize:M pos:(240,75) text:Planck epoch pos:(250,50) text:Big Bang pos:(20,50) text:"0: Linear time" pos:(10,980) text:"Logarithmic time:" text:"10 · log10 second" pos:(154,946) text:"NEXT" pos:(117,931) text:Graphical timeline of the Stelliferous Era pos:(245,950) text:"Reionization" LineData = layer:front at:123 frompos:358 tillpos:369 width:0.5 # Matter domination points:(369,878)(402,800) width:0.5 points:(402,800)(413,800) width:0.5 PlotData= textcolor:black fontsize:M width:53 bar:Clock color:events align:right shift:(28,3) mark:(line,teal) at:-120 text:"One picosecond" at:-90 text:"One nanosecond" at:-60 text:"One microsecond" at:-30 text:"One millisecond" at:0 text:"One second" at:36 text:"One hour" at:75 text:"One year" at:105 text:"One thousand years" shift:(43,3) at:135 text:"One million years" width:53 bar:Era mark:(line,white) align:center shift:(0,0) from:-430 till:135 color:era1 text:"The Five Ages of the Universe" width:53 bar:Dummy3 width:158 bar:Periods align:center shift:(0,0) mark:(line,white) from:-430 till:-360 color:period1 text:Grand unification epoch from:-360 till:-120 color:period2 text:Electroweak epoch from:-120 till:-60 color:period1 text:Quark epoch from:-60 till:0 shift:(-40,0) align:left color:period2 text:Hadron epoch from: 0 till:23 color:period1 text:Lepton epoch from: 23 till:131 color:period2 text:Photon epoch from:131 till:155 color:period1 text:"Timeline of the Big Bang#Dark Ages" width:53 bar:Dummy4 width:53 mark:(line, blue) textcolor:black fontsize:M bar:Events color:events align:left shift:(30,-4) at:-430 shift:(30,-12) text:"Planck time, the smallest theoretically observable ~unit of time and the time before which science is ~unable to describe the universe.
