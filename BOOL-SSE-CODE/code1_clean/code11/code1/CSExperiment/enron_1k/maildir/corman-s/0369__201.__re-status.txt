Yikes!!!! I can understand your preoccupation with those issues out there. I am sure that you are all "talked out" about it, but if you need an empathetic ear, give me a buzz. Talk to you later. Michelle PS I saw Julie Parraguirre last night, and she told me to say hello. She is going to be teaching at the same school that Cameron attends!
