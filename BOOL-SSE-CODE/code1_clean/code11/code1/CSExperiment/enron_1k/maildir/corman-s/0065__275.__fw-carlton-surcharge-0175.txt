Subject: FW: Carlton Surcharge .0175
Just wanted to let everyone know about this change in the Carlton commodity surcharge - this will be effective 11/01/2001 and will take the place of the old $.04 charge that we used to see on deliveries to Mid 17 for the winter months. If you have any questions, please let me know. Thanks, Raetta -----Original Message----- From: Bianchi, Rita Sent: Monday, November 19, 2001 4:26 PM To: Zadow, Raetta; Berger, Larry; Fiscus, John; Cohrs, Allen; Korbelik, Stephanie; Paladino, Ranelle; Dasilva, Esther; Buehler, Craig Subject: Carlton Surcharge .0175 In case you haven't heard, last week we received FERC approval to change the Carlton commodity surcharge from $.0062 to .0175. I have sent the updates to IT to load into TRS for this winter and for the next 3 years (through 3/2005). The surcharge may change before 2005, but I thought it would be better to have our most recent approved rate than to leave it at either zero or $.04. Please pass this information along to anyone in your area that needs to know. Thanks.
