Hi Cindy, I know this is a trivial question in the greater magnitude of things....so just drop me an email when you get a chance. For my 2002 UW contribution, I asked to have a lumpsum payroll deduction in Feb. (unsual bonus time). Now, I want to have UW just bill me instead. I can't seem to get back into the system to change this. ???? Shelley x37083
