Richard - I will need your help on responding to this request- there are a lot of questions I cannot field. I can provide the fixed gen pricing for the building with LF 65%, however all the other questions center around renewable questions. You will need to take lead on majority. John McCarthy works in EES and prepares formal responses to inquiries of this nature If you can help him with those questions, he is very quick at putting the general info needed on Enron together and putting in a nice binded document with very speedy turnaround Let me know how you want to proceed- it's due 11/9 thanks Kq
