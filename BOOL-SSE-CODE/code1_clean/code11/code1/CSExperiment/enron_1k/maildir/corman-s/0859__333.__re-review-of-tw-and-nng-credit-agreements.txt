Subject: RE: Review of TW and NNG Credit Agreements
We found no cross-default provisions in the material contracts. Moreover, FERC standards of conduct required pipelines to keep contracts, books and records separate from other Enron entities. -----Original Message----- From: Wilkie, Kim Sent: Wednesday, November 28, 2001 3:49 PM To: Corman, Shelley Subject: Review of TW and NNG Credit Agreements Shelley, I am reviewing the TW and NNG Credit Agreements to determine what was triggered by today's activities - one question that my review raised is whether there are any cross-default provisions in the Material Contracts (as defined in the credit agreements). Dorothy said that you looked at them and might know the answer - any chance?? Thanks, Kim
