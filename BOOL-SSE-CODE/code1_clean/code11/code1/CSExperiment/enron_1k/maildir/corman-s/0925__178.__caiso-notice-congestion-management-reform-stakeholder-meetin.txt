Subject: CAISO Notice - Congestion Management Reform Stakeholder Meetings
Market Participants: After yesterday's announcement of CMR stakeholder meeting schedule changes, we learned of a conflict with previously-scheduled meetings on August 15 that affected many of you who have been active in the CMR process. As a result, we have rescheduled the stakeholder meetings to discuss details of the CMR Recommendation for August 16-18. We give you specifics of these meetings as soon as they are available. Byron Woertz Director, Client Relations
