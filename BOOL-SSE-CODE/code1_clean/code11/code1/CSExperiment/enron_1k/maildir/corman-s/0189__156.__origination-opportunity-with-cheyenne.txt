Subject: Origination opportunity with Cheyenne
PacifiCorp terminated its service to Cheyenne Light Fuel and Power effective 2/ 24. Below is a summary of the dispute between PacifiCorp and Cheyenne and FERC resolution. Here's your chance to be a hero. On December 20, Cheyenne Light, Fuel and Power Co. filed a complaint against PacifiCorp requesting the FERC to order PacifiCorp to continue service to Cheyenne under the rates, terms and conditions of the Power Sales Agreement (PSA) following December 31, 2000, until at least such time as PacifiCorp has provided notice of termination a minimum of 60 days in advance of the proposed termination date. Cheyenne is a full requirements customer of PacifiCorp under a power sales agreement executed and filed with FERC in 1995 with a term that expires on December 31, 2000. Cheyenne has attempted to agree to terms with PacifiCorp for a replacement power sales agreement, but PacifiCorp has demanded prices many times higher than current prices under the PSA and substantially higher than the $74 per MWh benchmark price FERC recently established as a presumptively prudent long-term price for sales in the California markets. PacifiCorp will terminate service under the PSA upon its expiration on December 31, 2000, but PacifiCorp has not filed with FERC a notice of termination of the PSA. Cheyenne stated that termination of service could impair Cheyenne's ability to serve its retail customers, thereby harming both Cheyenne and its customers. On December 26, PacifiCorp filed a notice of termination for the PSA with Cheyenne. On December 27, PacifiCorp filed an unexecuted letter agreement with Cheyenne under its market-based tariff for power sales as a replacement for the Existing Agreement. Order issued February 7 (1) dismissing Cheyenne,s complaint; (2) accepting PacifiCorp,s notice of termination and denying its request for waiver of our notice requirement, to allow the PSA to terminate at the end of the day on February 24, 2001; and (3) rejecting PacifiCorp,s unexecuted letter agreement. Since the Order is denying PacifiCorp,s request for waiver of notice and accepting the notice of termination and Cheyenne opposed the rates under this letter agreement in any event, Order found no need to accept the alternative interim agreement offered by PacifiCorp. Requests for Rehearing due March 9.
