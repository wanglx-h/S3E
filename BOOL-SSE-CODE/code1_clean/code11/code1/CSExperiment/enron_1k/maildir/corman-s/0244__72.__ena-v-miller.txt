Dear Michelle: We have set a meeting with Cristina Solomon and Liz Miller that I am assured is set in stone. It will take place tomorrow at 10am at Cristina's office. Can you attend? I have given Cristina the agenda items so that she and Liz can be prepared to answer all of our questions. Best regards, Linda Broocks P.S. Can you have lunch this week with Laura Gibson and me?
