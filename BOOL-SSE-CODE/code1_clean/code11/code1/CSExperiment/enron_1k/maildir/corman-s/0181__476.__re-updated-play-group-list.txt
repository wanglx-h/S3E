We are planning to attend, although I am going to a networking happy hour at my old firm. I have got to get out there, as you can appreciate!! But I hope to see you at Kari's house. I know Trey and Cam will be there. Michelle -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net)
