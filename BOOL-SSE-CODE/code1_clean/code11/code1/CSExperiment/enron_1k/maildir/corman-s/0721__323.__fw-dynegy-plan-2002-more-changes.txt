Subject: FW: Dynegy Plan - 2002 - More Changes
Shelley, Please see the note below. I recommend taking all the company numbers back to the original plan and any reduction that occurs during the year be viewed as a current estimate. What are your thoughts? Donna -----Original Message----- From: Carpenter, Nancy Sent: Tuesday, March 05, 2002 4:07 PM To: Scott, Donna Cc: Barnes, Caroline; Carpenter, Nancy Subject: Dynegy Plan - 2002 - More Changes Donna, In a Dynegy meeting this afternoon, we were instructed to change the Gas Logistics Dynegy Plan -- which we had submitted at $6.363M -- back to the Original Plan of $6.864M. They viewed the reduction as more of a Current Estimate, so from this point, we will use the $6.864M as the official plan number for future comparisons. (At least for Dynegy purposes.) I will resubmit the plan to Steve Kleb this afternoon. Please inform Shelley about this latest development. Thanks, Nancy
