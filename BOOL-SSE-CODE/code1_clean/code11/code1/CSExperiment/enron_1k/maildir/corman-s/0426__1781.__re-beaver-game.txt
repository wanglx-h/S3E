Subject: RE: beaver game
I switch back and forth from night to day shifts it depends on the week. I have been working day shifts this week. I would say I would like to watch the game but I am actually going to the game. What about a beer later in the week or this weekend. I think Johnson might be in town soon, I reecieved an email from him this week.
