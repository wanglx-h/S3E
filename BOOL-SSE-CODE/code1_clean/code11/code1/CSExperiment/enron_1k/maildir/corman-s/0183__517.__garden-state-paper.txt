Eric, As mentioned in my voice mail, Pat McCarthy is the attorney we use for GSP employment matters. I believe that he may be better suited to answer your questions (and may have the time while I am out on vacation next week). His number is 973-966-8117. I have left him a voice mail telling him that you may give him a call, so he will be prepared. I hope that is helpful. Michelle
