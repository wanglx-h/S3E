Subject: HA 24 schedules
team, Do not send any HA 24 schedules that you do not intend to send. In other words, remove all schedules that are not the specific ones you want to send. We have been sending zero schedule when we don't want to be. If we go back to only sending our HA 24 schedules, we can avoid this problem. Thanks Jesse
