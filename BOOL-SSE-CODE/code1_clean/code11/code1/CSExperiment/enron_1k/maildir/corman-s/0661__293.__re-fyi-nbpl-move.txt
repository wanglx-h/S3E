Subject: RE: FYI - NBPL Move
Rick - Stan has announced that there is a hiring freeze in effect. We will not be permitted to fill this position without making a special appeal to Stan. Couple this with the fact that I need to present to Danny/Stan a proposal on how we can trim our 2002 O&M and I'm not inclined to make such a pick. Lets talk about how we can redeploy our current resources to cover....I especially want to talk about how we pick use the accounting coordinators in an expanded role. -----Original Message----- From: Dietz, Rick Sent: Saturday, November 24, 2001 8:22 AM To: Corman, Shelley Subject: FYI - NBPL Move FYI - Pat Steele was offered (and accepted) a job from NBPL to schedule gas in Omaha. Her first day in their group will be December 17th. Unlike the situation with Michelle Cormier, in which my group absorbed the work associated with her vacancy, I will seek to obtain approval to replace Pat's position. Rick
