FYI. Thanks.

ONEOK Importance: High Ken and Kile, Please see the attached proposed draft letter. I need to fill in one blank, but it is otherwise complete, subject to your thoughts. I will try and get a copy of Sherry Rogers' letter to Harry Woodson of November 1 by fax to you both. Britt P.S. to Lynn and Harry: is it alright with you for Ken to basically be replying to the letter to Harry? Do we also need a "me, too" letter from Harry?
