Subject: Pulse Survey Memo from the Office of the Chairman
In October of this year, we asked you to participate in the &Pulse8 survey. Over 70% of you were willing to take the time to respond. Thank you! This is our highest response to an all Enron employee survey - ever. In exchange for your candid feedback, we want to provide you with an overview of the results for our company. We realize that you and your management have been working hard to build on our strengths and improve in areas of concern for us. The results reflect your substantial efforts. As you can see from the chart below, thanks to the increased focus on these issues provided by the Vision & Values Task Force and your efforts to improve communications, we have made significant progress. Question 1999 % Positive 2000 % Positive Employees are encouraged to challenge the status quo 42% 47% Decisions are communicated well 41% 50% Employees feel free to voice opinions openly 46% 55% Enron does a good job of acting on suggestions of employees 45% 52% Communication across departmental lines is good 30% 34% Congratulations on your fine efforts.
