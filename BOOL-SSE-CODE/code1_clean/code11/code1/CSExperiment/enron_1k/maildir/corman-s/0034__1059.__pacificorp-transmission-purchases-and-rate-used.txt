Subject: PacifiCorp Transmission Purchases and Rate Used
All, There are 7 deals in January entered by several different real-time folks that have PAC tranny purchase price as 8.09 - this is incorrect. When you purchase tranny from PAC please use the rate of 5.84. If you have entered any deals in February at the rate of 8.09 - please go back and fix them. Caroline
