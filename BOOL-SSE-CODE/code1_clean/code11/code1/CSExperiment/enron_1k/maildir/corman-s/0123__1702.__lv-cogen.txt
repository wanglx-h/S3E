Les, we were unable to find power at a reasonable rate for the HE 5 2MW schedule so we therefore we just didn't show up in the PX for that hour. The only offer we recieved was for $225 which I felt was too steep to pay. It turned out well however as the PX price was $120 and there was no cong at Mead so we saved them a little money by not buying the $225. Just thought I would let you know.
