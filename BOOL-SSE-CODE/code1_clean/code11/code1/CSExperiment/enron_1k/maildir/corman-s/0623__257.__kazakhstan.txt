Jackie, I got the call to travel to Kazakhstan for the adoption and will be leaving next Thursday, Dec. 13. I will be in Kazakhstan over Christmas and hope to touch base with your daughter to see about the possibility of locating a Christmas eve worship. I think I've misplaced her email address. If you wouldn't mind, would you forward it to me again. Thanks and have a blessed holiday. Shelley
