i will wait for him to come back with some information on the existing bids that we have with him before making any more commitments... -narsimha -----Original Message----- From: Ring, Richard Sent: Friday, September 28, 2001 10:57 AM To: Misra, Narsimha Subject: PJM_UCAP Narsimha, Couple of other time periods that Nick Politis is asking about: "I have a couple of other time periods for this same customer. They are naturally long and I think I could work something out if you guys are natural buyers. The other 2 periods are: Jun-Dec02 (starting one month later than your last quote). The other period is the PJM planning year Jun02-May03. The amount could be higher if that works for you guys. Let me know if you want to do more than 100 MW and I will see what I can do." Any interest and at what level?
