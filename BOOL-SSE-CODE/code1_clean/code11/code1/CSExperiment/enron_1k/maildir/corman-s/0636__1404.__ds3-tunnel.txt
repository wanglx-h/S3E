Subject: DS3 Tunnel
Today Scott Shishido and I managed to narrow down the problem with the DS3 Tunnel and Scott will be working with EBS and Cisco to find out a solution. We are currently running Terminal Server over the T-1's, as soon as the DS3 is operational and secure we will convert back to the tunnel. I will keep everyone up to date when I have more information. Please contact me if there are any questions. Thanks, Chip Cox
