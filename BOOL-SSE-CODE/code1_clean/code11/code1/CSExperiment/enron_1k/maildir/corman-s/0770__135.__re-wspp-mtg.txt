Hey Young! Perfect timing I tell you, Natalie came down with the croup. Hence I'm staying here to take care of her cuz Dad's out of town also. Real bummer because there's a lot of fun going to happen up there! Have a good time! Maybe we can go hiking around here!

I'm thinking about going for a hike, around the lake, Thursday afternoon. The area supposed to be very pretty. Do you already have a plan? Young
