Subject: Status of November PPA
Gary, could you let me know the status of the NOVEMBER PPA's which would be billed with December commodity billing (actually billed in January)? I want to be sure you received all of the information from the field to make the November PPA adjustments for December production close. My assumption is that you have received all required PPA's since I did not receive a list of outstanding meter information you need from the field. If you have any questions, please give me a call. Thanks. Lynn
