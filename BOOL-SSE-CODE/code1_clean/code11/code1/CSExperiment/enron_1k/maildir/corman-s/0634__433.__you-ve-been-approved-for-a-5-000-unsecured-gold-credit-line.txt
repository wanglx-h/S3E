Quick Inspirations [IMAGE] Home [IMAGE] [IMAGE] [IMAGE] [IMAGE] [IMAGE] [IMAGE] [IMAGE] [IMAGE] Your inspirational quote for the day: [IMAGE] A Little Wisdom [IMAGE] A mirror is only as good As the reflection in it. Worry enough to anticipate trouble But not so much as to bring it about. Look back to where you have been For a clue to where you are going. Melt the icy fingers of fear With the sunshine of hope. Step by gentle step, You can overcome the greatest sorrow. The sweetest grapes Are picked from the vineyard of friendship. Find something you truly believe in, And everything else will have meaning as well. ********************** Did you know, you can order printer ink now for 75% off and get a FREE GIFT?
