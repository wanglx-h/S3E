I may be in tomorrow too after I make sure Alina won't freak out with the babysitter. Next week sounds fine for vacation. I wasn't able to use the global phone in Kazakhstan. But a friend recently rented one and used in Europe. The neat thing is that you use you're reg cell number. Playdate sounds great Talk to you tomorrow. -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net)
