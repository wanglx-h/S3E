Subject: APS and Enron
Does anyone have any issues or ideas on how EES can best work with APS? Jim ----- Forwarded by James D Steffes/NA/Enron on 03/01/2001 08:12 PM ----- Robert Frank 02/28/2001 04:17 PM To: James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Subject: APS and Enron Jim - EES is moving forward w/ plans to site mobile generation in AZ - hoepfully, by summer (originally, it was locomotive engines, but now may be turbines). They want to have a high level contact between Enron and APS to expedite interconnection, but don't know what, if any, business we're doing w/ them right now and if any "issues" exist. Does you have any suggested ENA contacts?
