Subject: ISO Report on Overcharging -- Market Power
I exchanged v-mails with Elena Scmid at the ISO. The leaked information pertains to a filing to be made at FERC today that responds to the FERC Staff's report on market mitigation. The ISO had last week released its own proposed market mitigation plan -- or, as they referred to it, the market stabilization plan. There was much negative response to it. I spoke against it at the Board meeting and submitted written comments in opposition. The Board blessed it "in concept" and agreed to the let the staff file it, but to ask the staff for a few changes. I would be surprised if much has changed since we've seen it. Along with the filing are two staff reports, one by Angeli and one by Eric Hildebrandt that identifyy what they see as market power. According the Elena, she does not believe that the reports use the term "gouging." These reports are just extenstions of what we've seen from the ISO before. Previously, the ISO talked about $650 million or so in potential refunds. These reports extend the time period of the analysis. I've asked Elena to let me know if Enron is named and when it will be posted. Elena says that the ISO also asks for the mitigation period to be at all times not just at 5% of the time as FERC has sugested. It is not yet posted on the ISO web site. The ISO is holding press conference now and I'm listening in. Sue Mara Enron Corp. Tel: (415) 782-7802 Fax:(415) 782-7854
