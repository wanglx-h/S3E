Subject: Re: plans
mark I talked to Jorge last night and we thought we'd just hang out at his place or see a movie on Saturday night. Steve's family is coming over on Sunday for dinner and so is Donald. that's all I know. I'm not sure about skiiing. Jorge and Cherie have been snow shoeing lately and that might be fun since it includes them in the activity and I have never done that. Donald also snow shoes. We can decide Saturday, but I'm definitely up for an activity. see ya, dave ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ----------------------- The information transmitted is intended only for the person or entity to which it is addressed and may contain confidential and/or privileged material.
