Subject: RE: GISB Ratification
I agree with your strategy -----Original Message----- From: Hess, Theresa Sent: Thursday, March 21, 2002 10:01 AM To: Corman, Shelley Subject: GISB Ratification Shelley, FYI A GISB ratification ballot has been distributed. One item is the 'Base Contract for Sale and Purchase of Natural Gas'. We did not participate in this effort because it doesn't affect us. I voted in favor of it at the last EC meeting and plan to support it on the ratification ballot. Richard Smith of ExxonMobil wants this item to be approved. He's been very instrumental in getting our Order 637 transactional reporting issues pushed through GISB. The transactional reporting data sets (EBB usage only) will be voted at the next EC meeting in April. We may need his support. Therefore, I'm supporting him on the base contract. Ratification is due April 19. I'll route and submit ballot as usual Thanks, Theresa
