Subject: RE: PPA Processing
Pre April 1997 was specifically not covered by the 6 month rule. -- but 8 don't think that means that we are automatically required to process all old ppas. I think we should plan to manually handle any pre 1997 ppas that we feel bound to accept. FYI I saw Ken Caminiti at Animal Kingdom yesterday! -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net)
