Subject: BPA Transmission Interconnect moratorium
In discussions with Ruth Bennett at BPA's Transmission Business Line this morning I learned that BPA is entertaining imposing a moratorium on ALL new requests for System Impact Studies and Requests to Reserve Transmission. BPA indicated they have over 33,000 MW's of such studies and requests in the queue and are overwhelmed at this point. They have got to put the skids on this quickly. On a related matter, BPA does not presently draw a distinction between connecting small generating units (1-25 MW) from the larger generating projects. They do understand the importance of allowing small units to get connected for production as early as this summer. Unfortunately, at this point they are obligated to take all requests on a first-come, first-serve basis. The Washington PUD Association has scheduled a meeting with BPA at SeaTac this Friday at 2 p.m. to discuss this situation. If anyone on this list wants to attend that meeting I will get more details. In the mean time, if your thinking of putting generation on the Northwest Federal transmission Network any time in the next few years, you should not delay applying to BPA. Jeff
