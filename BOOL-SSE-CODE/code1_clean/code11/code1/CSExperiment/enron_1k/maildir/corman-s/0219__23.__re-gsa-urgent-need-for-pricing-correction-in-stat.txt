Please notify Deb Weakley that we need a product change on this account.

They have advised me that we are pricing one of our GSA accounts incorrectly. According to Change Request number 0458-Rev 3, the pricing should be tiered. This is not currently happening. Who do I contact in Order Provisioning to assist me with this correction? Also, please advise as to the ETA of a change such as this. Thanks, Dyaniese
