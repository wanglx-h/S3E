Subject: La Plata to Bloomfield Drag Reducing Agent Application Evaluation -
 Estimated Costs
I also wanted to pass on to you the estimated costs that were used: Below are the rough cost estimates to apply drag reducing agent to the LaPlata to Bloomfield line. Facility modifications $1,665,000 Cleaning & application $165,000 Re-application every 6 months $165,000 The facility modifications include a launcher at LaPlata, receiver at Bloomfield and a filter separator at the El Paso Blanco delivery. The cleaning & application and re-applications costs include cleaning pig runs with methanol and surfactant as well costs for the actual DRA application. For analyzing sensitivities, all costs are +/- 30%. The re-application time period is also uncertain. The probable window would be to re-apply as often as every three months and as infrequently as every 12 months. John
