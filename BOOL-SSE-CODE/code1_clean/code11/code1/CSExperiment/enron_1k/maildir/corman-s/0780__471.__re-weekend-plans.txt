Things are going fine at home...but we'll be happy to have Kim home! -----Original Message----- From: Jewell, Cyndi M [mailto:cjewell@bcm.tmc.edu] Sent: Tuesday, February 12, 2002 3:56 PM To: Shelley A. Corman (E-mail) Subject: Weekend Plans Although it is only Tuesday, I am already trying to plan for the weekend. John's brother Gib is visiting us and we were hoping to see you (sans Kim) on Saturday for dinner ... at Lupe's? How is it going in Kim's absence? If I can assist in any way, please let me know. C
