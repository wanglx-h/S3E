Subject: FW: Northern v. ONEOK/Proposed Response to ONEOK's request for a
 Special Test
FYI. Britt -----Original Message----- From: Kile, Rick Sent: Wednesday, October 03, 2001 10:35 AM To: Davis, Britt; gharvey@gibbs-bruns.com; Cessac, Kenneth Cc: Charlie Thompson/GCO/Enron@ENRON; Gaines, David; Peschka, Mike; Graham, Charlie Subject: Re: Northern v. ONEOK/Proposed Response to ONEOK's request for a Special Test The ONEOK letter mentions testing the "chromatograph" as well as the meters. We may need to detail what exactly is "testing the chromatograph". They also want to test "temperature and pressure sampling probes" this may need to be clarified. I also questioned the need to send the meters to the Netherlands, are there ways to nullify the uncertainity effect of the flow lab? Could we use the TransCanada facility? I have called George Kneisley to see if he has details regarding a document he sent out where the flow labs were "trued up" to match each other. Ken, do you remember anything like that? If we need to send the meters to the Netherlands I have no problem with that, I just wondered of it was necessary. On the second page, in the paragraph the starts with "Third", I think we need to change the statement regarding "matched pairs". We did not flow calibrate the meters with the intent of being matched pairs. We only matched the upstream piping, with the Gallagher Flow Conditioner, and the meter. I agree that the condition of the gas may have introduced some contaminants into the Rich inlet meter, and if that happened then those same contaminants may have been introduced into the Rich outlet meter. Should we approach this with the idea that if the Rich inlet test just as it did in the Netherlands test, then there is no reason to test the Rich outlet? If there is a difference in the flow test on the Rich inlet, then we would insist on testing the Rich outlet. This is just an idea, it may be best to test Rich inlet and Rich outlet no matter what the findings. Attached is a small revision that needs worksmithing. Thanks.
