Welcome to the heat!!! If you would re-send your resume to me, I'll re-send it to my contacts here in town and let them know that you now are available. I think I may have a firm that could use your skills!

Just to update you, I am now based in Houston permanently. I am still following up the leads you kindly provided me with. However I would be grateful if you would consider me for any suitable future positions which you become aware of. Many thanks for your continuing assistance.
