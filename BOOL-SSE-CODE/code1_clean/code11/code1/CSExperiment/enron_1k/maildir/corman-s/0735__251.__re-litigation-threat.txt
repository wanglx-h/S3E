Attached is our response. Basically, he was upset that we hadn't responded yet to his letter of last week. Please let me know if you are ok with this letter, and we will send over a final copy via fax for your signature. Michelle, I will send a copy your way as well, in addition to yesterday's letter, our response to the first letter, and the legal advice we received from Freshfields. Pls. let me know if you have any questions. Thanks, Caroline << File: Letter to Jim Weisser11.14.01.doc >>
