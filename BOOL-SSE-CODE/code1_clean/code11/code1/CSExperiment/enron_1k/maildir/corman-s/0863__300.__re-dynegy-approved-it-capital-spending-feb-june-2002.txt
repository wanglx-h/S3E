Subject: RE: Dynegy Approved IT Capital Spending Feb - June 2002
It was my understanding that Dynegy would send an e-mail formally documenting their approval. Shelley, were they going to send that to you? -----Original Message----- From: Barnes, Caroline Sent: Wednesday, February 20, 2002 5:58 PM To: Hotte, Steve; Corman, Shelley; Rahn, Nick Cc: Carpenter, Nancy; Krone, Amy Subject: Dynegy Approved IT Capital Spending Feb - June 2002 Please see below and let me know if you agree with what I thought I heard was approved from our meeting with Dynegy last Thursday. I have included the 3 Gas Control Items requested as if approved. If all agree upon this list, I will need to put together a spending schedule by month for each line item to be used in the NNG cash management meetings. Thanks?cvb << File: Dynegy approved IT capital feb to june 2002.xls >>
