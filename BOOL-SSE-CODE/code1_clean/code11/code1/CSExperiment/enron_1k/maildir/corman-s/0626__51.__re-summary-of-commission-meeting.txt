Namely, GridFlorida must improve stakeholder participation; must report on further developments to ensure obligations of reliability and interface functions according to Order 2000; and must further define the rights of passive owners understanding that any veto rights of passive owners will be subject to review by FERC. RT01-67 Southwest Power Pool,s application to form an hybrid RTO is rejected. SPP,s application was limited to Entergy and SPP only and therefore, has not meant the scope and regional configuration as directed by Order 2000. The required report according to the Federal Power Act, Section 203 was not filed. The order does permit SPP to change its merger affiliation to join an RTO and approves the filing regarding the board selection process. RT01-34 FERC is issuing a Notice, RM99-2 inviting comments from the industry on interregional coordination. A technical conference will be scheduled after comments are received. FERC has been disappointed in the filings with regard to the interregional participation; hence, the Notice. CPUC v. El Paso, RP00-241. This order discusses CPUC,s complaint that El Paso Merchant intentionally acquired more capacity than needed to manipulate price spreads. The order dismisses denies summary judgment and dismisses the complaint. FERC stated that El Paso Merchant has not violated any standards of conduct. With respect to the issue of market power, the current record is not considered to be complete. However, FERC will schedule a hearing to complete and review the record.
