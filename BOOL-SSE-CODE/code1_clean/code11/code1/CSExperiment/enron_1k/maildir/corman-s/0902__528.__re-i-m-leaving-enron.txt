Mary: Good luck in your new job. If you ever come through Boston look us up. We are in Cambridge in Harvard Square (land of economic consultants). I have done quite a bit of work on the New England market in the past, especially on market design issues, and have always enjoyed it. Are you from New England? I remember you went on holiday in Maine last autumn. All the best, Seabron
