Hey, sorry I didn't write you back sooner however I had a six day break. Anyway, ST Pattys day was a blast, Dahl and Pat and I started drinking around 10am and by the time the night was over we had been to 10 different bars, (got kicked out of two) met up with a ton of people and had an overall blast. I was so hating it the next day. My sister was up from LA this weekend. We had a really good time. Went to Touche and the Gypsy on Thursday, went to the Blazer game and then Scooters. On Saturday night we went to the Kennedy School, and on Sunday we went to Multnomah Falls and took her to Beaches for lunch. She had a really good time and it was nice to have her up for the weekend. Anyway, how is everything with you?
