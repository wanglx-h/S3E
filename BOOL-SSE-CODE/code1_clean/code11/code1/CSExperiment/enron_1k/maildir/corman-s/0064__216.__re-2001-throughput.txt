Subject: RE: 2001 Throughput.
Unfortunately, I can only (immediately) help by providing throughput data for the Enron pipelines that was recently provided for another data request that covered the period 1996 - 2000. It is attached below and has a tab for Transwestern. The 2001 FERC Form 2 delivery data is not yet available since the Form 2 will not be completed until April 30, 2002. Please let me know if you have difficulty finding the data elsewhere and I will ask the TW marketing or regulatory groups if they have any contacts.

Kevin Howard suggested that I contact you regarding some data for the attached slide. I am looking for average throughput for four pipes in 2001. Please let me know if you have this information. Thank you, Michael << File: 2001 Throughput.ppt >>
