Subject: Northern v. ONEOK/Meeting Thursday to discuss ONEOK's letter of
 October 16 to Dave Neubauer
Ladies & Gentlemen: At Dave Neubauer's request, I am going to schedule a meeting for tomorrow to which you are all invited (and if I have left out a necessary participant, please let me know) to formulate a response to ONEOK's letter of October 16 to Dave (a copy of which I will circulate to you). It has to do with the proposed special test. I will have my a/a, Lee, circulate copies of (a) Dave's letter of October 5 and (b) ONEOK's reponse of October 16 to you all immediately. Given that so many schedules are involved, I went ahead and picked a time that both Drew and Dave have open: 4:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m tomorrow, Thursday, October 18. Debbie has reserved the video conference rooms in 49C2 and in Omaha. Lee will get a call-in conference number for anyone that can't attend in person, and e-mail it out to you. I appreciate your patience. Many thanks. Britt
