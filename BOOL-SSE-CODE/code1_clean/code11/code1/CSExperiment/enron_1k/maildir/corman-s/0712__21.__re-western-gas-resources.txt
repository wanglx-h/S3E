Randy, what did this mean to shippers nominating on NNG's pipe? Do they have to change their location or POI number for nomination purposes? If so, how did we communicate to the shippers. How does this effect OBA's? Thanks for the update.

With the exception of clearing up a few loose ends involving some accounting issues the sell of the Gomez Plant and related gathering system, the Mitchell CO2 plant and related gathering system, and the pipe between Mitchell Plant and Gomez is complete effective June 1st.
