Sorry....missed your name on the cc: list!! diana ---------------------- Forwarded by Diana Scholtes/HOU/ECT on 03/12/2001 10:18 AM --------------------------- Diana Scholtes 03/12/2001 10:19 AM To: Asem Atta/HOU/ECT, William Crooks/NA/Enron cc: Subject: Asem/Bill, I have talked to Mary Hain regarding our non-ability to gather information out of our Harvester from certain parties, in particular WAPA, WALC, PCW, Idaho. She has some contacts at all of those. Could you give me a brief summary of who you have contacted and exactly what the hold up is? And some input as to how you would like us to approach it from legal. This will be a friendly push, so hopefully we get a friendly response! Thanks, Diana
