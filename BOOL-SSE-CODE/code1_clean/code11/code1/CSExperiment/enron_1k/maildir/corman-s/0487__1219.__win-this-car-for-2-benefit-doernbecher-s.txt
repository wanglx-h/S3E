Subject: Win This Car for $2 - Benefit Doernbecher's
Hi All, Our car club has partnered with Kiwanis International in this year's classic car raffle. The car is a 1965 Mustang GT Fastback, in red, and all proceeds will be donated to Doernbecher's Hospital. The tickets are $2 each, and I have them available if you would like to puchase some. The car will be raffled off at the Oregon State Fair in Salem on September 3, 2001, and you need not be present to win. A photo of the car is attached for your viewing pleasure. Caroline
