Subject: Northern v. ONEOK/Spreadsheet attachment to letter to ONEOK re
 Fisher Roc
Ladies & Gentlemen: Here is the spreadsheet that Ken plants to attach to his letter to ONEOK re the Fisher Roc lock-up period. If this causes anyone any heartburn, please let me know ASAP. Again, I'd like to get out the letter from Ken, with this spreadsheet attached, this afternoon. Many thanks.
