After they finished puberty, and before menopause, women are usually able to get Pregnancy and give birth to Baby. Women have historically been treated differently from men. They have also been expected to Gender role. In many places, the treatment of and expectations for women have changed with the spread of women's rights in the 20th century. Transgender women were born male but socially live as women, and attracted more attention in the late 20th to early 21st century. == Biology == File:Anterior view of human female and male, with labels 2.png Women have sex organs including a vagina, uterus, and ovaries from birth.

In 1996, the average height of women around the world was 159 cm. === Pregnancy and childbirth === Between the end of puberty and menopause, a woman can become Pregnancy. Women go through puberty usually when they are between ten and sixteen years old. The menopause usually starts in the late forties, and ends in the early fifties. Between these ages, women go through a menstrual cycle, once a month. If such a woman has Sexual intercourse with a man, at the right time of the month, and no contraception is used, the woman may get pregnant. ==== Getting pregnant ==== File:Pregnancy 26 weeks 1.jpg File:Lactancia bebe aire libre.jpg her child. ]] A woman who has Sexual intercourse with a man, at the right time, may get pregnant, if no contraception is used. Contraception will stop a pregnancy. When she gets pregnant, the ovum of her menstrual cycle will be fertilized, and attach itself to the wall of the uterus. In humans, a pregnancy usually takes about 38 weeks. After this time, a child is born. For childbirth, a woman usually gets help from specially-trained people, called Midwife. During the pregnancy, the woman should regularly see a doctor. Very often, these doctors are specialized, and are called Gynecologist or Obstetrician. After the child is born, the woman will breast-feed her child for some time. Sometimes women who are very young get pregnant. These pregnancies are known as Teenage pregnancy; very often, they are more difficult than normal ones. ==== Keeping a pregnancy from starting ==== If a woman had sex with a man, and no contraception was used, there's the risk of her getting pregnant. If she does not want to get pegnant, she has some time to take what is called emergency contraception. Emergency contraception protects against unwanted pregnancies, as it keeps the pregnancy from starting. It does not protect against Sexually transmitted disease. Also, it will not work all the time. Very often, women who want to get emergency contaception also need to spend some time with a professional in a counselling session. Depending on the country, emergency contraception may not be available, or it may not be legal. ==== Stopping a pregnancy ==== Humans also have the possibility to stop a pregnancy, when it has started. Stopping a pregnancy is called abortion. When people do it on purpose, it is called ''induced abortion''. Pregnancies that stop on their own are called ''spontaneous abortion'', miscarriage or stillbirth. Depending on the country or region, a pregnancy can be stopped at any time, or there are limits, for how long it can be stopped. Pregnancies that have gone on longer are generally more difficult to stop. Many countries have Law that say for what reasons, a pregnancy can be stopped. One of a common set of reason is that continuing the pregnancy would be dangerous to the woman. Another common reason is that the pregnancy was the result of a rape (the woman did not want to have sex with a person). Still another would be that the child would be born with certain Birth defect. All of these reasons vary by country. In some countries, they also vary by area. Some countries are very liberal, others are more restrictive. Some countries or territories do not allow abortion at all. ==== During the pregnancy ==== During the pregnancy, the woman will change too. There are many things a woman should no longer do. Many Drug have a bad effect on the child growing inside her. The woman therefore needs to watch the drugs that she takes, and she needs to tell the people who give her the drugs (at the pharmacy) that she is pregnant. Note that drinking Alcoholic drink, or smoking Cigarette also has a bad effect on the unborn. ==== Giving birth ==== In humans, a pregnancy lasts 266 days, on average. Most children are born within two weeks of the calculated date. Only four percent of the children are born on the calculated date. With birth, the unborn child leaves the womb.There are certain signs that a birth is about to occur: * The womb (also called uterus) will contract regularly, at first about once every 10 minutes * A slight bleeding * The amniotic sac will break (this is called rupture of membranes) * Either diarrhea or vomiting A woman giving birth will feel pain, much more pain than other animals (such as the Great ape).This is mainly due to the fact that the head is big, and the pelvis is rather small. In many countries, Hospital are specially equipped to handle births. Giving birth at a hospital has the benefit that the woman can get help faster, if anything goes wrong. For this reason, most births happen at a hospital. In some cases, people can also give birth at home. ==== Anonymous birth ==== Some countrires allow a woman to Anonymous birth. That way, the woman does not have to give her name, or much other personal information. The baby will then be given up for adoption, so that another couple can raise the child. ==== Giving the child away ==== File:Baby hatch in Sandomierz.jpg File:20230123 Epione clinic Katowice Piotrowicka 01.jpg In many countries there are hospitals with Baby hatch. A woman can put her child in such a hatch. The baby will be raised and cared for, and it will be given up for adoption. Many women who are unable to raise the child use baby hatches. == Rights == Women have historically had less control over their lives than men. They have often been forbidden to own land, vote, hold political office, or choose whom they Marriage and discouraged from voicing political opinions or attending school. Since the beginning of the 20th century women have gained many rights in most of the Developed country. Women have also historically faced a lot of sexual violence, Sexual harassment, and Sexism. The amount of sexual violence, harassment, and discrimination has decreased with the spread of women's rights, but many women still face these problems. ==Gender roles== Women have historically been expected to bear and raise children, limit their public lives, and allow their male relatives to make decisions for them. These expectations have changed with the spread of women's rights. == Education == Before modern societies, education of women was limited. In developed country, most women have access to education, and even perform better than men at many levels. In the United States in 2005 and 2006, women have earned 62% of associate degrees, 58% of bachelor's degrees, 60% of master's degrees, and 50% of doctorates. Education, especially for women, has become more common in most countries in the 20th and 21st centuries than it was previously. == Women at work == File:Preparing a measles vaccine in Ethiopia.jpg, preparing a vaccine, in Ethiopia.]] File:WomanFactory1940s.jpg In most countries, women work, like men. Their jobs are sometimes different, and sometimes their work is what society expects. In jobs, that have ot do wirth education, or with healthcare, there are generally more women than men. If women and men do the same job, women often earn less for their work. This is known as gender pay gap. Also, there are fewer women in leading roles of companies. == Women in politics == File:Benazir Bhutto.jpg was Prime Minister of Pakistan twice.]] Some women have become successful Politician. In 2019, about a quarter of all politicians were female. Nordic countries were in the lead, with over 42%. The fewest female politicians can be found in Oceania, with just over 16%, Middle East and North Africa, with 19%, and Asiatic countries with just under 20%. In most countries, women have the same rights to vote, and to get elected than men. This has not always been the case. The question, whether women should be able to vote is called women's suffrage. Only very few countries in the world do not allow women to vote or to get elected. == Science, literature, and art == Throughout history, women have made contributions to science, literature, and art. There were many female writers, but many published their work under a male name. In music, women have been composer, songwriter, performer, singers, conductor, scholar, teacher, critic and more.

It is often used for women. == Femininity == File:Villers_Young_Woman_Drawing.jpg'' by Marie-Denise Villers (1801), depicts a feminine spirit.]] ''Femininity'' (also called ''womanliness'' or ''girlishness'') is a set of attributes, behaviors, and roles generally associated with women and girls.
