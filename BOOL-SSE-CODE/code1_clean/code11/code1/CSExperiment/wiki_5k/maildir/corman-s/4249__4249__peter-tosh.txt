'''Peter Tosh''' (born '''Winston McIntosh''', October 19, 1944- September 11, 1987) was a Jamaican reggae music musician. He was a member of the Wailers with Bob Marley and Bunny Livingston. He was a Rastafarian and sang very political songs. His songs were a lot more radical than his friend, Bob Marley's, whom he often criticized for selling out to the white mainstream. He also toured with the Rolling Stones and sang a duet with Mick Jagger. He was murdered in his home in Kingston during a robbery in 1987. His biggest claim to fame was a song titled "Legalize It" in relation to marijuana laws. ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== * ''Negril (Peter Tosh album)'' (1975) * ''Legalize It'' (1976) * ''Equal Rights (album)'' (1977) * ''Bush Doctor'' (1978) * ''Mystic Man'' (1979) * ''Wanted Dread And Alive'' (1981) * ''Mama Africa (album)'' (1983) * ''No Nuclear War'' (1987) * ''I Am That I Am'' (2001) ===Live albums=== * ''Captured Live'' (1984) * ''Live at the One Love Peace Concert'' (2000) * ''Live & Dangerous: Boston 1976'' (2001) * ''Live At The Jamaica World Music Festival 1982'' (2002) * ''Complete Captured Live'' (2004) ===Compilations=== These are the highest rated compilation albums on Allmusic. * ''Collection Gold'' (1994) * ''The Toughest'' (1996) * ''The Best of Peter Tosh - Dread Don't Die'' (1996) * ''Honorary Citizen'' (1997) * ''Scrolls Of The Prophet: The Best of Peter Tosh'' (1999) * ''Arise Black Man'' (1999) * ''The Essential Peter Tosh - the Columbia Years'' (2003) * ''Talking Revolution (2005) ==References== ==Other websites== * [http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=Bo7d1vwmta9rk/ Peter Tosh] on Allmusic * [http://lpdw.free.fr/groupes/petertosh/discographie.htm Discography] * [http://www.jamaicapage.com/peter-tosh-baddest/ Peter Tosh - Jamaicapage.com Feature] * [http://www.vitalspot.com/petertosh VitalSpot - Peter Tosh] Category:1944 births Category:1987 deaths Category:Jamaican reggae musicians Category:Murdered musicians Category:Jamaican activists Category:Jamaican singer-songwriters
