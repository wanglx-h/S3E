Subject: Evolutionary biology
'''Evolutionary biology''' is a subfield of biology that studies how species start and change over time; or in other words, how species evolution. Someone who studies evolutionary biology is known as an '''evolutionary biologist'''. ==History== Evolutionary biology became an academic subject as a result of the modern evolutionary synthesis in the 1930s and 1940s.Sterelny K. 2009. Philosophy of evolutionary thought. In Michael Ruse & Joseph Travis. ''Evolution: the first four billion years''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press. p313/4. It was not until the 1970s and 1980s that universities had departments which used the term ''evolutionary biology'' in their titles. As a result of the rapid growth of molecular biology and cell biology, many universities have split their biology departments into ''molecular and cell biology''-style departments and ''ecology and evolutionary biology''-style departments. These have absorbed older departments such as paleontology, zoology, botany and the like. == Related pages == *Evolution *Modern evolutionary synthesis *Speciation *Natural selection == References == Category:Evolutionary biology
