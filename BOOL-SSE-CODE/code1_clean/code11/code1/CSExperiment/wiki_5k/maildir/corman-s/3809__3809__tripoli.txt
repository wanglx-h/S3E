It is the Capital (city) of the country. More than three million people live in the metropolitan area. Originally a Phoenician colony, Tripoli became in turn part of Greek and Roman Cyrenaica, a pirate port, a part of the Ottoman Empire, and the capital of the Italian Empire in North Africa.[https://lu1960.blogspot.com/2020/12/italian-tripoli.html Italian Tripoli] ==References== Category:Phoenician colonies Category:Tripoli
