Their best known song is "Happy Together". Chip Douglas was a band member, who left to producer the Monkees, then returned as the Turtles producer. After the Turtles broke up in the 1970s, the group's two frontmen, Howard Kaylan and Mark Volman, sang with Frank Zappa as '''Flo and Eddie'''. The Turtles are known for their songs Happy Together and She'd Rather Be With Me. They were originally active from the years 1965 to 1970, and split up for thirteen years before Kaylan and Volman made the band again in 1983. == Albums == * It Ain't Me Babe (1965) * You Baby (1966) * Happy Together (1967) * The Turtles Present the Battle of the Bands (1968) * Turtle Soup (1969) * Wooden Head (1970) * Chalon Road (1986) * Shell Shock (1986) Category:Musical groups from Los Angeles Category:American pop music groups Category:American rock bands Category:Folk music groups
