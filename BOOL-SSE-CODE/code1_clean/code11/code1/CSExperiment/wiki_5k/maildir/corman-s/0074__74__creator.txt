A '''creator''' is a person who creates something. In some religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam) God (or Allah meaning '''the God''' in Arabic language) is the most important and original creator of the whole universe - including Human who is made "in his image" (see Genesis) to Astronomy it and control it like God. The idea that anything that a person is creating, like an idea, can be ownership as property comes from the ethical traditions and legal codes that came from these religions. In other traditions (Buddhism, Native American mythology) anyone has this potential for creating, and can become part of the greater creating of the universe. Stewardship of home, Ecological footprint is a test for participating in this, or just good sense. == Related pages == *Creation myth Category:Theology
