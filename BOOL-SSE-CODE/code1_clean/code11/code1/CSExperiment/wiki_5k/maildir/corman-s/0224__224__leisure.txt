During vacation, some people travel to a different region or country and stay at a hotel so that they can do things they could not do near home. Other people prefer to spend their vacation time at home in their own community. In rich developed nations such as the United States and Canada as well as in most European countries, workers are allowed to stay home on the weekend (usually Saturday and Sunday) and use it as leisure time. People in underdeveloped countries usually have less leisure time, as they have to work longer hours and more days per year. Category:Leisure
