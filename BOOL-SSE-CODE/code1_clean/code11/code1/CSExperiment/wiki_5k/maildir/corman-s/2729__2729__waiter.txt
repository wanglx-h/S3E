They are usually called a waiter because they wait for the order. A female waiter is called a '''waitress'''. They will take orders and deliver food to customers. A good waiter can also help the customers by recommending the best food in the restaurant or café. Many waiters and waitresses are required by their employers to wear a uniform. Most uniforms used are black and white or all black. Historically the term waiter was used to describe customs officers who waited on the tide for vessels to come in carrying goods to tax.
