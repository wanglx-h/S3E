This became one of the main causes of the slavery. In 1610 a European man called John Rolfe arrived in the United States of Virginia and set up a tobacco farm which made him very rich. Rolfe was the first non-native farmer to use ''nicotiana tabacum'', which is the type of tobacco most commonly smoked today. In the 17th and 18th centuries tobacco made farmers very rich and towns quickly grew in the states of Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina. In 1883 one third of United States tax money came from tobacco. In 1864 the first American tobacco factory opened to produce 20 million cigarettes annually. By 1964 the cigarette contained over 500 added chemicals. Today tobacco manufacturers are still not required by law to list the 500+ ingredients. ==Tobacco and health== Image:Papierosa 1 ubt 0069.jpeg tobacco smoking (especially those who inhale) and people around them (with passive smoking) risk many very serious and often deadly illnesses, such as cancer, strokes, heart disease, and lung disease.
