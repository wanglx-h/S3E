Edinburgh lies on the east coast, where the River Forth flows into the sea. The central part is Edinburgh Castle, at the top of a steep hill. The castle has a military display every year, called a ''tattoo'', where soldiers show their skills at marching and competitions, and there are brass bands and bands of bagpipes. Edinburgh has a very large festival every year, where thousands of performers come to put on shows. The Edinburgh International Festival takes place in August and September. At the same time there is the Edinburgh Fringe. The shows are of all kinds, and range from large ones with famous people, to very small ones by new or unknown actors. The city is served by Edinburgh Airport, and Haymarket and Waverley railway stations. == Old and New towns == The Old Town of Edinburgh is the oldest part of the city, and with the 18th-century New Town, it is a World Heritage Site. It has preserved its mediaeval plan and many Reformation-era buildings. The Old and New Towns are known locally simply as "Town". It is the city centre. The main part of the Old Town is a complex of streets called the Royal Mile while Princes Street is the main business area of the New Town. == Sport == The city's main football teams are Heart of Midlothian F.C. and Hibernian F.C.
