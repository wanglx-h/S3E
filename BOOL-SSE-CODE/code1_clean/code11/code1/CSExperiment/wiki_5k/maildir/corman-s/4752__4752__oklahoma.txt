It had a population of about 3,751,351 people in 2010. The state has a land area of about . Oklahoma is the 28th largest state by population and the 20th largest state by area. The name of the state comes from the Choctaw words ''okla'' and ''humma''. It means "Red People". It is also known by its nickname, ''The Sooner State.'' The state was formed from Indian Territory on November 16, 1907. It was the 46th state to become part of the United States. The people who live in the state are known as ''Oklahomans'' or ''Okies''. The state's capital (city) and largest city is Oklahoma City. In the past, Oklahoma was used as a path for cattle drives, a place for southern wikt:settlers, and a government-made territory for Native Americans. The state is a large producer of Natural Gas, petroleum and food. It has large industry in aviation, energy, telecommunications, and biotechnology. The state has one of the fastest growing economy in the nation. Between 2005 and 2006, it had the third highest percentage of income growth and the highest percentage in gross domestic product growth. Oklahoma City and Tulsa are the main economic areas of Oklahoma. Almost 60 percent of Oklahomans live in these two metropolitan statistical areas. Oklahoma has small mountain ranges, prairies, and eastern forests. Most of Oklahoma is in the Great Plains. It is regularly hit by severe weather. The cultural heritage of Oklahoma is made from by a population descendant from many cultures. These include Germans, Irish people, British people and Native Americans in the United States people. More than 25 Native American languages are spoken in Oklahoma, more than in any other state. Many people in Oklahoma believe in Evangelicalism Christianity. The state is part of the Bible Belt. Oklahoma is one of the most politics conservatism states, and most people vote for the Republican Party (United States). == History == File:Gusher Okemah OK 1922.jpg brought many people to Oklahoma]] Oklahoma has only been a state for a little over a century, but its history is much longer. Arrow heads from the Clovis culture, Native Americans who traveled through Oklahoma, have been found near the city Anadarko, Oklahoma. These arrow heads are about 11,000 years old. The Spiro Mounds Mound Builders Indians were the state's first permanent settlers. In 1541 the Spain explorer Coranado traveled through Oklahoma while in search of the Quivira and Cíbola. During the 1830s, the Five Civilized Tribes were forced to move from the southeastern United States to Indian Territory (now Oklahoma) on the Trail of Tears. During the American Civil War (1861–1865), several Indian tribes sided with the Confederate States of America. The tribes owned slavery. They agreed with the ideas of the states that :wikt:secede from the United States. Also, the tribes were not happy that the federal government did not do what it told them it would do. Not all the tribes sided with the Confederacy. Some tribes had taken control of several forts. This caused much of the Indian Territory to be under Confederate control, but Oklahoma did not become a Confederate state. The Battle of Honey Springs near Fort Gibson, Oklahoma on July 17, 1863 was won by the United States forces. This ended the Confederate control of Indian Territory. On April 22, 1890, the western part of the state was opened to almost 50,000 settlers for the Oklahoma Land Run. During this land run Oklahoma got its nickname, "The Sooner State". The nickname came from the settlers who crossed the territory's borders before the land was opened by the government. A year later, the western part of the territory was turned into Oklahoma territory. The northeastern part, which was home to the Five Civilized Tribes, stayed under the control of the tribes. On November 16, 1907, the western and eastern territories joined together. They became the 46th state of the United States. The newly formed state became an important place for the oil industry. The oil pools in the area caused the population of towns to grow very quickly. Tulsa became known as the "Oil Capital of the World" for most of the 20th century. The oil was a large part of the state's early economy. In 1927, Tulsa businessman Cyrus Avery, known as the "Father of Route 66", began a movement to make U.S. Route 66. Avery used section of highway that was already built between Tulsa and Amarillo, Texas to make the original portion of Highway 66. He was the main person responsible for making the U.S. Highway 66 Association to watch over the building of Route 66. File:Farmer walking in dust storm Cimarron County Oklahoma2.jpg and his two sons during a dust storm in Cimarron County, Oklahoma, 1936]] During the 1930s, northwestern Oklahoma went through a period of time called the Dust Bowl. The area had little rainfall and high temperatures. This caused thousands of farmers to go into poverty and forced them to move to other parts of the United States. From 1930 to 1950, the state saw its only loss in population. It lost 6.9 percent of the people who lived there. Because of the Dust Bowl, the state made hundreds of reservoirs and man-made lakes. By the 1960s, more than 200 man-made lakes had been made. This is the most in the United States. The song ''Oklahoma! (song)'' was made the official song of the state in 1953. The song comes from the 1943 Broadway Musical theater Oklahoma! (musical). The story is set in Oklahoma Territory in 1906 just before Oklahoma became a state. On April 19, 1995, the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City was Oklahoma City Bombing by Timothy McVeigh. 168 people were killed in the bombing. This was the worst terrorism attack in the United States before the World Trade Center attacks on September 11, 2001. McVeigh and his partner, Terry Nichols, were both convicted of the bombing. Some people think other people were involved. McVeigh was later sentenced to death and executed by lethal injection on June 11, 2001. His partner, Nichols, was convicted of 161 counts of first degree murder. Nichols is spending the rest of his life in prison without the chance of being released. === Naming history === The name ''Oklahoma'' comes from the Choctaw phrase ''okla'' ''humma''. This means ''red'' (''humma'') ''people'' (''okla''). Choctaw Tribal chief Allen Wright gave it that name in 1866 during treaty talks with the Federal government of the United States about the use of Indian Territory. He dreamed of an all-Indian state with power held by the United States Superintendent of Indian Affairs. ''Okla humma'' was a phrase in the Choctaw language that meant the same as the English language word ''Indian''. It was used to describe the Native American people all together. ''Oklahoma'' later became the ''de facto'' name for Oklahoma Territory. It was officially accepted in 1890, two years after the area was opened to white settlers. == Geography == File:Oklahoma relief map.png Oklahoma is the 20th-largest state in the United States.
