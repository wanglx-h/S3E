She is one of the first female superheroes in American comic books, and the most famous female superhero in the world. William Moulton Marston, a psychologist who believed that women could be as strong and powerful as men, created Wonder Woman. She was partly inspired by his wife, Elizabeth Holloway-Marston. Wonder Woman first appeared in ''All Star Comics # 8'', published in December 1941. Her first solo comic book, ''Wonder Woman # 1'', was published in the summer of 1942. == Story == In her comic book appearances, Wonder Woman's real name is '''Princess''' '''Diana of Themyscira''', or by her civilian name '''Diana Prince'''. She is the daughter of Hippolyta (DC Comics). Hippolyta is the ruler of the Amazons, a race of peace-loving women who lived on an island named Themyscira (DC Comics) (also referred to as Paradise Island). During World War II, Steve Trevor, a US Air Force pilot, crash-lands on Paradise Island. Diana and the Amazons tend to his wounds and help him recover. Diana decides that she will bring him back to the United States. When she gets there, she becomes the superhero that the world calls ''Wonder Woman''. Her best-known powers are superhuman strength, speed, and reflexes, as well as flight. She has a magic lasso that forces those bound by it to tell the truth, and unbreakable bracelets that can deflect bullets. == Villains == Among her villains, the best known are: * Ares (DC Comics) - the Greek god of war, whose energy and almost infinite powers are fueled by war and hatred among humans * Circe (character) - an ancient sorceress who can transform men into animals * Cheetah (character) - a British archaeologist who has an ancient magical stone that turns her into a Cheetah-like were-woman with incredible speed, reflexes, strength, and thirst for blood * Silver Swan (comics) - a flying villainess whose main power is a very destructive Sound cry * Doctor Psycho - a powerful Psychokinesis man that hates women * Devastation (comics) - a powerful villainess with powers similar to Wonder Woman's; she was created by the Kronos to destroy Wonder Woman and help take over Mount Olympus == In other media == Wonder Woman also appeared in animation cartoons and a live-action television program in the 1970s with actress Lynda Carter. The series made the character very famous. In January 2001, movie producer Joel Silver asked Todd Alcott to write a ''Wonder Woman'' screenplay. Early wikt:rumor listed actor such as Mariah Carey, Sandra Bullock, and Catherine Zeta-Jones to play the role of Wonder Woman. Leonard Goldberg, speaking in a May 2001 interview, named Sandra Bullock as a strong candidate for the project. Bullock said that she was asked to play the role. Lucy Lawless and Chyna were both interested in it. Many screenwriter wrote different versions of the screenplay. By August 2003, Levens was replaced by screenwriter Laeta Kalogridis. In March 2005, Warner Bros. said that Joss Whedon would write and movie director the movie version of ''Wonder Woman.'' Whedon was directing ''Serenity (movie)'' at the time. He needed time to learn Wonder Woman's background. So he did not start writing until late 2005. Silver wanted to film ''Wonder Woman'' in Australia once the script was finished. In May 2005, Whedon said that he would not cast Wonder Woman until he finished the script. Charisma Carpenter{{cite news | author=Matt Mitovitch | url=http://tvguide.com/News/Insider/default.htm?cmsRedir=true&rmDate=09062006&cmsGuid={E882AF71-8A9B-4A2C-8781-2F480C8A38E5}| title= Mars Bombshell Is Still Wonder-ing | publisher=TV Guide | accessdate=September 6, 2006}} and Morena Baccarin said they were interested in the role. In February 2007, Whedon left the project. He said he could not agree with the movie studio about the script. Whedon said that since he was not doing the ''Wonder Woman'' project, he would focus on making his movie ''Goners''. Gal Gadot played Wonder Woman in the 2016 action movie ''Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice''. She played the lead role in the 2017 superhero film ''Wonder Woman (2017 movie)''. She played the role again in ''Justice League (movie)'' (2017), ''Wonder Woman 1984'' (2020), ''Zack Snyder's Justice League'' (2021), ''The Flash (movie)'' and ''Shazam! Fury of the Gods'' (both 2023). ==Honors== On October 21, 2016, the United Nations named Wonder Woman a UN Honorary Ambassador for the Empowerment of Women and Girls. Many people did not like this, because they thought she was an "overtly sexualized image". They wanted the UN to use a real woman instead. Over 45,000 people signed a petition to remove her from the role. The character was dropped from the role two months later. ==Notes== == References == == Other websites == * [http://www.dccomics.com/sites/wonderwoman/ Wonder Woman's Official Website] * [http://dccomics.com/heroes_and_villains/?hv=origin_stories/wonder_woman Wonder Woman's Origin @ DC Comics] * [http://alankistler.squarespace.com/journal/2007/11/21/alan-kistlers-history-of-wonder-woman-part-1.html Alan Kistler's History of Wonder Woman] * [http://www.carolastrickland.com/comics/wwcentral/index.html Carol A.
