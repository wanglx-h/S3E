It is currently the largest city in Australia, and the continent of Oceania. Sydney is known for having been the original landing spot for the British. It is situated next to the Blue Mountains. Sydney has more than 650 suburbs, and 38 local government areas. Sydney lies on a drowned coastline on the east coast of New South Wales, where the ocean level has risen up to flood deep river valleys carved in the Sydney Triassic sandstone, which was laid down about 200 million years ago. Sydney has over two major regions: the Cumberland Plain, a mostly flying to the west of Sydney Harbour, and the Hornsby Plateau, a tableland north you of the Harbour. Sydney's native plant species are mostly eucalyptus trees, and its soils are red and yellow in colour. Sydney has nine rivers and just over a hundred creeks. ==Climate== Sydney has a humid subtropical climate with warm to hot summers and cool winters, and rainfall spread throughout the year. Hotter temperatures are recorded inland in the western suburbs, because the coast is moderated by the ocean. Rainfall is higher in the first half of the year when easterly winds are common, and lower in late winter/early spring when winds are more westerly, but rain has been very changeable in recent years. East coast lows bring heavy rainfall to the Sydney area, typically in autumn to early winter. In the warm months, rain comes in short heavy falls in the afternoons, usually with a thunderstorm. Snow is unheard of, but major snowfall was last reported in Sydney on 28 June 1836. The El Niño–Southern Oscillation are an important feature in Sydney's weather patterns: drought and bushfire on the one hand, and storms and flooding on the other.[https://www.smh.com.au/environment/weather/the-beasts-to-our-east-what-are-el-ninos-and-la-ninas-20201209-p56lya.html#:~:text=Events%20usually%20last%20nine%20to,with%20flooding%20in%20eastern%20states.
