The '''spelling''' used in the Simple English Wikipedia can be the spelling of any valid version of English. Two common versions are British English and American English. Different spellings should not be mixed in an article. It will look bad if one spelling is mixed with another. So, for example, if an article begins using British English spellings, it should use British English for the whole article. It is best to write in the spelling you are used to. If you write in a spelling you aren't used to, you might not know that the grammar is also different sometimes. == Other websites == *[http://arssemantica.atspace.com/BrE/britspelling.htm British Spelling standards] *[http://www.luther.ca/~dave7cnv/cdnspelling/cdnspelling.html Dave VE7CNV's Truly Canadian Dictionary of Canadian Spelling]
