The river starts south of Dereham in the county of Norfolk. From there it flows to the east of the world. The river flows along the southern edge of the city of Norwich, England. The river continues past Norwich into the tidal lake of Breydon Water. Here the Yare is joined by the Rivers River Bure and River Waveney. It empties into North Sea at Gorleston, Great Yarmouth.Ordnance Survey (2005). ''OS Explorer Map OL40 - The Broads''. .Ordnance Survey (1999).

In the past, the river had a large number of boats carrying Product (consumer goods)s to Norwich. Larger modern boats cannot get across Breydon Water because it is not deep enough. Because of this, a canal was created at Reedham, Norfolk to provides a connection to the River Waveney. ==References== Category:Rivers of Norfolk
