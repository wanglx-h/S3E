User:Archer7 15:19, 6 April 2006 (UTC) * Well-covered on the main en: Wikipedia and others. Doesn't strike me as a core subject of global interest (Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#What Simple English Wikipedia is not). -- User:Netoholic User talk:Netoholic 21:58, 17 February 2006 (UTC) ** Personally, I think that Simple should keep articles that could be useful at some point. For example, if we targeted this project more towards schools and perhaps those with learning difficulties that article could be useful. However, if we ''are'' scrapping all the articles that aren't core subjects, delete :Category:Television series. User:Archer7 22:05, 17 February 2006 (UTC) *** I find it interesting that we have articles about so many TV series, yet still do not have a Television series article. This is a prime example of the failure of this project to have clear direction. It has Special:Whatlinkshere/Everybody Loves Raymond and is readily covered on the main Wikipedias that cover the region it is important to. Does this article hold any value to someone in China? Is it taught about in any school? Simple does not need to cover all subjects, and we do not need to be held to the rules of the main Wikipedias. Let's make a high-quality encyclopedia geared towards students of English and as an aid to translators who are creating other Wikipedias in their native language. -- User:Netoholic User talk:Netoholic 04:13, 18 February 2006 (UTC) **** I couldn't agree more about this project lacking direction, and I suppose you're right about that kind of article. I think if we continued to remove articles like this we would lose about 2000 articles, which perhaps wouldn't be such a bad thing. Maybe the community needs to discuss where this project is going, so everyone has a clear view. Articles wildly vary in simplification, so people don't know what to expect from an article here, we need more guidelines for articles. User:Archer7 10:56, 18 February 2006 (UTC) ** '''Keep'''. Same song, second verse. Deleting articles because they are not "core" articles is not useful. I have no great burden to have an "Everybody Loves Raymond" article on this wikipedia (nor will I feel lugubrious if/when it is deleted), but it should stay out of principle. Limiting what articles we ''allow'' is much too restrictive on the editors. Even using words like "allow" shows the overrestrictive nature of the idea. We are not a private club, no, not even here on Simple English Wikipedia. That is what "open-source" means. Whatever happened to w:en:Wikipedia:Assume good faith, etc.? If editors want to make an article and it isn't vandalism or propaganda, etc., it certainly does no harm. As far as the "television series" article, if there were one, it would not bother me, but if I were writing it, I would put it as a section under television until there was enough material to be worth a separate article (if that ever happened). That would also be following precedent. Giving a project direction is one thing. Things like "Collaboration of the Week" and "Translation of the Week" do that. Forcing people to do something (or not do something) is another. As a suggestion, editors who feel strongly about having core articles perhaps should spend more time writing core articles and less time requesting that valid "non-core" articles be deleted. Note: I do not intend this vote/comment as a personal attack nor am I trying to offend anyone. --User:Cromwellt|User talk:Cromwellt 16:57, 19 February 2006 (UTC) *** To be honest, I'm not sure. I agree with Cromwellt, but I'd also like to see much more of a focus on the core articles, until we get going. We need a big discussion to see where we should go with this project. User:Archer7 17:02, 19 February 2006 (UTC) ****I would love to be a part of such a discussion. And I have no problem with a focus on core articles. I even am interested in writing some of them myself. I feel that our preferences are not mutually exclusive if we are willing to be fair and act in good faith. As a preliminary proposition, how about we make notices in prominent places like the Community portal that say that '''as we are still starting''' or '''until we grow''' we encourage a focus on Wikipedia:core article. But it is important a)that this is stated as (and really is) ''temporary'', b) that this is stated as (and really is) ''encouragement'', not ''requirement'', c) that people are not prohibited from working on/creating other valid but non-core articles, and d) that deletion of valid but non-core articles stops. If it is truly non-notable (not just "non-notable for SEWikipedia", because that is just another way of saying "non-core"), or almost any other reason except "non-core", deletion of articles is a valid and important process (which should generally be democratic as a reflection of consensus). As an expression of good faith, I volunteer to write the article on what a core article is, and I will include a statement of encouragement as above. I will also make a page on Wikipedia:Project direction where we can talk about all of this. How does that sound? Let's work out a compromise if at all possible. --User:Cromwellt|User talk:Cromwellt 16:35, 23 February 2006 (UTC) ***** Sounds great, make it Wikipedia talk:Project direction. I agree with all of that. User:Archer7 16:39, 23 February 2006 (UTC) ****** I'd prefer if we just make the discussion on Wikipedia:Simple talk for now. Create a new topic section. -- User:Netoholic User talk:Netoholic 17:57, 23 February 2006 (UTC) *'''Weak keep'''. There are several of our TV series articles that are less notable than Raymond, but I don't think we want to spend the time to deliberate the various merits of articles within the set. In principle, it probably would have been better if none of them had been created, but the project seems more focused now, so as a practical matter I don't want us bogged down in mitigating past problems. I also think there are video/computer games we have that are even less notable than any of the TV series; then there's the pop-singer-du-jours, etc. If we do want such holistic discussions, I'd start lower.

'''Neutral''', per comments by Archer7. An explanation of a nomination is usually a good thing and increases the chances that the article will actually be deleted. I don't see the current harm (it is valuable information, even if it isn't a core article), and I see future usefulness. It is actually copied from :en:List of modern weapons by type, rather than where it links. There are minor differences, but that could be because of an update to the English page or minor simplification. Either way, the article/list could still use some simplification/explanation, but that's not a reason for a delete, it's a reason for simplification. --User:Cromwellt|User talk:Cromwellt 21:11, 15 March 2006 (UTC) *'''Delete'''.

While she may be more notable than other articles we've kept, a self-promoting vanity article is still a self-promoting vanity article. If it does get deleted (we seem to be somewhat divided on this at the moment), and someone else rewrites the article (not she herself), I will not try to delete it again. But when it is written by the subject, that's vanity, period. See: :en:Wikipedia:Vanity.

For what it's worth, I generally agree with the Wikipedia guidelines on vanity pages and autobiographical edits. I've written dozens of articles and accomplished thousands of Wikipedia edits, and I've reverted plenty of vandalism and pounced on plenty of bonafide vanity pages. In this case though, my intent was not to have a vanity page, but to ''translate'' a page that already existed on the English wikipedia. I have helped out with other "Simple English" pages, at least one of which linked to an "Elonka Dunin" page, so I created a minimal stub page here in as neutral a manner as I could manage. If anyone feels the information is not neutral, then by all means, feel free to change it, or challenge anything you want on the talk page, and I'll back up anything there.

If the had asked me on my talk page to write a page for her (particularly if she mentioned that she had a page on English Wikipedia which was kept after a delete nomination), I probably would have done it, and I wouldn't have nominated it for deletion if someone else had done it, either.

This page was kept amid a mixed reaction four months ago when I nominated it for deletion the first time. I am now renominating it for these five reasons: 1) I have copied all relevant information (including abbreviations, sources, and external links) to Wikipedia:Word list abbreviations, so there is nothing there of value which is not somewhere else more appropriate; 2) it has been four months since the previous nomination for deletion (plenty of time for things to change); 3) the wikt:Main Page is well on its way and has taken over the functions of that page; 4) consensus states (see Wikipedia:Simple talk#Project direction and Wikipedia talk:Simple English Wikipedia) that we should link to the Simple English Wiktionary, which basically makes this list obsolete; and 5) the list has not grown or even been modified since 04:29, 23 December 2005 (not counting vandalism or the deletion tag addition and removal), not even during or after the previous discussion here on RfD. If someone who voted ''keep'' had started adding to the list, I could understand keeping it in the hopes that it might become useful someday, but since no one has, this shows that the page is not going anywhere, and it is useless in its current form. As mentioned earlier, it has also been superseded by Simple English Wiktionary. It was an idea that was started but never got very far, and then another idea took its place.

You should put notices on the pages you wish to delete (so that the writers know what's going on) and then vote on them as a group. -- User:Ricky81682 (User talk:Ricky81682) 18:06, 29 July 2005 (UTC) ** '''Keep''' though I aggree with Ricky81682 about the proceadure England is connected with football across the world and so people may well come to simple english wikipedia to learn about it, might be an idea to categorise them by country though --User:Sim 16:26, 7 August 2005 (UTC) (whch I have now done, as well as making better stubs out of a few of them.) ** Also agree with Ricky, anything wanting to be deleted should go through procedure and let people have their say, not just delete them with no warning. (From the looks of things we have already had a spate of things deleted without warning). User:BallSack 23:00, 26 August 2005 (UTC) **For any article that is a substub, '''don't delete''' them but turn them into '''redirect'''s to "List of :en:Foo football teams" (e.g. List of English football teams). If there are any articles that are large stubs (>6 sentences) or are no longer stubs, '''then keep''' and no redirect. User:BlankVerse 04:25, 27 September 2005 (UTC) **I think there is a way to solve this problem: for the small/unknown teams, do just a list by country; for the big ones (Real Madrid, Arsenal, Santos, etc), do a normal article. (I remember you: some teams like Manchester (UK) and Corinthians (BR)have historical and cultural importance. -- User:Aflm 01:52, 30 October 2005 (UTC) **Ok, so what's happening here? User:Aurora 15:58, 30 December 2005 (UTC) **I think it is obvious from this vote (which has been here since last ''July'') that most people think the longer stubs should be '''kept''' and that sub-stubs should be '''redirected''' to a list (as long as the teams are not of historical or other importance). Once someone implements most or all of this, let's get this vote off this page and into the log, shall we? --User:Cromwellt|User talk:Cromwellt 18:46, 28 April 2006 (UTC) **'''Move''', if it is a list. —Preceding Wikipedia:Signatures comment added by User:Tdxiang (User talk:Tdxiang#top • Special:Contributions/Tdxiang) 08:01, 3 May 2006 (UTC) **Frankly, I admittedly know nothing about Association Football, but I guess I'll try to see what I can do. -- User:Ricky81682 (User talk:Ricky81682) 08:34, 3 June 2006 (UTC) == September 2006 == === Eleanor of Aquitaine === Removed the section which advertised a book for sale.
