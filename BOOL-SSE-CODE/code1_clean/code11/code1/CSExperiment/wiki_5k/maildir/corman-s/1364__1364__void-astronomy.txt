File:Nearsc.gif In astronomy, '''voids''' are the empty spaces between filament (astronomy). Filaments and voids are the largest-scale structures in the Universe. There are no or few galaxy in voids. Most voids have a diameter of 11 to 150 parsec. Especially large voids are the empty spaces without many superclusters. These voids are sometimes called '''supervoids'''. A 1994 official counting lists a total of 27 supervoids with a distance of up to 740 Mpc.Lindner U, J. Einasto, M. Einasto, W. Freudling, K. Fricke, E. Tago. 1995. ''The structure of supervoids. I.
