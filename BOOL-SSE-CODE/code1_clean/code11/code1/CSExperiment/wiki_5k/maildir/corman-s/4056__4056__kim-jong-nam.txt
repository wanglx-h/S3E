'''Kim Jong-nam''' (May 10, 1971 - February 13, 2017) was the eldest son of Kim Jong-il, the former leader of North Korea. He tried to enter Japan using a fake passport in May 2001. This was to visit Tokyo Disneyland. This caused his father to not approve of him.''Huffington Post'' article: "[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/06/08/kim-jongnam-north-korean-_n_604779.html Kim Jong Nam, North Korean Leader's Son, Denies Plans To Defect]." Kim Jong-nam's younger half-brother Kim Jong-un was made the heir in September 2010.''Christian Science Monitor'' article: "[http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-Pacific/2010/1008/Kim-Jong-un-confirmed-North-Korean-heir-ahead-of-massive-military-parade Kim Jong-un confirmed North Korean heir ahead of massive military parade]." In June 2010, Kim Jong-nam gave a brief interview to the ''Associated Press'' in Macau.''Seattle Times'' article: "[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2012048945_apasskoreashipsinks.html NKorean leader's son gives interview]." He told the reporter that he had "no plans" to defect to Europe. The press had recently said this. Kim Jong-nam lived in an apartment on the southern tip of Macau's Coloane Island until 2007. An anonymous South Korean official reported in October 2010 that Jong-nam had not lived in Macau for "months", and now goes between China and "another country." When his father died, Kim Jong-nam did not attend the funeral. This was to avoid rumours on the succession. He was assassination in Malaysia on February 13, 2017, which is believed to be ordered by his half-brother Kim Jong-un. ==Personal life== The South Korean newspaper ''The Chosun Ilbo'' said that Kim Jong-nam has polygamy, at least one Mistress (lover), and several children.''Chosun Ilbo'' article: "[http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2010/10/04/2010100401059.html Where Is Kim Jong-il's Eldest Son?]." His first wife Shin Jong-hui (born circa 1980) and their son Kum-sol (born c. 1996) live at a home called Dragon Villa on the northern outskirts of Beijing. His second wife Lee Hye-kyong (born c. 1970), their son Han-sol (born c. 1995) and their daughter Sol-hui (born c. 1998) live in an apartment building in Macau. Jong-nam's mistress, former Air Koryo flight attendant So Yong-la (born c. 1980), also lives in Macau. Jong-nam is often given attention by the media for his gambling and extravagant spending. ==References== Category:1971 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Assassinated people Category:North Korean politicians
