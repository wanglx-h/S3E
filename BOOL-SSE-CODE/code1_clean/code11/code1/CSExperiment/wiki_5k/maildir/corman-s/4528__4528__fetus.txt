Subject: Fetus
A '''fetus''' or '''foetus''' is the stage that an organism goes through before it is born as a baby. In humans a fetus is the stage (time of development) after the embryonic stage, and begins during the third to eighth week of development after fertilization of the egg. The fetal stage lasts from 8 weeks after fertilization to birth. This stage can also take 9-12 weeks where the risk of any birth defects happening is increased. == Society and culture == Many countries consider the fetus to be a wikt:delicacy. It has happened in times of famine, in some parts of the world, where they were consumed. Sometimes it is served straight after the abortion. Other cultures consider the placenta (afterbirth), which comes out after the fetus in the placental expulsion, to be edible. However most say that it is not healthy or beneficial, and is also unsafe. The afterbirth might contain harmful bacteria which might be harmful to the person eating it, causing them to get illness. However these are probably removed during cooking. Other health organisations, such as Health Canada, say that it is not beneficial. The placenta, which comes after the fetus, is cooked more often in the developed world, which do not typically practise those types of intentional abortions. It is said to contain a lot of vitamins and minerals. The placenta is covered in and full of blood, which the fetus has used. Placenta is usually boiled or eaten raw. It is also ground up and taken in capsule form. == References == Category:Biological reproduction category:Pregnancy and childbirth
