He painted about 300 different paintings. He originally worked as a Advertisement artist. He designed things like advertisements and window displays for Shop. He soon became famous as an artist in the Pop Art movement, in which everyday objects and media images were used. One of his most famous paintings is his colourful portrait of American movie star, Marilyn Monroe. After she died, he was deeply moved and wanted to create some sort of memorial. In 1968, Warhol was shot by Valerie Solanas. He was known for his The Factory studio in New York City where most of his work was created. In 1987, Warhol was in a hospital in New York City after an operation on his gallbladder. He died in his sleep from a sudden post-operative cardiac arrhythmia, aged 58. His family sued the hospital for inadequate care, saying that the arrhythmia was caused by improper care and water poisoning. ==References== ==Other websites== * [https://www.adams.ie/95252/ANDY-WARHOL-1928-1987-Mother-and-Child-Screenprint-on-lenox-museum-board-91-4-x-91-4cm-Signed-year-of-work-1986-edition-pp-12/15-aside-from-edition-of-250-95252?high_estimate=15000&ipp=10&keyword=60&low_estimate=500&view=lot_detail Andy Warhol Print at Adam's Auctioneers] * [http://www.warholfoundation.org/ Warhol Foundation] in New York City * [http://www.warhol.org/ Andy Warhol Collection in Pittsburgh] * [http://www.warhol.org/collection/archives Time Capsules: the Andy Warhol Collection] * [http://www.contemporaryartdaily.com/tag/andy-warhol/ Documentation of recent exhibitions of work by Andy Warhol] * [http://www.ubu.com/sound/warhol.html The work of Andy Warhol] spoken about by David Cronenberg on UbuWeb * * [http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/46784,in-pictures,news-in-pictures,in-pictures-andy-warhol-exhibition-in-paris Warhol in Paris] —slideshow by ''The First Post'' * [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oqUd8utr14 Andy Warhol makes a digital painting of Debbie Harry at the Commodore Amiga product launch press conference in 1985] * [https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/andy-warhol/a-documentary-film/44 Andy Warhol: A Documentary film] by Ric Burns for Public Broadcasting Service Category:Andy Warhol Category:American crime victims Category:LGBT people from Pennsylvania Category:American painters Category:Pop artists Category:Deaths from surgical complications Category:Deaths from cardiac arrhythmia Category:Gay men Category:LGBT artists Category:People from Pittsburgh Category:1928 births Category:1987 deaths
