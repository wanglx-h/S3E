There are two city in Somerset. They are Bath (city) and Wells. ==History== The name "Somerset" comes from the Anglo-Saxon phrase ''Sumorsaete,'' which was used to describe people from Somerton. In the past, the northern border of Somerset was the River Avon, Bristol. However, as the city of Bristol has grown, the border moved south. In 1974 parts of north Somerset, the city of Bristol and parts of south Gloucestershire were joined into a new county. This county was named Avon (county). In 1996 Avon was split into 4 parts, which are now unitary authority. People usually say that 2 of these parts (named North Somerset and Bath and North East Somerset) are part of Somerset, even though they have their own councils. The oldest prison in England which is still used is in a town named Shepton Mallet in Somerset. Somerset also has the world's oldest road which people built. It is called the Sweet Track; it was built in about 3800 BC. ==Industry and tourism== Image:Somerset.dunster.arp.750pix.jpg Yarn Market was built in 1609 for the trade of local cloth]] There is not much large industry in Somerset, but Bridgwater is a port, and Yeovil is important in building helicopters. Tourism is an important industry in the county; in 2001 about 23,000 people worked in tourism. Tourists like Somerset because it is very beautiful, with much countryside and few big towns.
