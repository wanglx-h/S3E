The '''grizzly bear''' (''Ursus arctos horribilis''), also known as the '''North American brown bear''' or simply '''grizzly''', is a large subspecies of the brown bear that lives in North America. Grizzly bears were almost hunted to extinction in the United States because they were seen as a threat. In the late 20th century and early 21st century, rules were made to protect grizzly bears. Grizzly bears eat a lot of different foods, including fish, fruit, berries, and other animals (such as squirrels, moose, and deer). Grizzly bears sometimes eat crops, livestock, and human food. == References == Category:Bears Category:Mammals of North America
