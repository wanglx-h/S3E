Subject: Programming language
A '''programming language''' is a type of written language that tells computers what to do. Examples are: Python (programming language), Ruby (programming language), Java (programming language), JavaScript, C (programming language), C++, and C Sharp (programming language). Programming languages are used to write computer programs and computer software. A programming language is like a set of commands that tell the computer how to do things. Usually, the programming language uses real words for some of the commands (e.g. "if... then... else...", "and", "or"), so that the language is easier for a human to understand. Like any normal language, many programming languages use punctuation. To make a program, a programmer writes commands in their chosen programming language and saves the commands to a text file. This text file is called source code. Some programming languages, such as Python and JavaScript, can be read by the computer right away. If not, the source code has to be compiled, which means that the computer translation the source code into another language (such as assembly languageMazidi, M. A., & Mazidi, J. G. (1997). 80x86 IBM PC and Compatible Computers: Assembly Language, Design, and Interfacing; Volume I and II. Prentice Hall PTR.Irvine, K. R. (2003). Assembly language for Intel-based computers. Prentice Hall. or machine language) that a computer can read, but which is much harder for a person to read. Computer programs must be written very carefully. If a programmer makes mistakes, then the program might then stop working, which is called "crashing". When a program has a problem because of how the code was written, this is called a "Software bug". A very small mistake can cause very serious bugs. == Types of programming languages == There are many types of programming languages. Most programming languages do not follow one type alone, so it is difficult to assign a type for each language. The examples of each type are given in each section below because they are the best well-known examples of that type. === High-level vs. low-level === High-level programming languages require less knowledge about the hardware compared to low-level programming languages. This is because high-level programming languages abstract away the hardware the program is running on. Many high-level languages require an Interpreter_(computing) to run the source code on the hardware in real time. On the other hand, low-level languages usually convert the whole source code to machine code before running, because the source code is so close to the hardware that it is easy to do so. === Declarative vs. Imperative programming === ''Declarative'' programming languagesLloyd, J. W. (1994, September). Practical Advtanages of Declarative Programming. In GULP-PRODE (1) (pp. 18-30). describe a "problem" but they usually do not say how the problem should be solved. The problem description uses logic, and "solving" the problem often looks like automatically proving a system of logical axioms. Examples for such programming languages are Prolog,Clocksin, W. F., & Mellish, C. S. (2012). Programming in Prolog: Using the ISO standard. Springer Science & Business Media.Sterling, L., & Shapiro, E. Y. (1994).

MIT Press. and SQL.Hursch, C. J., Hursch, J. L., & Hursch, C. J. (1988). SQL, the Structured Query Language. Tab Books. ''Imperative'' programming languages describe a system of state changes. At the start, the program is in a certain ''state'', and the computer is given steps to follow, in order to perform an action. Following the steps causes the program to "change state". In general, declarative programming languages are safer and shorter. Imperative programming languages are more common, because they are easier to use. === Functional vs. Procedural === Functional programmingBird, R. S., & Wadler, P. L. (1988). Functional programming. Prentice Hall.Wadler, P. (1992, February). The essence of functional programming. In Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGPLAN-SIGACT symposium on Principles of programming languages (pp. 1-14). looks at programming like a Function (mathematics) in mathematics. The program receives ''input'', together with some information, and uses this information to create ''output''. It will not have a state in between, and it will also not change things that are not related to the computation. Procedural programs specify or describe sets of steps or state changes. === Stack-based === Stack (data structure) languages look at some of the program's memory like a stack of cards. There are very few things that can be done with a stack. A Information item can be put on the top of the stack. This operation is generally called "push". A data item can be removed from the top of the stack. This is called a "pop". You can look at the item at the top of the stack without removing it. This is called a "peek". If a program is written as "push 5; push 3; add; pop;" it will put 5 on the top of the stack, put 3 on top of the 5, add the top two values (3 + 5 = 8), replace the 3 and 5 with the 8, and print the top (8). Examples for programming languages that are stack-based are the languages PostscriptGeschke, C. M. (1986).

AI magazine, 6(4). place data and ''functions'' that change data into a single unit. This unit is called an "object". Objects can interact with each other and change another object's data. This is usually called encapsulation or information hiding.Petitcolas, F. A., Anderson, R. J., & Kuhn, M. G. (1999). Information hiding-a survey. Proceedings of the IEEE, 87(7), 1062-1078. Most modern programming languages are object-oriented, or at least allow this style of programming. Examples of this are Java programming language,Campione, M., & Walrath, K. (1998).

A single component can be part of different "programs", without the need to be changed internally. === Scientific computing === Some of the languages above can be used for scientific computing.

These include: * Correct numbers (types of numbers, and how large or small the numbers can be) * Words (reserved words, case-sensitivity) * Limits on what the programming language can do Most languages have official '''standards''' that define the rules of how to write the source code. Some programming languages have two or more standards. This can happen when a new standard replaces an old one. For example, the Perl 5Till, D., & Till, D. (1996). Teach yourself Perl 5 in 21 days. Sams Pub.. standard replaced Perl 4 in 1993. It can happen because two people made two standards at the same time. For example, there are several standards for APL. == Object-Oriented Programming == '''Object-Oriented Programming''' (sometimes shortened to OOP) is a form of programming where all parts of the program are objects. Objects are pieces of memory with the same structure that can be used again and again. A bank account, bitmap, or hero from a video game could all be objects within a program. Objects are made up of '''properties''' (pieces of information the object stores) and '''methods''' which are things the object can do. A Dog object might have properties like height and hairColor. Its methods might include bark() and wagTail(). All objects are created from templates called classes. You can think of a class as a mold from which objects are made. The class defines all the properties and methods that its objects will have. Objects created from a class are called '''instances''' of the class. A class can ''extend'' another class, which means that it takes all the properties and methods of the class but can add its own. Here is an example of what a class might look like in a programming language: class Dog extends Mammal { // These are properties: String breed = "Collie" String type = "Herding Dog" // These are methods void wagTail() { //Do some wagging } void bark() { // Do the barking here } } Notice that the Dog class extends the Mammal class, so all dogs will have the properties of a mammal, like hairLength, and methods, like eat() or sleep(). Object-oriented programming is used in many of today's most popular programming languages, such as Java programming language, C# programming language, Objective-C,Kochan, S. G. (2011).

John Wiley & Sons.): Dim Input Input = InputBox("How old are you?? - Code") If Not IsNumeric(Input) Then MsgBox & Input & "That's not a number!" ElseIf Input 100 Then MsgBox "That's old!" Else MsgBox "You're " & Input & " years old." End If This program asks the user his or her age and responds based on what the user typed. If the user typed something that is not a number, the program says so. If the user typed a number less than zero, the program says so. If the user says he or she is older than 100 years old, the program says "That's old!". If the user typed a correct age, the program says back to the user how old he or she is. === Example of Python === Here is a program that does the same thing as the program above, but in Python (programming language): try: age = int(raw_input("How old are you? ")) except ValueError: print ("That's not a number!") else: if age 100: print ("That's old!") else: print("You're %s years old." % age) === Example of C# === The same thing as the program above, but in C Sharp (programming language): using System; public class Hello { public static void Main() { Console.WriteLine("What is your age?"); int age; if (!int.TryParse(Console.ReadLine(), out age)) Console.WriteLine("That's not a number!"); else if (age 100) Console.WriteLine("That's old!"); else Console.WriteLine("You're {0} years old.", age); } } === Example of Haskell === The same thing again, but in Haskell (programming language): import Text.Read main = do putStrLn "What is your age?" input "You cannot be less than zero years old!" | age > 100 -> "That's old!" | otherwise -> "You're " ++ show age ++ " years old." Nothing -> "That's not a number!" == References == == Related pages == * Algorithm * Formal language * List of programming languages * Programmer * Compiler * Computer programming * Programming paradigm * Pseudocode Category:Programming languages
