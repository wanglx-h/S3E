In the United States, movies have become an enormous part of the economy. The industry has always been led by a few major movie studios like Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer/United Artists, Warner Bros., Sony Pictures, Paramount Pictures, or Disney. The oldest American movie studio is Universal Studios. ===Elements=== There are many large companies that provide all of the services needed to make movies, such as Special effect, lighting, and Set construction companies.

They rarely make a lot of money, but if they are successful, the big studios will quickly try to get the people involved to sign a contract with them, by offering them a lot of money to make another movie. == The Oscars == Some movies receive Academy Award nominations, which normally reflect on the qualities of a film's production process.
