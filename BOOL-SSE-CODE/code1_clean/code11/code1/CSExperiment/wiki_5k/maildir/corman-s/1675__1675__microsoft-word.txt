Many of the ideas and features in Microsoft Word came from '''Bravo''', the first GUI writing program. Microsoft bought the Bravo program, and changed its name to ''Microsoft Word''. When it first came out, it was not very popular, and did not sell as well as other writing programs like WordPerfect. Although it was not very popular when it came out, it had a feature called ''WYSIWYG'' (What You See Is What You Get), which meant that people can change the visual style of writing (e.g. bold, italics), by selecting and formatting text, when in other programs like WordPerfect, people had to add special 'codes' to change the style of writing. ''WYSIWYG'' is now a common feature of all computer writing programs. === Versions === There are versions for Microsoft Word for other operating systems as well as Microsoft Windows.

When the user sent his document to a friend, the friend needed a copy of Microsoft Word to read the document. Then that friend would probably also save documents in the same secret format of Word. This gave Microsoft Word a dominant position. == Other websites == * [http://www.officeword.com Official website] * www.office.com Category:Microsoft Office Category:Word processors
