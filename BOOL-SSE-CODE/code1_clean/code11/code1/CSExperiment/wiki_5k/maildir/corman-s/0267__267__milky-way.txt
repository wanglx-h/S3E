It contains around 400 billion stars, including our Sun. The Milky Way has a diameter of as measured using the D25isophote, and is a barred spiral galaxy. The idea that the Milky Way is made of stars goes back to the Ancient Greek philosopher Democritus. The Milky Way has three main parts: a ''disk'', where the Solar System is, a ''bulge'' at the core, and an outer ''halo'' all around it. Although the word "disk" suggests it is flat, the Milky Way is actually not quite flat. It is slightly warped and twisted.Ghosh, Pallab 2019. Milky Way galaxy is warped and twisted, not flat. ''BBC News'' Science & Environment. [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-49182184] This galaxy belongs to the Local Group of three large galaxies and over 50 smaller galaxies. The Milky Way is one of the largest galaxies in the group, second to the Andromeda Galaxy. Its closest neighbour is the Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy, which is about 25,000 light years away from the Earth. The Andromeda Galaxy is moving towards the Milky Way Galaxy and will collide with it in about 3.75 billion years.NASA 2012. NASA's Hubble shows Milky Way is destined for head-on collision. [http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/science/milky-way-collide.html NASA - NASA's Hubble shows Milky Way is destined for head-on collision] The Andromeda Galaxy moves with a speed of about 1,800 kilometer per minute. Origin: "Two of the Milky Way's earliest building blocks" are known; Shakti (disambiguation and Shiva (disambiguation) seem "to be (left-overs or) remnants of two galaxies that (were joined or) merged ... with an early version of the Milky Way"; That seems to have happened "between 12 and 13 billion years ago";.https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/03/240321155515.htm. Retrieved 2024-04-11 ==Size== The stellar disk of the Milky Way Galaxy is about 200,000 light-years (9×1017km) in diameter, and is considered to be, on average, about 1000 light years thick. It is estimated to contain at least 100billion stars, and possibly up to 400billion stars. The figure depends on the number of very low-mass, or dwarf stars, which are hard to detect, especially more than 300 light years from our sun. Therefore, present estimates of the total number are uncertain. This can be compared to the one trillion (1012) stars of the neighbouring Andromeda Galaxy. The stellar disc of the Milky Way does not have a sharp edge, a radius beyond which there are no stars. Rather, the number of stars drops smoothly with distance from the centre of the Galaxy. Beyond a radius of about 40,000 light years, the number of stars drops much faster, for reasons that are not understood. Extending beyond the stellar disk is a much thicker disk of gas. Observations indicate that the gaseous disk of the Milky Way has a thickness of around 12000 light years–twice the previously accepted value. At 220kilometers per second it takes the Solar System about 240 million years to complete one orbit of the Galaxy (a galactic year). The Galactic halo extends outward but is limited in size by the orbits of two Milky Way satellites, the Large and the Small Magellanic Clouds, whose Apsis is at about 180,000 light years. At this distance or beyond, the orbits of most halo objects would be disrupted by the Magellanic Clouds, and the objects would likely be ejected from the vicinity of the Milky Way. As a guide to the relative physical scale of the Milky Way, if the Solar System out to the orbit of Pluto were reduced to the size of a quarter (U.S. coin) (about an inch or 25 mm in diameter), the Milky Way would have a diameter of 2,000 kilometers. == Galactic center == File:Milky Way Spiral Arm.svg File:Milky Way Arms ssc2008-10.svg is in the Orion–Cygnus Arm.]] The galactic disc, which bulges outward at the galactic center, has a diameter of 170–200,000 light years.David freeman (May 25,2018) " The Milky way might be much bigger than thought " The exact distance from the Sun to the galactic center is debated.

However, Hera wakes up while she is breastfeeding the baby and realizes she is nursing a baby she does not know. According to Greek mythology, she then pushes the baby away and a stream of her milk sprays the night sky, making a wikt:faint band of light known as the Milky Way. == Related pages == * Galaxy * Local Group * List of galaxies * Andromeda galaxy * Whirlpool galaxy * IC 1101 == References == * Category:Milky Way
