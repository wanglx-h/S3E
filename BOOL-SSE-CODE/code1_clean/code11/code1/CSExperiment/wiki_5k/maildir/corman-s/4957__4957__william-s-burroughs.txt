He was a :wikt:contemporary and friend of writers Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac. Burroughs was a member of the family who owned the Burroughs Cash Register Company. A family :wikt:trust paid him an income, so he did not have to work a regular job. Sometimes he lived in Mexico and other countries, because he could live there in more :wikt:luxury than in the United States. One favorite apartment he had in New York City was a windowless basement, nicknamed "Bill's Bunker" by his friends. Many of them were emerging writers and artists. Burroughs told interesting, wikt:colorful stories, but did not think he could be a writer. This changed as he came to terms with tragedy; he had killed his common law wife Joan, in an accident when they were both drunkenness. Burroughs began to write to work through his :wikt:grief and feelings of Guilt (emotion). He also abused drugs, including heroin, and it affected his writing. His first novel, ''Naked Lunch'', was a Surrealism work. Besides writing, Burroughs also recorded spoken word and musical works. One of his works paired him with musician Kurt Cobain.Metzger, R., [https://dangerousminds.net/comments/when_kurt_cobain_met_william_burroughs "When Kurt Cobain Met William Burroughs"] , ''Dangerous Minds'', October 26, 2012.
