The population as of 2021 was 85,279. The city was founded in 546 AD. It has old :en:Derry_city_walls which are still complete. The city is in County Londonderry, near the border with the Republic of Ireland's County Donegal. ==History== The city was originally called ''Doire'' (pronounced ''duhruh'') which is an Gaelic word for a group of oak trees. In English language, this word became "Derry". After the Plantation of Ulster, the :en:The_Honourable_The_Irish_Society gave money for the building of the :en:Londonderry_Port and walls in Derry. In 1984 the city council changed the name of the local government area back to its original title of Derry but the city's official name is still Londonderry.[http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/nie/cases/NIHC/QB/2007/5.html&query=title+(+Derry+)&method=boolean ''Derry City Council, Re Application for Judicial Review &#91;2007&#93; NIQB 5 (25 January 2007)''], http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/6297907.stm The city has long been subject to controversy over its name. Amongst the majority Catholicism and Irish republicanism population of Northern Ireland, the city is referred to as Derry, truer to the original Irish word ''Doire'' and aligned with the view of the Republic of Ireland, where traffic signs and popular opinion labels the city similarly. Amongst the majority Protestantism and Ulster loyalism population, the city is called Londonderry. This disagreement over naming causes the title "Derry/Londonderry" to be used in cross-community instances, giving rise to the somewhat sarcastic nickname, "Stroke City". == References == Category:6th-century establishments in Europe Category:Cities in Northern Ireland Category:Establishments in Northern Ireland Category:County towns in Northern Ireland Category:County Londonderry
