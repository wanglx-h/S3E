File:Cube.svg File:Selpologne.jpg A '''cube''' is a type of polyhedron with all right angles and whose height, width and depth are all the same. It is a type of cuboid, which is itself a type of hexahedron. A cube is one of the simplest Platonic solids in space. Something that is shaped like a cube can be called ''cubic''. Surface area of cube=6l^2 Lateral Surface area of cube=4l^2 Volume of cube=l^3 File:Hexahedron.gif cube.]] == Relative 2-dimensional shape == The basic difference between a cube and a Square (geometry) is, a cube is a 3D figure (having 3 dimensions) i.e. length, breadth and height while a square has only 2 dimensions i.e. length and breadth. The 2-dimensional (2D) shape (like a circle, square, triangle, etc.) that a cube is made of is square (geometry). The sides (faces) of a cube are squares. The edges are straight lines. The corners (vertices) are at right angles. A cube has 8 corners, 12 edges and 6 faces, as in the most usual kind of dice. A tesseract carries this idea into the fourth dimension (4D) and is made of 8 cubes. == Volume == * The volume of a cube is the length of any one of the edges (they are all the same length so it does not matter which edge is used) ''cubed''. * This means you multiply the number by itself, and then by itself again. * If the edge is named 'd' (See Diagram), the equation would be this: Volume=d×d×d (or Volume=d3). == Cube-shaped figures == * Dice * Boxes Category:Platonic solids
