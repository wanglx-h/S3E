After the glaciers melted, Ireland became covered with trees, and some trees started becoming bogs -- specifically, raised bogs.https://www.teagasc.ie/crops/forestry/advice/general-topics/history-of-forestry-in-ireland/ The first people came to Ireland over 12,500 years ago, in the Palaeolithic period. They were semi-Nomad. If food ran out in the place they lived, they would move to another settlement. The first discovered settlement dates from at least 12,500 years ago. About 4000BC, in the New Stone Age within the Neolithic period, the first farmers arrived in Ireland. These people cleared openings in the forest and built permanent settlements with houses and farmland. The clearing of these trees started creating another type of bog, called blanket bogs. When people in this age died, they were buried in Tomb called Megalith. Many megaliths are still standing today, such as portal dolmens and passage tombs. The most famous megalith is Newgrange passage tomb in County Meath. === Bronze & Copper Ages === New settlers came around 2000BC, marking the start of the Bronze Age. Copper was Mining mainly in Mount Gabriel within County Cork, while tin was Import from Cornwall. The settlers used bronze to make weapons (like Sword) and early forms of jewellery (like sun discs and torcs). They Burial in court tombs or wedge tombs, and burial places have been found with stone circles. === Celts & the Iron Age === It is unknown when the Celts came to Ireland, but it is likely they brought the use of iron with them. The use of iron marks the start of the Iron Age. By about 300BC, the use of iron and Celtic culture was widespread in Ireland. The Celts lived in ring Fortification, hill forts, promontory forts and crannógs. Historians think that only the richer families and settlements lived in crannógs. These were man-made islands in the middle of lakes with houses on them. Celtic Ireland was split into around 150 kingdoms called tuath. The king was Election from the royal family. Below the king were the Nobles, and the Aos Dána, who were people with special skills, such as Poet, Druid (Priest), Judge and Artisan. === Christianity === By the early 6th century, Saint Patrick and other Missionary had Religious conversion most of Ireland to Christianity. Priest and Monk replaced Druids. Monastery soon were built, like Glendalough in County Wicklow. Glendalough and other monasteries built round towers to protect them when Vikings attacked. Small monasteries were also built in remote places, the most famous being Skellig Michael, off the coast of County Kerry. At this time, many hand-written Manuscript were created by monks in monasteries. Surviving manuscripts include the Cathach, the Book of Durrow, and the Book of Kells. Monks also produced fine silver Chalice, Crosier and Brooch, and Carving high Cross. === Anglo-Normans === In 1169, Anglo-Norman lords Invasion Ireland. They were led by Strongbow, who landed at Passage East in County Waterford. The Anglo-Normans conquered many parts of Ireland in the following 60 years. They introduced their way of life to the Irish people. Castles were built to defend the land, like Trim Castle in County Meath. During the Middle Ages, Ireland's first proper towns were built. The Feudalism was soon introduced in Ireland as a means of organising land. By the 1550s and the 1650s, four Plantation of Ulster had taken place in Ireland. === Partition === From 1801 until 1921, all of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1921 Northern Ireland was created and 'partitioned' from the south. Northern Ireland has stayed within the United Kingdom since then. In 1921 the south became the Irish Free State. In 1937 the Irish Free State adopted a new constitution, which named the state 'Republic of Ireland'. In 1948 the State passed the Republic of Ireland Act, declaring itself a republic. ==Migration== Many Irish people have Emigration to the United States, Canada, Australia, and South America. The Irish Potato Famine (which lasted from 1845 to 1849) killed up to a million Irish people by starvation and forced a million more to emigrate in order to survive. From a maximum of over 8 million in 1841, the total Irish population dropped to just over 4 million in the 1940s. Since then, it has increased to over 6 million. This population increase has been supported by the economic growth of the "Celtic Tiger" and (since 2004) immigration from countries in Eastern Europe like Poland. Today almost 80 million people around the world are descended from Irish people. ==Climate== Ireland has an oceanic climate.
