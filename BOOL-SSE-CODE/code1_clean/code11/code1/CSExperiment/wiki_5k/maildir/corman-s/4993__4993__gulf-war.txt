It started with the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq on 2 August, 1990. Iraq had occupied Kuwait as part of its territory. Iraq is said to have suffered around 80,000–100,000 soldier losses. There were two military operations. Operation Desert Shield brought Western troops to protect Dhahran, Saudi Arabia and the Arab Gulf states that Iraq had not attacked. Operation Desert Storm attacked Iraq's forces both in Kuwait and in southern Iraq. It started on 17 January 1991 with an air strike on Baghdad. Ground operations started 24 February. Iraqi forces set fire to oil wells to slow the attack. The war ended on 28 February 1991 with a ceasefire. The long Iran–Iraq War had ended in August 1988. Iraq owed a great amount of money to Saudi Arabia and had difficulty paying it back. Saddam Hussein declared the neighboring country of Kuwait to be siphoning Iraqi crude oil from across the border, and on 2 August, 1990 the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait started. On 17 January, 1991 the US began the Persian Gulf War with a massive US led air offensive known as Operation Desert Storm. The attacks were assisted by newly developed weapons, including stealth aircraft, cruise missiles and smart bombs. After 42 days of fighting U.S. President Bush declared a ceasefire on 28 February. By that time most Iraqi forces in Kuwait had either surrendered or fled. Operation Desert storm included a bombing campaign that targeted Iraqi aircraft, anti-aircraft systems, oil refineries, weapon factories, bridges, and roads. President George Bush decided not to depose Saddam Hussein.
