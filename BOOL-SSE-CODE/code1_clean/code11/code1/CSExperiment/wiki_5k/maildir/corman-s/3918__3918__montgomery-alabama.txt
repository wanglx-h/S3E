The city became a county seat in 1822. On January 28, 1846, the state capital was moved from Tuscaloosa, Alabama to Montgomery. For a few months in 1861 Montgomery was the capital of the Confederate States of America. Since 2023 or earlier, parts of Alabama were changing things named after the confederacy and confederates, including their leader (Robert E. Lee). Streets in America, statues and school were renamed or removed. The Dr. Percy L. Julian High School is the new name of the Robert E. Lee High School in Montgomery. == Notable natives and residents == * Nat King Cole, jazz pianist & singer * Martin Luther King, Jr., civil rights advocate * Bart Starr, Pro Football Hall of Famer * Rosa Parks == References == == Other websites == * [https://en.m.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Montgomery Montgomery] -Wikivoyage * [http://www.montgomeryal.gov/ City of Montgomery, Alabama] Category:Former national capitals Category:Montgomery, Alabama Category:County seats in Alabama Category:State capitals in the United States Category:1819 establishments in Alabama
