Most people there speak Spanish language. Chile, which claims a part of the Antarctica, is the longest country on earth. The Atacama Desert, in the north of the country, is the driest place on earth. The average rainfall there is less than per year. The center of Chile, with the two cities Santiago and Valparaíso, has a Mediterranean climate with an average temperature of in January and in July. In the middle of Chile, the country is very good for growing things. There are about 16.9 million people living in Chile in 2009. About 10 million people live in the center of Chile around Valparaíso and Santiago, on about 20% of the total land. Chile is a well-educated country. Only 2.7% are not able to read or write. Some believe that Chile has one of the best school systems in South America. About 95% of Chileans are people with a combination of European descent, mostly Spanish people, but also Germans, English people, Italians and Arab people. Around 2% of the population is Native American, but most people have native ancestors. Immigrants are 7% of the population. including Peruvians, Bolivians, Colombians, Haitians, Chinese and Europeans. The majority of people are Roman Catholic (62.8%), but many do not go to church. About 10% are Protestant, and there are some Judaism and Muslims as well. The country's official language is Spanish language. Chili peppers, first cultivated by Native Americans from other Latin American countries and the United States, did not come from this country, although it has a similar name. Chile's currency is the Chilean ''peso''. ==Geography== File:Parinacota volcano.jpg Chile borders Peru to the north, Bolivia to the northeast, Argentina to the east, and the Drake Passage in the far south. It is over north to south, but only at its widest point east to west. The northern Atacama Desert has great mineral wealth, mostly copper and nitrates. Chile is the largest producer of copper. The Andes Mountains are on the eastern border. Chile controls Easter Island and Sala y Gómez Island, the easternmost islands of Polynesia. ==Animals and plants== File:BeagleChannelGlacier.jpg File:Sephanoides fernandensis.jpg ===Animals=== Only a few of the many distinctive South American animals are found in Chile. Among the larger mammals are the Cougar or cougar, the llama-like guanaco and the fox-like chilla. In the forest region, several types of marsupials and a small deer known as the pudu are found. There are many species of small birds, but not most of the larger common Latin American types. Few freshwater fish are from Chile, but North American trout have been successfully introduced into the Andean lakes. The coast of Chile is close to the Humboldt Current, so ocean waters have many fish and other forms of marine life. This in turn supports a rich variety of waterfowl, including several penguins. There are many whales, and six species of seals in the area. ===Fungi=== Just over 3,000 species of fungi are recorded in Chile.Oehrens, E.B. "Flora Fungosa Chilena". Universidad de Chile, Santiago de Chile, 1980 This number is far from complete. The true total number of fungal species in Chile is likely to be far higher. The generally accepted estimate is that only about 7 percent of all fungi worldwide have so far been discovered.Kirk, P.M., Cannon, P.F., Minter, D.W. and Stalpers, J. "Dictionary of the Fungi". Edn 10. CABI, 2008 ===Plants=== The northernmost coastal and central region is largely empty of vegetation. It is the most close to an absolute desert in the world. On the slopes of the Andes, besides the scattered tola desert brush, grasses are found. The central valley has several species of cactus, the hardy espinos (a kind of acacia tree), the Chilean pine, the southern beeches and the copihue, a red bell-shaped flower that is Chile's national flower. In southern Chile, south of the Biobío River lots of rain has made dense forests of laurels, magnolias, and various species of conifers and beeches, which become smaller and more stunted to the south. The cold temperatures and winds of the extreme south make it impossible for heavy forestation. Grassland is found in Atlantic Chile (in Patagonia). Much of the Chilean plant life is different from that of neighboring Argentina. This shows that the Andean barrier existed during the formation of Chile. ==Regions== Chile is divided into 16 regions. The regions are then divided into provinces. Each province is divided into Communes of Chile. {|class="wikitable sortable" |-bgcolor=#ececec ! class="unsortable" |Flag !Name(English language/Spanish language) !Capital (political) !Area (km2) !Population(2017 census) |- |Image:Flag of Arica y Parinacota, Chile.svg |Arica y Parinacota RegionRegión de Arica y Parinacota |Arica, Chile || align=right|16,873.3 || align=right| 226,068 |- |Image:Flag of Tarapaca, Chile.svg |Tarapacá RegionRegión de Tarapacá |Iquique || align=right|42,225.8 || align=right| 330,558 |- |Image:Flag of Antofagasta Region, Chile.svg |Antofagasta RegionRegión de Antofagasta |Antofagasta || align=right|126,049.1 || align=right| 607,534 |- |Image:Flag of Atacama, Chile.svg |Atacama RegionRegión de Atacama |Copiapó || align=right|75,176.2 || align=right| 286,168 |- |Image:Flag of Coquimbo Region, Chile.svg |Coquimbo RegionRegión de Coquimbo |La Serena, Chile || align=right|40,579.9 || align=right| 757,586 |- |Image:Flag of Valparaiso Region, Chile.svg |Valparaíso RegionRegión de Valparaíso |Valparaíso || align=right|16,396.1 || align=right| 1,815,902 |- |Image:Flag of the Metropolitan Region, Chile.svg |Santiago Metropolitan RegionRegión Metropolitana de Santiago |Santiago || align=right|15,403.2 || align=right| 7,112,808 |- |Image:Flag of O'Higgins Region, Chile.svg |O'Higgins RegionRegión del Libertador General Bernardo O'Higgins |Rancagua || align=right|16,387.0 || align=right| 914,555 |- |Image:Flag of Maule, Chile.svg |Maule RegionRegión del Maule |Talca || align=right|30,296.1 || align=right| 1,044,950 |- ||Image:Flag of Ñuble Region, Chile.svg |Ñuble RegionRegión de Ñuble |Chillán || align=right|13,178.5 || align=right| 480,609 |- ||Image:Flag of Biobío Region, Chile.svg |Biobío RegionRegión del Biobío |Concepción, Chile || align=right|23,890.2 || align=right| 1,556,805 |- |Image:Flag of La Araucanía Region.svg |Araucanía RegionRegión de La Araucanía |Temuco || align=right|31,842.3 || align=right| 957,224 |- |Image:Flag of Los Ríos, Chile.svg |Los Ríos RegionRegión de Los Ríos |Valdivia, Chile || align=right|18,429.5 || align=right| 384,837 |- |Image:Flag of Los Lagos Region, Chile.svg |Los Lagos RegionRegión de Los Lagos |Puerto Montt || align=right|48,583.6 || align=right| 828,708 |- |Image:Flag of Aysen, Chile.svg |Aysén RegionRegión Aysén del General Carlos Ibáñez del Campo |Coihaique || align=right|108,494.4 || align=right| 103,158 |- |Image:Flag of Magallanes y la Antártica Chilena, Chile.svg |Magallanes RegionRegión de Magallanes y de la Antártica Chilena |Punta Arenas || align=right|132,291.1 || align=right| 166,533 |} ==Literature== Chileans call their country ''país de poetas''-country of poets.

Isabel Allende is the best-selling Chilean novelist, with 51 millions of her novels sold worldwide. Novelist José Donoso's novel ''The Obscene Bird of the Night'' is said by critic Harold Bloom to be one of the important works of 20th century Western literature. Another internationally recognized Chilean novelist is Roberto Bolaño. His translations into English have had an excellent reception from the critics. == People == The Chilean population is estimated to be about 65% mestizo, 35% white, 5% native. ==Food and drink== File:Chilean Cazuela.JPG Chilean food shows the differences in the land across the country. There is an assortment of seafood, beef, fruits, and vegetables. Traditional recipes include asado, cazuela, Empanada, Humita, pastel de choclo, pastel de papas, curanto and sopaipillas. Crudos is an example of food from the various ethnic groups in Chile. Onions were brought by the Spain, and the use of mayonnaise and yogurt was introduced by Germans immigrants, as was beer. ==Sports== File:Estadio Nacional de Chile 2.jpg Chile's most popular sport is association football.

She was the first woman from Latin America to win a grand slam tournament. Luis Ayala was twice a runner-up at the French Open and both Ríos, Nicolas Massu Friedt and Fernando González Ciuffardi reached the Australian Open men's singles finals. González also won a silver medal in singles at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. At the Summer Olympic Games Chile has a total of two gold medals (tennis), seven silver medals (athletics, equestrian, boxing, shooting and tennis) and four bronze medals (tennis, boxing and football). In 2012 Chile won its first Paralympic Games medal (gold in Athletics). Rodeo is the country's national sport. It is practiced in the more rural areas of the country. A sport similar to hockey. Skiing and snowboarding are practiced at ski centers in the Central Andes. Surfing is popular at some coastal towns. Polo is professionally practiced in Chile. In 2008 Chile won top prize in the World Polo Championship. Basketball is a popular sport. Chile earned a bronze medal in the first men's FIBA World Championship held in 1950. They won a second bronze medal when Chile hosted the 1959 FIBA World Championship. Chile hosted the first FIBA World Championship for Women in 1953 finishing the tournament with the silver medal. Other sports such as marathons and ultramarathons are also increasing in popularity. San Pedro de Atacama is host to the yearly "Atacama Crossing," a six-stage, 250-kilometer footrace which has about 150 competitors from 35 countries each year. The Dakar Rally off-road automobile race has been held in both Chile and Argentina since 2009. == Immigration to Chile == A few European immigrants settled in Chile during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, mainly from Spain.

The coat of arms shows the two national animals: the condor (''Vultur gryphus'', a very large bird that lives in the mountains) and the huemul (''Hippocamelus bisulcus,'' an endangered white tail deer). It also has the saying ''Por la razón o la fuerza'' (''By reason or by force''). The flag of Chile has two equal horizontal bands of white (top) and red. There is a blue square the same height as the white band. The square has a white five-pointed star in the center. The star is a guide to progress and honor. Blue is for the sky, white is for the snow-covered Andes, and red stands for the blood spilled to get independence. == Gallery == File:Mapa administrativo de Chile.png|Administrative Map File:Benjamín Vicuña 02.jpg|Actor Benjamín Vicuña File:Nicolas Massu.jpg|Tennis player Nicolas Massu File:María Elena Swett (Descarado, 2006).jpg|Actress María Elena Swett File:Manuel Pellegrini(2).jpg|Manuel Pellegrini File:Puerto Varas, Chile (10986508514).jpg|Puerto Varas File:Santiago en invierno.jpg|Metropolitan Region File:Renaca4.jpg|Reñaca to central Chile File:Edificios stgo.jpg|Santiago of Chile File:Valdivia.jpg|Valdivia in southern Chile File:Puerto Octay.jpg|Puerto Octay File:Lolol calle Acacias (28174146348).jpg|Lolol ==Related pages== * Chile at the Olympics * Chile national football team * List of rivers of Chile ==References== Category:Chile Category:Spanish-speaking countries
