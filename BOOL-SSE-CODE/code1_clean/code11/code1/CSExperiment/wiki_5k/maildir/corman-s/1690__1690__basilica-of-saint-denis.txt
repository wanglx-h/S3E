It is famous for its architecture and as the burial place for many King of France. It is in the suburb of Saint Denis, which is in the north of Paris. Since 1966, it is the cathedral of the diocese of Saint-Denis. It is located in the Greater Paris area, about from Paris. The Basilica is named after Saint Denis. Saint Denis is the patron saint of France. He was also the first Bishop of Paris. The Basilica was an Early Gothic building. In 1136 the Abbot Suger (1081 - 1155) began replacing the building, bit by bit, beginning with the west front and then with a new east end. The east end is said to be the first building in the Gothic architecture style. It was not completed until the 13th century. The current pipe of the basilica is the first organ built by Aristide Cavaille-Coll. With 4200 pipes, it contains a lot of innovations, opening the romantic area. The French organist Pierre Pincemaille, titular between 1987 and 2018, set up lots of recitals and recorded 8 CDs with this instrument. == People who are buried in Saint Denis Basilica == == Other websites == * [http://www.linternaute.com/sortir/patrimoine/ile-de-france/seine-saint-denis/edifices-religieux/basilique-saint-denis/1.shtml L'Internaute Magazine: Diaporama] Category:Cathedrals in France Category:Saint-Denis Category:13th-century buildings and structures
