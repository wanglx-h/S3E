A '''soap opera''' is a television or radio program that broadcast in episode series. This means that each episode continues telling a story, which, in turn, tells more of the last episode's story. A single story on a soap opera can be told for weeks, months, or sometimes even years. In United States, each soap opera airs every day, Monday through Friday, in the afternoon. Because they air at this time, they are sometimes called '''daytime serials'''. In the United Kingdom and other countries, the soap operas air in the evening, twice or three times a week. This is a list of soap operas that air in America, in their current order of popularity: #''The Young and the Restless'' #''The Bold and the Beautiful'' #''General Hospital'' #''Supernatural (TV series)'' #''Lost (TV series)'' #''Days of Our Lives'' #''All My Children'' #''As the World Turns'' #''One Life to Live'' #''Guiding Light'' #''Passions'' There are still two soap operas that air in Australia, Network Ten's ''Neighbours'' and the Seven Network's ''Home and Away''. Strangely, ''Neighbours'' is more popular in England than it is in Australia. In the U.K., the most popular soap operas are ''Coronation Street'' and EastEnders, which have been running since 1960 and 1985 respectively. ''Coronation Street'' is about people who live in Manchester, in the northern part of England. ''EastEnders'' is about people who live in an imaginary place called Walford in East London with most of the action taking place in Albert Square. Another popular soap opera is ''Emmerdale'' which began in 1972, and it is about people who live in a small village in Yorkshire, also in the northern part of England. In the 1970s, ''Crossroads (British TV series)'' became the most watched soap in England. It was shown from 1964 to 1988 and again from 2001 to 2003. In Latin America (including Brazil), Spain, Portugal and Portuguese language-speaking countries in Africa (like Angola), soap operas are called ''telenovelas'', and usually run for a limited time. ==Related pages== *Dorama *Serial (radio and television) *Radio drama *Playwright *Theatre == References == Category:Soap operas Category:Television genres
