Image:Earth-lighting-equinox EN.png File:World map with equator.svg The '''equator''' is a line which is not real drawn around a sphere or planet, such as the Earth. It is one of the lines known as a line of latitude, or circle of latitude. The name "equator" is Latin for "even-maker"; at equator the day and night are exactly the same length around the year. The equator is halfway between the North Pole and the South Pole. There, the surface of the planet is parallel (geometry) to the Axis (mathematics) of rotation. The equator divides the surface into the northern hemisphere and the southern hemisphere. == Climate == Unlike the northern hemisphere and the southern hemisphere, countries around the equator do not experience the four seasons, and the climate is usually very humid. ==Related pages== * Northern hemisphere * Southern hemisphere * Solstice and equinox * Tropic of Cancer * Tropic of Capricorn * Arctic Circle * Antarctic Circle * Celestial equator Category:Lines of latitude
