It was widely used in the western part of the Mediterranean. The Romance languages developed from its spoken informal version, called Vulgar Latin. Latin was important to Christianity for many centuries. It is still spoken today during some religious activities. It is an official language in the Vatican, where the Pope leads the Roman Catholicism Church (building). People in the Vatican sometimes speak to one another in Latin if they have different mother tongues. The mass (liturgy) of the Catholic Church is often done entirely in Latin. It is called is the Mass of the Roman Rite (Extraordinary Form). Latin was once the most important language in most of Europe during the Middle Ages. It was taught in many European schools, and all university used it as their teaching language. Latin began to lose its importance in the Reformation, but it was still often used by writers of scientific books and encyclopedias. Until around 1900, many universities accepted Thesis written in Latin. ==Today== File:WIKITONGUES- Titus speaking Latin.webmDue to not being spoken as a first language in modern times, Latin is termed a 'dead language'. ===Classics=== People still read Latin classics such as the poems of Virgil, the memoirs of Julius Caesar and the speeches of Cicero. ===Science=== Also, Latin is widely used as an international auxiliary language, notably in the Catholic Church and by biologists when they describe and name new species. ===Medicine=== Some terms used in medicine to name parts of the body (such as bones), and names of some diseases, are also written in Latin. ==Varieties== There are three types of Latin: Classical Latin, Vulgar Latin and Ecclesiastical Latin. Classical Latin was used by the educated Romans and is still studied around the world. Vulgar Latin was the more common spoken variety used by the common Romans and was learned by the peoples conquered by them. Ecclesiastical Latin is common in Italian schools and still used by the Roman Catholic Church. ===Romance languages=== As people from other regions of Europe learned Vulgar Latin during Roman conquests, each region developed its own language, which was a simplified form of Latin. Those languages are called Romance languages and are still spoken today. ====Types==== The five Romance languages with the largest number of speakers are Spanish language, French language, Portuguese language, Italian language and Romanian language. The Romance languages are very similar to one another, and speakers of one Romance language can understand many words and sentences in both texts and spoken conversations from another Romance language. For example, speakers of Portuguese can often understand Spanish. It can be said that the Romance languages are modern dialects of Latin. ==Grammar== File:Latin plaque 7 Jul 1883.jpg Latin has a similar inflection structure to Ancient Greek but a different alphabet. Latin has seven different Case (grammar): Nominative case, Vocative case, Accusative case, Genitive case, Dative case, Ablative case and Locative case. The vocative case is almost always the same as the nominative case. The locative usually takes the form of the dative. Only place names and some nouns have the locative case. Latin nouns are declined, or changed, according to how they are used in the sentence. A noun can be declined five different ways. These ways are called declensions. The declensions are numbered 1 to 5 (first declension, second declension etc.), each having different endings that identify the noun's declension. When a noun is declined, twelve forms are made, two for each of the noun cases (the locative is omitted). A similar thing is done to verbs, called conjugation. When a verb is conjugated, six forms are made. There are five factors that can change a verb: person, number, tense, voice and mood. In all, there are 120 possible forms Latin verbs. ==Writing== File:Lapis-niger.jpg is a stele from the 6th or 5th century BC. It bears one of the oldest known Latin inscriptions.]] Latin used to be written on plates of wax. There was little space and so words were run together, with no space between words. Sometimes papyrus was used, but that was expensive. Punctuation was an ancient idea but came to Latin later.The Mesha Stele or Moabite Stone is a stele set up around 840BC by King Mesha of Moab (a kingdom in modern Jordan). The stele uses Full stop. Lowercase letters (small letters) are relatively-modern inventions. The Roman alphabet was derived from Etruscan language .

There was no fear or punishment: there were no threatening words to be read, fixed in bronze, no crowd of suppliants fearing the judge’s face they lived safely without protection. No pine tree felled in the mountains had yet reached the flowing waves to travel to other lands: human beings only knew their own shores. There were no steep ditches surrounding towns, no straight war-trumpets, no coiled horns, no swords and helmets. Without the use of armies, people passed their lives in gentle peace and security. |} ==Post-Roman age== File:Linnaeus1758-title-page.jpg, published in 1798.

Academia such as Thomas Aquinas, Petrarch, Erasmus, Martin Luther, Nicolaus Copernicus, René Descartes and Isaac Newton wrote in Latin. For example, Hugo Grotius published his ''De jure belli ac pacis'' (On the Law of War and Peace) in Latin as late as 1625, which is one of the bases of international law. ==Related pages== * Ancient Greek * Syriac language * Byzantine Empire * Hebrew language ** Yiddish ** Ladino language ** Judeo-Arabic dialects ** Judeo-Aramaic languages * Aramaic language * Phoenician alphabet ** Latin alphabet ** Greek alphabet ** Cyrillic alphabet ** Hebrew alphabet ** Aramaic alphabet * Germanic languages ** Gothic language ** English language ** German language ==References== ==Other websites== * * [http://learningtechnologies.truman.edu/r_harrison/home.htm Post-Classical Latin (including Medieval and Neo-Latin)] * [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/latin/beginners/default.htm Beginners' Latin] on http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ * [http://wredmond.home.texas.net/index.html Glossarium Anglico-Latinum] having many modern words * [http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/Latin_language Latin language] Citizendium Category:Latin language
