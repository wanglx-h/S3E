Retrieved October 11, 2017 Astaire's career was 76 years long. He starred in over 10 Broadway theatre and West End theatre musicals. He made 31 musical movies. He was also a dancer. He had very good rhythm and creativity. ==Life== Astaire started dancing on the stage with his sister Adèle, as a child, in 1905. Their Broadway career lasted from 1917 to 1932. They became world-famous after World War I, and regularly performed on both sides of the Atlantic. When she married he started a movie partnership with Ginger Rogers. After that, he danced with a succession of talented American dancers on movie and on television. He appeared in 32 movies. His movie partners included Eleanor Powell, Ann Miller, Vera-Ellen, Cyd Charisse: all high-class dancers, and on TV with Barrie Chase. Their ''An evening with Fred Astaire'' won nine Emmy Award in 1958. Many male dancers of the 20th century were influenced by him, and said so. He owed a lot to the choreography of Hermes Pan, but even more to his own perfectionism and relentless practice. Astaire was also an excellent actor, and a successful, though personally modest, singer. He introduced some of the most celebrated songs from the ''Great American Songbook''. He married Phyllis Potter in 1933; they had two children. After her death, he remarried in 1980 to Robyn Smith, a female jockey 45 years his junior. ==References== ===Sources=== * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *''The Astaire Family Papers'', The Howard Gotleib Archival Research Center, Boston University, MA ==Other websites== * * * * * *[https://web.archive.org/web/20070108144230/http://www.alsodances.net/biography/Fred Astaire biography at AlsoDances.Net] * * *[https://web.archive.org/web/20051107021938/http://www.adherents.com/people/pa/Fred_Astaire.html Astaire's religious views incl. many extracts from his biographers] *[https://web.archive.org/web/20160115081527/http://www.indianauteur.com/blog/?p=228#more-228 Astaire or Kelly: A Generation Apart at Indian Auteur] *[http://news.bbc.co.uk/media/video/39522000/rm/_39522952_astaire08_astaire_vi.ram Ava Astaire discusses her father's legacy] (BBC Television—RealPlayer required) *[http://www.kaneprod.com/astaire/astaire.htm Radio Interview—Fred Astaire—1968] *[https://web.archive.org/web/20150613123029/http://www.faconference.org/pdf/AstaireReview.pdf "Fred Astaire and the art of fun"]: an essay on the Oxford Fred Astaire conference from [http://www.the-tls.co.uk TLS], July 16, 2008. *[http://www.virtual-history.com/movie/person/61/fred-astaire Photographs and literature] at Virtual History }} Category:1899 births Category:1987 deaths Category:Academy Award Honorary Award winners Category:Actors from Omaha, Nebraska Category:American dancers Category:American movie actors Category:American stage actors Category:American television actors Category:BAFTA Award winning actors Category:Deaths from pneumonia Category:Emmy Award winning actors Category:Golden Globe Award winning actors Category:Infectious disease deaths in Los Angeles Category:Kennedy Center honorees Category:Singers from Nebraska
