It was made as such in 1873. In that year, three towns on the Danube, namely ''Buda'', ''Óbuda (Old Buda)'' and ''Pest'' were united. About 1.7 million people live in the city. Its highest place is ''János Hill (527 m).'' == Climate == Budapest has a Humidity subtropical climate with relatively cold winters and quite warm summers. == History == Celtic tribes lived there before 1 AD. Later, the Roman Empire transformed the first settlements into the Roman town of Aquincum. The Hungarians arrived in the territory of modern Hungary only at the end of 9th century AD. Budapest also became the co-capital of the Austria-Hungary,Alexander Watson, ''Ring of Steel: Germany and Austria-Hungary at War, 1914–1918'' (2014). pp 536–40.: In the capital cities of Vienna and Budapest, the leftist and liberal movements and opposition parties strengthened and supported the separatism of ethnic minorities. a great power that dissolved in 1918 after World War I. The city was the focal point of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, the Battle of Budapest in 1945, and the 1956 Hungarian Revolution.UN General Assembly ''Special Committee on the Problem of Hungary'' (1957) == Landmarks == Budapest has historical buildings, baths and parks. The Roman Catholic cathedral, '''St. Stephen's Basilica''', is in the 5th district of Budapest. The Church (building) is a Neo-Renaissance-style cathedral. It is one of the most significant church buildings in Hungary. The building is named in honor of the Hungarian founding king, St. Stephen (975-1038), whose right hand, the Holy Right, is kept here as a relic. With a height of 96 Metre, it is the fourth-tallest building in the country and the third tallest in the capital after the Hungarian Parliament Building and the MOL Campus. The former royal palace, the '''Buda Castle''' -as part of the Castle District- has been part of Budapest's World Heritage Sites since 1987. The Gothic architecture-style royal palace was built in the 1300s and lasted until the end of the 1400s. Due to the Turkish occupation of Hungary from 1541 to 1686, very serious damage was done to both the castle and the buildings of the Castle District. In the building of the palace, the National Széchényi Library has been located in the back, decorated with Art Nouveau elements, and the Hungarian National Gallery and the Budapest History Museum are located in the palace. Also on the Castle Hill, the '''Matthias Church''' is a Gothic architecture Church (building) with a great historical past. It was originally built in Romanesque architecture style in 1015, but was destroyed during the Mongol invasions of Europe in 1241. The current building was built in the 14th century and underwent a thorough reconstruction in the late 19th century. After the occupation of Buda, the Church (building) was transformed into a mosque, during which the late Gothic frescoes inside the church were destroyed. After the liberation of Buda, according to the plans of Frigyes Schulek, it was restored to its second, Gothic state. During the World War II, it was used as a camp by the Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union during The siege of Budapest (1956). The '''Hungarian Parliament Building''', also known as the Parliament of Budapest after its location, is the seat of the National Assembly (Hungary), a notable Landmarks of Hungary, and a popular tourist destination in Budapest. It is situated on the Kossuth Lajos Square in the Pest (city) side of the city, on the eastern bank of the Danube. It was designed by Hungary architect Imre Steindl in neo-Gothic style and opened in 1902. It has been the largest building in Hungary since its completion, and the third biggest Parliament building in the world. Further north, the building of the '''National Police Headquarters''' (in the common language “Police-Palace”) located in the Árpád Göncz City Center. Since its completion, its shape and size have been one of the defining buildings of the whole of Budapest in terms of cityscape. The plans were completed in the 1990s by József Finta and Géza Meichl, and their construction was financed by Postabank collaborating with the Hungary police. 36,000 Cubic metre of concrete and 4.5 thousand Metric ton of rebar were used for the construction. The headquarters can be divided into two parts, one eight-story and columnar and the other sixteen stories and cylindrical, with police antennas at the top that extend 93 Metre high. In 2007, an unknown person fired at the building with a machine gun. On the south, in the 10th district of Budapest, located the '''transmission tower on Száva Street'''. With a height of 154 Metre, it is the third-tallest structure in Budapest (after the Mount Széchenyi TV mast and the chimney of Óbuda Power Plant). The tower is well visible from the southern Pest region of the capital, but it can be seen in several lookouts of Buda too. It was built in 1987, and it is currently owned by Magyar Telekom. As a backbone transmitter, it broadcasts digital terrestrial radio (T-DAB +) and digital television channels (DVB-T standard, MinDig TV and mobile phone DVB-H). Other landmarks in Budapest are the Citadel (Budapest), the Statue of Liberty (Budapest), the Millenium Monument, the Zoo (Budapest), the Hungarian National Museum, the Great Market Hall, the Dohány Street Synagogue and the famous thermal baths (Széchenyi thermal bath, Szent Gellért thermal bath, Király thermal bath). Budapest is also known for the ruins of Aquincum, the capital city of the Pannonia. == Trivia == It has the oldest Rapid transit-line in mainland Europe.[http://visitbudapest.travel/articles/10-facts-you-may-not-know-about-budapest/ 10 Facts You May Not Know About Budapest] Twin cities of Budapest: * Beijing China * Berlin Germany * Bethlehem * Florence Italy * Fort Worth, Texas United States * Frankfurt Germany * Kraków Poland * Lisbon, Portugal * New York City United States * Sarajevo Bosnia and Herzegovina * Shanghai China * Skopje North Macedonia * Subotica Serbia * Târgu Mureș Romania * Tehran Iran * Tel Aviv Israel * Vienna Austria * Zagreb Croatia == References == == Other sources == * Evans, R.J.W.
