A '''mule''' is a Animall hybrid of a female horse (a mare) and a male donkey (a jack). The horse and the donkey are different species, with different numbers of Chromosome; of the two possible first-generation hybrids between them, the mule is easier to obtain and more common than the Hinny (hybrid), which is the offspring of a female donkey (a jenny) and a male horse (a stallion). A mule is generally sterile. Although it is extremely unlikely for a mule to become pregnant (less than 300 reported cases worldwide), it is possible. Mules vary widely in size, from small miniature mules under to large and powerful mules standing up to at the shoulders. The average weight range is between about . A mule is generally larger than a donkey and smaller than a horse. A mule has the long ears, thin limbs, small :wikt:hoove and the short hair of the donkey, while its height, the shape of the neck and body, and its teeth are more similar to those of the horse. The color of its coat can be any color seen in the horse or in the donkey, which can be white, grey, brown or black. They are used mostly for pulling carts and transportation.
