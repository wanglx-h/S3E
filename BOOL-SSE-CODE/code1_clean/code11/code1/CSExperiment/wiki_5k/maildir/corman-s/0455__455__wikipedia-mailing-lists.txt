Subject: Wikipedia:Mailing lists
Wikipedia has lots of ''mailing lists''. You can read them on the internet or by email or by NNTP using GMANE. Mailing lists show up in Google searches. Old messages can be found at GMANE [http://www.gmane.org/] and MARC [http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/]. There is not a mailing list only for Simple English. You should probably use the English list or the international list. == Project-specific == Administrators' mailing list, mainly used as a route of appeal for unblocks. All current administrators may subscribe to this list. *mail:simple-admins-l The WP:Oversight team also have a mailing list for suppression requests. Only current oversighters may subscribe to this list. *mail:oversight-wp-simple == General, project-wide mailing list == The general project-wide list is '''mail:wikipedia-l'''. It's a resource for Wikipedia authors. If you don't want to use Wikipedia (or m:) for questions, or if you'd like to talk to other Wikipedia:Wikipedians outside the wiki format, then you can sign up for Wikipedia-L. * mail:wikipedia-l * mailarchive:wikipedia-l * [news://news.gmane.org/gmane.science.linguistics.wikipedia.misc Wikipedia-L via NNTP] == English Wikipedia mailing list == Since Wikipedia-L developed into an extremely high traffic list, a separate mailing list for the English Wikipedia was created. For discussion of issues concerning the English wikipedia only, please sign up for '''WikiEN-L''' and keep Wikipedia-L for general policy discussions! * mail:wikien-l * mailarchive:wikien-l * [news://news.gmane.org/gmane.science.linguistics.wikipedia.english WikiEN-L via NNTP] == Foundation mailing list == Foundation-l is for any cross-project issues, discussions and cooperation. It is also for things that affect the Wikimedia foundation. Legal issues can be posted to this list. * mail:foundation-l * mailarchive:foundation-l * [news://news.gmane.org/gmane.science.linguistics.wikipedia.foundation Foundation-L via NNTP] == Language-specific mailing lists == There are also language-specific mailing lists for Wikipedia in mail:wikida-l, mail:wikinl-l, mail:wikieo-l, mail:wikies-l, mail:wikifr-l, mail:wikide-l, mail:wikija-l, mail:wikipl-l, mail:wikipt and mail:wikisv-l. == Technical issues mailing list == And, there's a mailing list for technical discussions regarding development of the Wikipedia software: '''Wikitech-L'''. * mail:wikitech-l * mailarchive:wikitech-l * [news://news.gmane.org/gmane.science.linguistics.wikipedia.technical Wikitech-L via NNTP] == Wikibooks mailing list == Mailing list for the wikibooks: project. * mail:textbook-l * mailarchive:textbook-l * [news://news.gmane.org/gmane.org.wikimedia.textbook Textbook-L via NNTP] Wikipedia also has a real-time chat channel.
