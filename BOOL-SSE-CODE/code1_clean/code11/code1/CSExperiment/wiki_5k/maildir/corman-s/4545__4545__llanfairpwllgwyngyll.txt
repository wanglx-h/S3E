In a 2018 study, it had a population of 2,999 residents. It is situated just across the Menai Strait from the city of Bangor, Gwynedd. It is famous for having for the longest place name in Europe and the second-longest official one-word place name in the world, right after the hill '''Taumata­whakatangihanga­koauau­o­tamatea­turi­pukaka­piki­maunga­horo­nuku­pokai­whenua­ki­tana­tahu''' located in '''Pōrangahau''', New Zealand. The village's official name contains 58 characters and 19 syllables. It translates into English language as ''St Mary's Church in the Hollow of the White Hazel near a Rapid Whirlpool and the Church of St. Tysilio near the Red Cave''. The village was given this long name as a publicity stunt to bring people to the village in the Victorian era of railway tourism. The stunt was successful. A 2011 survey revealed that 71% of the village's population can speak Welsh language. The village has a Llanfairpwll railway station, known as ''Llanfairpwll railway station''. The station is known for its huge sign of the village's name and how to pronounce it. The station provides direct trains to Holyhead to the west and Manchester, Crewe, Chester, Shrewsbury, Birmingham, and South Wales to the east.The station is also what is called a request stop making it not have any trains scheduled to stop. ==Gallery== File:UK_longest_railway_sign.jpg|Station sign File:Llanfair_Pwllgwyngyll_roofscape_(1)_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1058331.jpg|View over Llanfairpwllgwyngyll File:Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch.JPG|James Pringle Weavers Shop with a translation of the village's name File:Llanfair_Church.jpg|St Mary's Church Category:Villages in Wales
