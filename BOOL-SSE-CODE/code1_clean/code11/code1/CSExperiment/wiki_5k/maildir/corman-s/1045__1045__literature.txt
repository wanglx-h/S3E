Most are written, but some are shared by word of mouth. Literature usually means a work of poetry, theatre or narrative. There are many different kinds of literature, such as poetry, Drama, or novels. They can also be put into groups by their language, history time, place of origin, literary genre, and subject. The word "literature" comes from the Latin language word "literatura," which means "writing formed with letters." Most of the earliest works were epic poems. Epic poems are long stories or myths about adventures, such as the Epic of Gilgamesh from ancient Mesopotamia. ''Ramayana'' and ''Mahabharata'', two India epics, are still read today. The Iliad and ''Odyssey'' are two famous Greek language poems by Homer. They were shared over time through speaking and memory and were written down around the 9th or 8th century BCE.

Literature is also related to people and community. According to Sangidu (2004) as quoted by Arfani et.al (2023), "literature is a part of society, a fact that inspires authors to involve themselves in the life order of the community where they are and try to fight for the position of the social structure and the problems face in society". ==Related pages== *English literature *French literature *Italian literature *German literature *Japanese literature *American literature *Spanish literature *Modernist literature == References == Category:Literature
