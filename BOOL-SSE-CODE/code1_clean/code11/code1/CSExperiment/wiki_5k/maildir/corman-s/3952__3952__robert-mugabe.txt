He was the President of Zimbabwe from 1987 to 2017. Before that, he was Prime Minister, the head of government, after being elected in 1980. For many years before he resigned, Mugabe ruled his country in the style of a dictator. ==Presidency== His first years as leader were prosperous. He introduced land reforms, which were supposed to give the land owned by white people back to the "original" black people owners. This has had a serious impact on how the country is seen from outside. In recent years, Mugabe has allowed violence against the white citizens of the country as well as to opposition leaders of all races. The reforms were done in 1998. In 2001, the United Nations imposed sanctions against Zimbabwe. This was done because human rights abuses came to the attention of the United Nations. Mugabe was known to be close with former Prime Minister of Malaysia Mahathir Mohamad. On November 15, 2017, he was placed under house arrest as Zimbabwe's military took control in a 2017 Zimbabwean coup d'état. On November 21, 2017, Mugabe resigned as President of Zimbabwe. It ended his rule of 40 years. ==Death== Mugabe was hospitalized in April 2019, making the last of several trips to Singapore for medical treatment. He died on 6 September 2019 at a Singapore hospital, at the age of 95. The cause of death was prostate cancer. ==References== ==Other websites== Category:1924 births Category:2019 deaths Category:Deaths from prostate cancer Category:Former dictators Category:Former members of the Order of the Bath Category:Presidents of Zimbabwe Category:Prime ministers of Zimbabwe Category:Roman Catholics Category:African Union chairpersons
