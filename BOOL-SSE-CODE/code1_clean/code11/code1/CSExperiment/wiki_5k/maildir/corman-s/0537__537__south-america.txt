Brazil's soil is very good for growing coffee. A great number of minerals have been found. Few, however, have been mined. Among those that were mined are iron, manganese, gold, and gemstones. The tropical forests are rich in valuable trees, like mahogany, Ebony (tree), and rubber. Oil is also a resource in some places. == Wildlife == South America is home to a large variety of animal life. These include animals such as jaguars, macaws, monkeys, anacondas, llamas, piranhas, toucans, Rhea (bird)s, tapirs, cougars, condors and chinchillas. == Tourist attractions == The most popular attractions are: * Machu Picchu, a historic site in Peru which is a city made of stone and has an over 26 mile marathon. * The Iguaçu Falls, a waterfall on the border between Argentina and Brazil * The Angel Falls, the world's tallest waterfall, in Venezuela * Rio de Janeiro in Brazil is a huge city, famous for its carnival, beaches (Copacabana and Ipanema), and 38m Christ the Redeemer (statue). * The Patagonia region in Argentina and Chile == The Amazon rain forest == The amazon rain forest is a moist grassy land where many wild animals live and contains the amazon river which is the 2nd longest river in the world and has the largest volume of water. The world's longest river is the Nile in Africa. The forest is known as a rain forest as it rains very often but due to the dense surroundings not every droplet reaches the bottom. The Amazon is shared by eight '''countries''' (Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana and Suriname) and stretches for 6.7 million kilometers2. In the amazon rain forest, hundreds of thousands of trees have been cut down for wood and paper, meaning that the forest is endangered. Unlike the Boreial forest in Canada the trees are not getting replanted. == Related pages == * Latin America * Americas * Latin American Literature == References == Category:South America Category:Gondwana
