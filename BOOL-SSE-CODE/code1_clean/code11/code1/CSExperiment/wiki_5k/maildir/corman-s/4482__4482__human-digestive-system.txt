File:Digestive system diagram en.svg The '''digestive system''' is the parts of the body that Digestion food. It is the '''gastrointestinal system'''. It breaks down food into simple chemicals which can be wikt:absorb into the blood stream. It also produces waste, which be expelled by passing gas, pooping, or even passing urine. From the blood stream, nutrients go to the liver, which is a kind of chemical factory for the body. The liver adjusts the nutrients so that the mix is what the body needs. In the stomach, gastric acid is introduced. This is basically dilute hydrochloric acid. It is very reactive and has a pH of 1.5 to 3.5.Elaine N. Marieb, Katja Hoehn, Katja N. Hoehn 2018. ''Human anatomy and physiology'', 11th edition. Pearson Education, p1264. ISBN 978-0134580999 The stomach has a layer of mucus to protect itself from the acid. The digestive system also get rid of waste material. The gastrointestinal system starts at the lips and ends at the anus. Animals like worms, insects, mammals, birds, fish, and human all have digestive systems. Passing gas during digesting is normal. The digestive system is not just the '''gut''', but also many other Organ (anatomy) which helps digest food. For example, digestive enzymes are needed to break down carbohydrates and meat into substances which can be absorbed. The absorbed food then goes to the rest of the body, and makes humans healthy. The parts of the human digestive system are the same in many animals: *Mouth *Pharynx *Oesophagus *Stomach *Intestines **Small intestine ***Duodenum ***Jejunum ***Ileum **Large intestine ***Cecum ***Colon (anatomy) *Rectum *Anus Other organs that are part of the gastrointestinal system but are ''not'' part of the gut are: *Liver and gall bladder *Pancreas *Salivary glands, lips, teeth, tongue, epiglottis, thyroid, and parathyroids Food does not go through these organs. But they help the gut digest the food. They also have other work. For example, the pancreas, thyroid, liver, and parathyroids are also endocrine glands that make hormones like insulin. There are many diseases that affect the gastrointestinal system. Medical doctor who study the gastrointestinal tract are called gastroenterology. They also study why people pass faeces excessively. == Related pages == * Appendix (anatomy) * Gastroenterology * nervous system * Polyp == References == - Category:Digestive system
