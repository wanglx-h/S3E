The name of the state comes from the Kaw people Native Americans, whose name comes from a Siouan-language phrase meaning "people of the south wind". The land that would become Kansas was bought in the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. Kansas's capital (city) is Topeka, Kansas, and its biggest city is Wichita, Kansas. Kansas was first settled by Americans in 1827 when Fort Leavenworth was built on the Missouri River. In the 1850s, more people came to live in Kansas. This was also when people were fighting about Slavery in the United States. People were allowed to move to Kansas in 1854 because of the Kansas–Nebraska Act. When this happened, abolitionism Free-Stater (Kansas) from New England and pro-slavery people from Missouri quickly came to Kansas. They wanted to decide whether Kansas would become a Slave states and free states. Because of this, a lot of fighting happened, and it was known as Bleeding Kansas. The anti-slavery people won. On January 29, 1861, Kansas entered the Union (American Civil War) as a free state--the thirty fourth state admitted to the United States. Kansas is in a region known as ''America's Breadbasket''. Like other states in this area, Kansas makes a lot of corn, sorghum, soybeans, and wheat; they make one-fifth of all wheat grown in the United States. Kansas has other wikt:industry too, including aviation and communications. Kansas has an area of , which is the List of U.S. states and territories by area. Kansas is also List of U.S. states and territories by population of the 50 states because 2,913,314 people live there. People who live in Kansas are called ''Kansans''. Mount Sunflower is Kansas's highest place at . The terrain of Kansas consists of prairies, minimal forests, with much land being farmed for grain crops. All of Kansas is in the Great Plains. ==Etymology== The name ''Kansas'' comes from the Algonquian languages term, ''Akansa'', for the Quapaw people. These were a Dhegiha Siouan-speaking people who moved to Arkansas around the 13th century. The stem -''kansa'' is named after the Kaw people. They are also known as the ''Kansa'', a federally recognized Native American tribe. ==History== ===Early history=== In 1539, Marcos de Niza, a friar, reported wikt:rumor of Quivira and Cíbola, a city of gold, to Spanish colonial officials in Mexico City. Niza said the city was in modern-day New Mexico. In response to the rumors, two years later, Francisco Vázquez de Coronado, with an army of 3000 Spain and 8001 Mexico, marched northward from Culiacán in hopes of finding the city. When Coronado did not find the city in New Mexico, he continued northeast into the Mississippi Valley, crossing the present area of Kansas diagonally. This made Conrado and his army the first Europeans to see the Great Plains, including Kansas. Later, Juan de Oñate also traveled to Kansas in 1601. In 1682, Jacques Marquette, Louis Jolliet, Louis Hennepin and other France leaders took wikt:formal control of the Mississippi Valley, including the land that would become Kansas. This land, known as the Louisiana territory, was used to organize trade with Native Americans. In 1763, France ceded the Louisiana territory to Spain. Between 1763 and 1803 the territory of Kansas was integrated into the Spanish Louisiana. The governor Luis de Unzaga 'le Conciliateur', during that period, promoted expeditions and good relations with the Native American tribes, among the explorers were Antoine de Marigny and others who continued trading across the Kansas River, especially at its confluence with the Missouri River, tributaries of the Mississippi River.Cazorla, Frank, G. Baena, Rosa, Polo, David, Reder Gadow, Marion (2019) Luis de Unzaga (1717-1793) Pioneer in the birth of the United States of America and in the liberalism. Foundation, Malaga However, in 1803, Spain receded the territory back to France in the Third Treaty of San Ildefonso. On April 30, 1803, Napoleon sold the Louisiana territory to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase. In the early 1800s, Kansas was used to hold Native Americans that were removed from their wikt:native lands. ===Statehood=== On May 30, 1854, the United States Congress signed the Kansas-Nebraska Act. The Kansas-Nebraska Act stated that Kansas and Nebraska were both territory of the United States. It also stated that Kansans would vote on the wikt:legality of slavery. Upon hearing this, about 1,200 armed New Englanders came to Kansas to vote against slavery. However, thousands of southerners, mostly from Missouri, came to vote for slavery. The final pre-statehood vote was to allow slavery, and Kansas adopted most of Missouri's slave laws. There was fighting between Southerners and Northerners in Kansas. In one fight, John Brown (abolitionist) and his men killed five people in the Pottawatomie Massacre. Later, Southerners destroyed Lawrence, Kansas. Kansas was called "Bleeding Kansas". Between 1854 and 1861, Kansas proposed four state constitutions. Out of the four proposed constitutions, three did not allow slavery. Finally, in July 1859, Kansas passed the Wyandotte Constitution, which was anti-slavery. The constitution for statehood was sent to the U.S. government in April 1860 to be voted on. The constitution was passed by the United States House of Representatives, but wikt:reject by the United States Senate. This is because southern voters in the Senate did not like that Kansas would become a state without slavery. In 1861, after the Confederate States of America states formed, the constitution gained approval from the Union (American Civil War), and Kansas became a state. ===Kansas in the Civil War=== File:Battle of Lawrence.png Four months after Kansas became a state, the American Civil War started. Out of the 381 battles in the Civil War, four were fought in Kansas. Throughout the war, Kansas remained a Union state. On August 21, 1863, William Clarke Quantrill led a force of 300 to 400 Confederates into the town of Lawrence, Kansas. Quantrill and his troops burned, looting, and destroyed the anti-slavery town. This battle became known as the Lawrence Massacre. In total, 164 Union soldiers and 40 Confederate soldiers died in the Lawrence Massacre. In the Battle of Mine Creek, on October 25, 1864, Union soldiers attacked Confederates as they were crossing the Mine Creek. The Union surrounded the Confederates, and captured 600 men and two generals. 1,000 Confederate soldiers and 100 Union soldiers died in the battle. In total, 8,500 people from Kansas died or were wounded in the Civil War. ===Post Civil War=== After the Civil War, many free slaves came to Oklahoma (before statehood) and Kansas. In fact, between the years of 1879 and 1881, about 60,000 African Americans came to this region. This is because the slaves wanted wikt:economic opportunities, which they believed awaited them in Kansas. African Americans also came to Kansas for better political rights and to wikt:escape sharecropping. These people were called "Exodusters." ===Recent history=== ====Dust Bowl==== From 1930 to 1936, western Kansas and surrounding areas went through a period of time called the Dust Bowl. During this time, Kansas had little rainfall and high temperatures. Thousands of farmers became very poor and had to move to other parts of the United States. In total, 400,000 people left the Great Plains area. The years from 1930 to 1940 was the only time the population of Kansas went down. The number of people living in Kansas decreased 4.3 percent. ====Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas==== During the 1950s, school Racial segregation was required in fifteen U.S. states. However, Kansas was not one of these states. Instead, school segregation was permitted by local option, but only in elementary schools. In 1896, the ruling from ''Plessy v. Ferguson'' stated that segregation was allowed, but equal facilities should be made available for blacks and whites. Often, however, black schools received less wikt:funding and had fewer wikt:textbooks than white schools. For these reasons, Linda Brown and her family sued the Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas, believing their school was not equal. Brown won the case before the U. S. Supreme Court, and the ruling overturned the ''Plessy v. Ferguson'' decision. This was considered by many a wikt:landmark case in the civil rights wikt:movement. ==Geography== File:Great Plains LCC (14285769265).jpg of Kansas]] File:Konza2.jpg Kansas is the 15th-largest state in the United States. It covers an area of 82,282 square miles (213,109km2). Of this, about 462 square miles (1196.57km2) are water. This makes up 0.60% of the total area of the state. Kansas shares borders with Nebraska to the north, Oklahoma to the south, Missouri to the east, and Colorado to the west. Kansas is just as far away from the Pacific Ocean as it is the Atlantic Ocean. The geographic center of the main 48 states is near Lebanon, Kansas. The geographic center of Kansas is in Barton County, Kansas. ===Geology=== The underground of Kansas is made of Dip slope sedimentary rocks, and they are slightly slanted west. A series of Mississippian, Pennsylvanian, and Permian rocks are found in the eastern and southern parts of the state. In the western part of Kansas, Cretaceous can be found sticking up from the ground. This happened because of the erosion from the Orogeny Rocky Mountains west of Kansas. Northeastern Kansas was affected by glaciation during the Pleistocene. ===Topography=== All of Kansas is in the Great Plains, where the land is mostly flat with prairies and grasslands. Eastern Kansas has hills and forests, like the Flint Hills and the Osage Plains in the southeastern part of the state. [File:Kanopolissp.JPG|thumb|Kanopolis State Park File:Pond in Kansas.jpg Kansas increases in elevation from east to west. The highest place in the state is Mount Sunflower near the Colorado border. Mount Sunflower is 4,039ft (1,231m) tall. The lowest point is the Verdigris River in Montgomery County, Kansas, at 679ft (207m) above sea level. It is a common misconception that Kansas is the flattest state – in 2003, a tongue-in-cheek study famously said the state is "flatter than a pancake". Kansas has a maximum topographic relief of . This makes Kansas the 23rd flattest U.S. state. ===Rivers=== File:Spring River 2006-07-03 2104.jpg, Kansas]] About of the Kansas's northeastern border is the Missouri River. The Kansas River is created by the junction of the Smoky Hill River and Republican River. This happens at Junction City, Kansas. The Kansas River then joins the Missouri River at Kansas City, Kansas. It goes across the northeastern part of the state. The Arkansas River (Arkansas River#Pronunciations) starts in Colorado. It goes for about across the western and southern parts of Kansas. Kansas's has other rivers. There is the Saline River (Kansas) and the Solomon River (Kansas). They are tributary of the Smoky Hill River. The Big Blue River (Kansas), the Delaware River (Kansas), and the Wakarusa River flow into the Kansas River. The Marais des Cygnes River is a tributary of the Missouri River. Spring River is between Riverton, Kansas and Baxter Springs, Kansas. ===National parks and historic places=== Areas under the protection of the National Park Service include: * Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site in Topeka * California National Historic Trail * Fort Larned National Historic Site in Larned, Kansas * Fort Scott National Historic Site * Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail * Nicodemus National Historic Site at Nicodemus, Kansas * Oregon National Historic Trail * Pony Express National Historic Trail * Santa Fe National Historic Trail * Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve near Strong City, Kansas ===Plants and animals=== In Kansas, there are currently 238 species of rare animals and 400 rare plants. Among those include: ''Boechera laevigata'', Virginia rail, Cleft Ledge, Osmunda regalis, Turkey-tangle, Bobolink, Cave salamander, Peregrine falcon, and Black-footed ferret. Common animal species and grasses include: Crows, Deer, Lesser prairie chicken, Mouse, Mole (animal), Opossum, Prairie dog, Raccoon, ''Tripsacum dactyloides'', Sporobolus heterolepis, Sorghastrum nutans, Schizachyrium scoparium, Switch grass, Chasmanthium latifolium, Carex stricta, Sideoats grama, and Big Bluestem. ==Weather== File:Kansas Köppen.svg File:Kansas Windmills.JPG File:Kansas Summer Wheat and Storm Panorama.jpg File:Wea00214 - Flickr - NOAA Photo Library.jpg in Manhattan, Kansas]] The Köppen climate classification says that Kansas's climate has three types depending on where in the state it is: it has humid continental, semi-arid steppe, and humid subtropical. The eastern 2/3 of the state (especially the northeastern part) has a humid continental climate. This means it has cool to cold winters and hot, often humid summers. Most of the precipitation happens during both the summer and the spring. The western 1/3 of the state – from about U.S. Route 83 to west of it – has a semi-arid climate steppe climate. Summers are hot, often very hot, and generally less humid. Winters vary a lot. Winters can be anything between warm and very cold. The western region gets an average of about of precipitation per year. Chinook winds in the winter can warm western Kansas all the way into the range. The far south-central and southeastern parts of Kansas, including the Wichita, Kansas area, have a humid subtropical climate. This means it has hot and humid summers, and it has milder winters. It also has more precipitation than other places in Kansas. Some things about three climates can be found in most of Kansas. Many parts can get droughts and varied weather. Places can be dry or humid. Places can get both warm or cold in the winter. Temperatures in many areas in the western half of Kansas reach or hotter on most days of June, July, and August. Because of the high humidity, the heat index can be deadly, especially in Wichita, Hutchinson, Kansas, Salina, Kansas, Russell, Kansas, Hays, Kansas, and Great Bend, Kansas. Temperatures are often high in Dodge City, Kansas, Garden City, Kansas, and Liberal, Kansas, but the heat index in those three cities is usually lower than the actual air temperature. Temperatures of or higher are not as common in the eastern half of Kansas. However, higher humidity and the urban heat island effect make most summer days reach between and in Topeka, Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas, and the Kansas City metropolitan area. During the summer, the low temperatures each night in the northeastern part of the state don't get colder than very often. Also, because of the humidity being between 85 and 95 percent, dangerous heat can be felt all day. Kansas has a wikt:varied climate with an average yearly temperature of 56°Fahrenheit (13°Celsius). The highest temperature ever in Kansas is 121°F (49.4°C). This happened in Fredonia, Kansas on July 18, 1936, and in Alton, Kansas on July 24, 1936. The lowest temperature ever in Kansas is -40°F (-40°C). This occurred in Lebanon, Kansas on February 13, 1905. Kansas is in a temperate area of the country. Like other states in this region, Kansas has four wikt:distinct seasons. Kansas can have wikt:extreme weather in all four seasons. For example, in spring and autumn, Kansas has many tornadoes. In fact, Kansas gets about 55 tornadoes per year. This is because Kansas is in the area known as Tornado Alley, where cold and warm air masses come together to make wikt:severe weather. In summer, Kansas has wikt:experienced severe droughts. For example, in 1934, 1936, and 1939, Kansas had less than average rainfall and widespread dust storms as a part of the Dust Bowl. In winter, Kansas has snow in most parts of the state. The average snowfall in the northern half of the state is 16 inches, with the average snowfall in the southern half of the state being 8inches. Blizzards and related snowstorms are rare in Kansas. {| class="wikitable" "text-align:center;font-size:90%;"| | colspan = "13" style="text-align:center;font-size:120%;background:#E8EAFA;"|Monthly Normal High and Low Temperatures For Various Kansas Cities |- ! style="background:#e5afaa; color:#000; height:17px;"| City ! style="background:#e5afaa; color:#000;"| Jan ! style="background:#e5afaa; color:#000;"| Feb ! style="background:#e5afaa; color:#000;"| Mar ! style="background:#e5afaa; color:#000;"| Apr ! style="background:#e5afaa; color:#000;"| May ! style="background:#e5afaa; color:#000;"| Jun ! style="background:#e5afaa; color:#000;"| Jul ! style="background:#e5afaa; color:#000;"| Aug ! style="background:#e5afaa; color:#000;"| Sep ! style="background:#e5afaa; color:#000;"| Oct ! style="background:#e5afaa; color:#000;"| Nov ! style="background:#e5afaa; color:#000;"| Dec |- ! style="background:#f8f3ca; color:#000; height:16px;"| Concordia | 36/17 | 43/22 | 54/31 | 64/41 | 74/52 | 85/62 | 91/67 | 88/66 | 80/56 | 68/44 | 51/30 | 40/21 |- ! style="background:#c5dfe1; color:#000; height:16px;"| Dodge City | 41/19 | 48/24 | 57/31 | 67/41 | 76/52 | 87/62 | 93/67 | 91/66 | 82/56 | 70/44 | 54/30 | 44/22 |- ! style="background:#f8f3ca; color:#000; height:16px;"| Goodland | 39/16 | 45/20 | 53/26 | 63/35 | 72/46 | 84/56 | 89/61 | 87/60 | 78/50 | 66/38 | 50/25 | 41/18 |- ! style="background:#c5dfe1; color:#000; height:16px;"| Topeka | 37/17 | 44/23 | 56/33 | 66/43 | 75/53 | 84/63 | 89/68 | 88/65 | 80/56 | 69/44 | 53/32 | 41/22 |- ! style="background:#f8f3ca; color:#000; height:16px;"| Wichita | 40/20 | 47/25 | 57/34 | 67/44 | 76/54 | 87/64 | 93/69 | 92/68 | 82/59 | 70/47 | 54/34 | 43/24 |- | colspan = "13" style="text-align:center;font-size:90%;background:#E8EAFA;"|''[http://countrystudies.us/united-states/weather/kansas/concordia.htm Concordia Weather - Kansas - Average Temperatures and Rainfall]'' ''[http://countrystudies.us/united-states/weather/kansas/dodge-city.htm Dodge City Weather - Kansas - Average Temperatures and Rainfall]'' ''[http://countrystudies.us/united-states/weather/kansas/goodland.htm Goodland Weather - Kansas - Average Temperatures and Rainfall]'' ''[http://countrystudies.us/united-states/weather/kansas/topeka.htm Topeka Weather - Kansas - Average Temperatures and Rainfall]'' ''[http://countrystudies.us/united-states/weather/kansas/wichita.htm Wichita Weather - Kansas - Average Temperatures and Rainfall]'' |} ==Cities and Counties== Kansas is organized into List of counties in Kansas.

In 2015, the job growth rate in was .8%. This was one of the lowest rate in America with only "10,900 total nonfarm jobs" added that year. The Kansas Department of Labor's 2016 report found the average yearly wage was $42,930 in 2015. In April 2016, the state's unemployment rate was 4.2%.

Overall, Kansas' GDP accounts for less than 1 percent of total U.S. economy. Kansas has three big military bases: Fort Riley, Fort Leavenworth, and McConnell Air Force Base. The US Army reserve has about 25,000 soldiers at these bases, and they also have about 8,000 civilian employees there. ===Agriculture=== File:09DI1525-23 - Flickr - USDAgov.jpg 40% of Kansas's economy is farming. In 2017, there were 58,569 farms in Kansas. In 2020, Kansas produced more grain sorghum and wheat than any other state in the United States. Kansas farmers produce about 400 million bushels of wheat per year. Kansas also ranks second in the United States in cropland and silage sorghum, third in cattle and raw meat, and fourth in sunflowers produced. Other agricultural products are cattle, sheep, wheat, sorghum, soybeans, cotton, pig, maize, and salt. 87.5% of Kansas's land is used for farming. As of 2018, there were 59,600 farms in Kansas, 86 (0.14%) of which are Organic certification. The size of the average farm in the state is 781 acres (more than a square mile). In 2016, the average cost of running the farm was $300,000. ===Industry=== The industrial products are transportation equipment, commercial and private aircraft, food processing, publishing, chemical products, machinery, clothes, petroleum, and mining. 4% of Kansas's GDP is from the aviation industry. Many parts of airplanes are made in Wichita. Also, many important companies are near Kansas City, Missouri. For example, the Sprint Nextel Corporation is one of the biggest telephone companies in the United States. Its main wikt:operational offices are in Overland Park, Kansas. ===Energy=== Kansas has many renewable resources. Kansas is one of the biggest producers of wind power in the United States. In 2019, Kansas had an installed capacity of about 6,100Megawatts(MW) from about 3,200 wind turbines. Wind produced the List of power stations in Kansas from the state at 41%. An additional 700MW of capacity was scheduled to become available during 2020. Kansas is also one of the biggest national producers of renewable ethanol and biodiesel fuels; Kansas produces about 600million gallons per year. Kansas is eighth in Petroleum in the United States. Production has slowly lowered because Kansas's limited economical reserves (especially from the Anadarko Basin) are being used up. Since Price of oil reached their lowest level in 1999, oil production in Kansas has remained about the same; it had an average monthly rate of about in 2004. The Oil price increases since 2003 have made carbon sequestration and other oil recovery techniques more economical. Kansas is also eighth in US natural gas production. Production has slowly lowered since the mid-1990s with the slow depletion of the Hugoton Natural Gas Area—the state's biggest field which extends into Oklahoma and Texas. In 2004, slower declines in the Hugoton gas fields and increased coalbed methane production contributed to a smaller overall decline. Average monthly production was over . ===Taxes=== During his campaign for the 2010 election, Governor Sam Brownback said he would get rid of the state income tax. In May 2012, Governor Brownback signed into law the '''Kansas Senate Bill Substitute HB 2117'''. Starting in 2013, the "ambitious tax overhaul" lowered income tax, got rid of some corporate taxes, and created Flow-through entity tax exemptions. He raised the sales tax by one percent to make up for the loss of the other taxes. However, the sales tax was not enough to make up for it. He made cuts to education and some state services to make up for the lost revenue. The tax cut led to years of budget shortfalls. The worst was a $350 million budget shortfall in February 2017. From 2013 to 2017, 300,000 businesses were considered to be pass-through income entities and benefited from the tax exemption. The tax reform "encouraged tens of thousands of Kansans to claim their wages and salaries as income from a business rather than from employment." The economic growth that Brownback hoped for never happened. He argued that it was because of "low wheat and oil prices and a fewer aircraft sales." The state general fund debt load was $83 million in fiscal year 2010. By fiscal year 2017 the debt load sat at $179 million. In 2016, Governor Brownback earned the title of "most unpopular governor in America". Only 26 percent of Kansas voters approved of his job performance. 65 percent said they did not. In the summer of 2016, S&P Global Ratings downgraded Kansas's credit rating. In February 2017, S&P lowered it to AA-. In February 2017, a bi-partisan group wrote a bill that would repeal the pass-through income exemption, the "most important provisions of Brownback's overhaul", and raise taxes to make up for the budget shortfall. Brownback vetoed the bill but "45 GOP legislators had voted in favor of the increase, while 40 voted to uphold the governor's veto." On June 6, 2017 a group of Democrats and newly elected Republicans overrode Brownback's veto. They increased taxes to an amount that is close to what it was before 2013. Brownback's tax plan was described in a June 2017 article in ''The Atlantic'' as the United States' "most aggressive experiment in conservative economic policy". The tax cuts had made schools and infrastructure difficult to get funding in Kansas. ==Transportation== File:I35Kansas.jpg as it enters Kansas in Rosedale, Kansas.]] ===Highways=== There are two Interstate Highway System in Kansas.
