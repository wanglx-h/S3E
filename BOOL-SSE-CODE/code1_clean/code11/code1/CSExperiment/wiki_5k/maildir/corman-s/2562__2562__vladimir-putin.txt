Putin also served as Prime Minister of Russia from 1999 to 2000 and again from 2008 to 2012. At 24 years, 11 months and 29 days, he is the longest-serving Russian or Soviet leader since the 30-year tenure of Joseph Stalin. He originally trained as a Masters of Business Administration and KGB Agent in the mid ranks. ==Early life== Putin was born on 7 October 1952, in Leningrad, Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, Soviet Union (now Saint Petersburg, Russia) during the rule of Joseph Stalin. His parents were Vladimir Spiridonovich Putin (1911–1999) and Maria Ivanovna Putina (''née'' Shelomova; 1911–1998). Spiridon Putin, Vladimir Putin's grandfather, was a cook to Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin. ==Early career== From 1985 to 1990, Putin worked for the KGB, the Soviet Union's secret spy service. Putin worked in Dresden, which was part of the former German Democratic Republic. After East Germany collapsed in 1989, Putin was told to come back to the Soviet Union. He chose to go to Leningrad, which is where he went to university. In June 1990, he started working in the International Affairs section of Leningrad State University. In June 1991, he was appointed head of the International Committee of the Saint Petersburg Mayor's office. His job was to promote international relations and foreign investments. Putin gave up his position in the KGB on August 20, 1991, during the putsch against Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. In 1994, he became First Deputy Chairman of the city of Saint Petersburg. In August 1996, he came to Moscow, and served in a variety of important positions in Boris Yeltsin's government. He was head of the FSB (a secret spy service in modern capitalist Russia) from July 1998 to August 1999, and he was Secretary of the Security Council from March to August 1999. ==President of Russia== File:Vladimir Putin at APEC Summit in China 19-21 October 2001-10.jpg Mahathir Mohamad in 2001.]] Putin became President of Russia in May 2000. Putin is the leader of the ruling United Russia party. This party has been winning the Russian elections ever since the fall of the Soviet Union. Critics of Putin say that he has taken away people's freedoms, and that he has failed to make the country more developed. Russia makes lots of money from selling oil and gas to other countries, but because of corruption, this money is not used for improving living conditions. On 16 October 2007, Putin visited Iran to participate in the Second Caspian Summit in Tehran,[http://top.rbc.ru/politics/16/10/2007/122607.shtml Putin: Iran Has Right to Develop Peaceful Nuclear Programme] , 16 October 2007, Rbc.ru where he met with Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. This was the first visit of a Soviet or Russian leader to Iran since Joseph Stalin's participation in the Tehran Conference in 1943, and marked a significant event in Iran–Russia relations.[https://web.archive.org/web/20080726124113/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article2666142.ece Vladimir Putin defies assassination threats to make historic visit to Tehran], 16 October 2007, ''The Times''. Recently, the Russian opposition has held anti-government rallies, campaigned against Putin on the Internet, and published independent reports for the general public. Because of censorship in the mass media, it's very difficult to get different information out to the public. Putin was against invading Libya in 2011. He is also against invading Syria and Iran. On March 24, 2014, Putin and Russia were suspended from the G8. This was because the United States thought that the Euromaidan was Putin's fault. According to the Constitution of Russia, no-one can be president three times in a row. Because of this, Putin didn't put himself forward for the March 2008 election. However, you're allowed to be president as many times as you want, as long as it's not for more than two times in a row. In March 2012, Putin put himself forward for the elections, and won 64% of the vote. This means that he was the president of Russia until 2018. On December 6, 2017, Russia President Vladimir Putin announced he would run for a fourth term in the upcoming election, 2018 Russian Presidential Election. In July 2020, Russian voters backed a referendum that would allow Putin to serve as president until 2036. On 24 February 2022, Putin announced that his military was going to 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine Ukraine with the goal of protecting Russian citizens in Ukraine. This happened after a year of 2021–2022 Russo-Ukrainian crisis between the two countries. It led to him being called a war criminal by the international community. ==Personal life== He is a member of the Russian Orthodox Church, and is divorced with two daughters. ==References== ==Bibliography== === Other sources === *Burrett, Tina.
