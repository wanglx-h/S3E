It has been under the rule of various empires throughout history, mostly the Persian Empires. In the year 800, Islam came to north-east of Iran, (Nowadays called a part of this Land Tajikistan) In 1868, Tajikistan became a Russian Colony. It later became a part of the Soviet Union. On 9 September 1991, after long periods of mass protests against the Soviet Government, the Parliament of Tajikistan declared independence from Soviet Union, and held the first presidential elections. Rahmon Nabiev, who ran the country during Soviet Union in the late 1970s and early 1980s, became its president. He was unable to bring any much-needed reforms to the country, and so there were protests in the capital city, Dushanbe. The government responded by organizing a pro-government demonstration, mainly made of old Communist Party members and people from the southeast of the country brought to the city. Anti-government protests did not stop, so the government gave weapons to the pro-government demonstrator. Then the Opposition armed themselves. After this bloody civil war broke out.

After the September 11, 2001 attacks, many American and French Soldiers came into the country. == Political structure == In 2010 a leaked US Embassy cable described Tajikistan as "... The greatest obstacle to improving the economy is resistance to reform. From the President down to the policeman on the street, the government is characterized by cronyism and corruption. Emomali Rahmon and his family control the country's major businesses, including the largest bank, and they play hardball to protect their business interests, no matter the cost to the economy writ large... The government has limited opposition party operations and rejected electoral law reforms for the February 28, 2010, parliamentary elections. The Embassy does not expect the elections to be free and fair. There has been almost no coverage of opposition political parties by state media, and most of the population is unaware of the purpose of the elections..."
