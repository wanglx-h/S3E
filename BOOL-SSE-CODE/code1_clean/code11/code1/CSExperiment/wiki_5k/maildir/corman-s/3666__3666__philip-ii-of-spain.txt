He was born in Valladolid and was the only son of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and his wife to live until he was an adult. He was strongly Catholic. His rule was filled with troubles since his war against the Dutch Republic was expensive and unsuccessful, and his Spanish Armada was defeated and destroyed, which caused him to be harsh to his subjects. == Childhood == For the first seven years of his life, Philip moved between different castles with his mother. In 1534 he moved into a private house in Salamanca to start his schooling. His mother died in 1539 and he took her body to Granada, where his great-grandparents Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella were buried. He left Spain in 1547 and moved to the Netherlands, where his father's family was from. His father wanted him to become more European but the people there thought he was too cold and serious. == Marriages and children == * He married his cousin, Maria of Portugal of Portugal, in (1543), They were both 16 years old. She gave him a son, Carlos, Prince of Asturias (1545-1568) but died a few days later. * Philip wanted to marry an English queen, Queen Elizabeth I of England, who was Protestant. However, she refused to marry him. * Instead, he married her Catholic half-sister, Queen Mary I of England in 1554. This made him King Consort while she lived. Her people did not like the marriage, and Philip saw it only as a politics move. On January 16, 1556, Philip became King of Spain when his father Abdication but Philip chose to stay out of the country until his father died, two years later. Mary I of England died in 1558 without children. * Philip believed his son, Carlos, Prince of Asturias had planned his death, so he put Don Carlos in jail. The prince died soon after, so Philip's enemies said that he had ordered someone to kill him. Some evidence shows this, but it was probably too much eating and drinking that killed Don Carlos. ==Titles/styles/honors== Phillip II obtained most of his titles from his parents.
