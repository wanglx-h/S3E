'''Game Boy Advance Video''' is a format of cartridges for the Game Boy Advance. They work the same as normal cartridge but play television programme instead of games. They generally contain 45 minutes of TV, for example, a show from Nickelodeon or Cartoon Network. They were first made in early 2004, but gradually stopped being made shortly before there were no more Game Boy Advance games made in 2008, with the final game for it being Samurai Deeper KYO (video game).https://www.amazon.com/Samurai-Deeper-KYO-Game-Boy-Advance/dp/B001766RFS == References == == Other websites == *[http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/gameboyadvance/agb_video.jsp Nintendo customer service for GBA video] *[http://www.gba-video.com GBA-Video.com] Category:Game Boy
