They formed in Vermont in 1983, broke up in 2004, and reformed in 2009. Their lead singer is Trey Anastasio. Phish was often compared to the Grateful Dead, and had a similar following of "Phish Heads" following the band on tour. They went on a 5-year-long hiatus from 2004 to 2009. Their hiatus ended when they played shows on March 6, 7 and 8 at the Hampton Coliseum in Hampton, VA. The band surprised the audience with longer sets than usual. Their music has a lot of improvisation, so when they play live, their songs are sometimes a lot longer. They use elements from many genres, including Rock music, jazz, funk, progressive rock, bluegrass, country music, reggae, blues, Latin music, and psychedelic rock. ==Discography== ;Studio albums * ''Phish (album)'' (1986) * ''The Man Who Stepped into Yesterday'' (1987) * ''Junta (album)'' (1989) * ''Lawn Boy'' (1990) * ''A Picture of Nectar'' (1992) * ''Rift'' (1993) * ''Hoist (album)'' (1994) * ''Billy Breathes'' (1996) * ''The Story of the Ghost'' (1998) * ''The Siket Disc'' (1999) * ''Farmhouse'' (2000) * ''Round Room'' (2002) * ''Undermind'' (2004) * ''Joy'' (2009) * ''Fuego'' (2014) * Big Boat (2016) * Sigma Oasis (2020) * Evolve (2024) ==References== Category:American rock bands Category:Musical groups established in 1983 Category:2004 disestablishments in the United States Category:Burlington, Vermont Category:1983 establishments in the United States Category:20th-century establishments in Vermont
