'''No''' is an English language word that has a wikt:negative meaning. It is the opposite of the word ''yes'', which is a wikt:positive term. ''No'' is used when someone is turning away something. It is also used when opposing an idea. It can also be used in different figure of speech. In both sentences and talking, the words "No" and the word "Not" can both be used, though the word "No" is mainly used when speaking to other people. In some cases, however, "Not" is not acceptable, and vice versa. These words are not to be confused with the similar sounding words know and knot. Examples of of "No" and "Not": *Is this green? No, it is not. *There is no way round the back. * This is not the way (but there is another way). * I will not come. * Oh, no! * No, thank you. * Not on my watch! * I can not go anywhere. Examples of of "No" and "Not": * That is no the way you do it. * Oh not! * I know how to tie a knot. ''(Disambiguation)'' * I didn't no that! * I can no go. * Not way! When there are multiple "no's" in a sentence, if the number of "no's" is even then the "no's" together mean "yes" (because when saying "no no", the first ''no'' cancels the second ''no''). If the number of "no"'s is odd then together they mean "no". Category:Basic English 850 words
