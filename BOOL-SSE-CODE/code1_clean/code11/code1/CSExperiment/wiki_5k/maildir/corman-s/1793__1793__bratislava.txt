About 450,000 people live there. It used to be called Pressburg (German) or Pozsony (Hungarian) and by some other names. Bratislava is the seat of the national government, the presidency, and the parliament. It has several museums, galleries, and other educational, cultural, and economic institutions. There is a small Old Town and a castle called Bratislavský Hrad. The Danube river goes through Bratislava. == Etymology == Bratislava had many names through its history. Here are some of them: * German language: ''Preßburg'' (now spelled ''Pressburg'') * Slovak language: ''Prešporok'', from German name * Hungarian language: ''Pozsony'' (still used today by Hungarians) * Greek language (medieval): ''Istropolis'' (meaning the Danube City) * Latin: ''Posonium'' * English language: ''Pressburg(h)''/''Pressborough'' and many others. == Geography == Bratislava is in the extreme southwest of Slovakia, on the borders with Austria and Hungary, and not far from the Czech Republic border. It is on the Morava (river) and Danube rivers. == History == People have lived here since the Neolithic age. The Celts inhabited this area from 400 BC-50 BC. The Roman Empire set up border military camps near Bratislava from the 1st century until the 5th century, for example,"''Gerulata''." The Slavs started moving here in the 6th century. Bratislava was part of the Slavic empire called Great Moravia in the 9th century. From the second half of the 10th century until 1918, it was part of the Kingdom of Hungary, with some exceptions. It was even the capital of the Kingdom between 1524 and 1830/1848. After the World War I ended in 1918, it was part of newly founded Czechoslovakia until 1939, when it became the capital of World War II the Slovak Republic until 1945. After 1945, it was part of Czechoslovakia again, becoming the capital of Slovak Socialist Republic (which was still part of Czechoslovakia) in 1968. After the event called Velvet Divorce, when Czechoslovakia broke up, Bratislava became the capital of Slovakia. == Population == == Sightseeing == File:Hlavné námestie-The napoleonic soldier, Old Town Hall and Roland Fountain-Bratislava.JPG List of notable structures: * Bratislava Castle * St. Martin's Cathedral * Primate's Palace * Bratislava town hall * Michael's Gate * Grassalkovich Palace * Nový Most (New Bridge) * Kamzík TV Tower * Devín Castle == Economy == The economy of Bratislava is prosperous and based on the automobile industry, chemical industry, and services.
