The city has a population of over 630,000 and is the largest city in British Columbia. Metro Vancouver has a population of over 2 million people, which makes it the third-largest metropolitan area in Canada. Vancouver has a mix of people from different cultures, and 52% of its residents have a first language that is not English language. == History == Indigenous peoples began living in this area around 10,000-8,000 years ago. These people were part of three main groups: the Squamish, Musqueam, and Tsleil-Waututh. Vancouver was founded in 1886, and is named after the British naval captain George Vancouver, who explored the area around Vancouver and Vancouver Island in the 1790s. == Cityscape == The University of British Columbia is in Vancouver. Vancouver also has Stanley Park, which has beaches and totemism. Nearby is Grouse Mountain, which has good skiing and has a 2.9km (1.8mi.) hiking trail which is known as the Grouse Grind. Grouse Mountain also has an animal sanctuary, including wolf and bears. The Lions Gate Bridge is also in Stanley Park. == Sports == File:General Motors Place.jpg is the home of the Vancouver Canucks]] Vancouver has two ice hockey teams: the Vancouver Canucks, who play for the National Hockey League, and the Vancouver Giants, who play for the Western Hockey League. The BC Lions of the Canadian Football League are based in Vancouver. The team has won six Grey Cups. In Association football, Vancouver is home to the Vancouver Whitecaps FC, who play in the Major League Soccer (MLS). The 2010 Winter Olympics were held in Vancouver, and it was the first time Canada won a gold medal in the Olympics on Canadian soil. == Geography == Vancouver is on a peninsula on the West Coast of Canada, less than a one-hour drive north of the Canada-U.S. border. Between Vancouver and the Pacific Ocean, to the west, is a large island called Vancouver Island. Until the city was named in 1885, "Vancouver" referred to Vancouver Island. Some people mistakenly think that the city is on Vancouver Island. On the south shore of Vancouver is the Fraser River, which flows west into the Strait of Georgia. The water along the north shore is called Burrard Inlet. The city has an area of 114square kilometres (44square mile). The larger metropolitan area is 2,878square kilometres (1,111sqmi). As with most of British Columbia, Vancouver is in the Pacific Time Zone (UTC−8). === Climate === Vancouver has an oceanic climate (''Cfb'' in the Köppen climate classification). The average precipitation per year is 1189mm, mostly from October to April. High temperatures in the summer average 22°C. The highest temperature ever recorded was 34.4°C on July 30, 2009.
