He wrote a number of novels, on various themes. Most of his books are about modern society, the effects of modern science and, later, on mysticism and psychedelic drugs like LSD. Huxley is probably best known for his book ''Brave New World''. In the book, which was written in 1932, he writes about a world in the far future, where the whole social hierarchy is based on genetic traits, and not on the personal effort of individual people to improve themselves. == Selected works == === Novels === * ''Crome Yellow'' (1921) * ''Antic Hay'' (1923) * ''Those Barren Leaves'' (1925) * ''Point Counter Point'' (1928) * ''Brave New World'' (1932) * ''Eyeless in Gaza'' (1936) * ''After Many a Summer'' (1939) * ''Time Must Have a Stop'' (1944) * ''Ape and Essence'' (1948) * ''The Genius and the Goddess'' (1955) * ''Island'' (1962) === Essay collections === * ''On the Margin'' (1923) * ''Along the Road'' (1925) * ''Essays New and Old'' (1926) * ''Proper Studies'' (1927) * ''Do What You Will'' (1929) * ''Vulgarity in Literature'' (1930) * ''Music at Night'' (1931) * ''Texts and Pretexts'' (1932) * ''The Olive Tree and other essays'' (1936) * ''Ends and Means'' (1937) * ''Words and their Meanings'' (1940) * ''The Art of Seeing'' (1942) * ''The Perennial Philosophy'' (1945) * ''Science, Liberty and Peace'' (1946) * ''Themes and Variations'' (1950) * ''The Doors of Perception'' (1954) * ''Heaven and Hell'' (1956) * ''Adonis and the Alphabet'' (U.S. title: ''Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow'') (1956) * ''Collected Essays'' (1958) * ''Brave New World Revisited'' (1958) * ''Literature and Science'' (1963) * ''Moksha: Writings on Psychedelics and the Visionary Experience 1931–63'' (1977) * ''The Human Situation: Lectures at Santa Barbara, 1959'' (1977) ===Screenplays=== * ''Brave New World'' * ''Ape and Essence'' * ''Pride and Prejudice'' (Collaboration. 1940) * ''Madame Curie'' (Collaboration. 1943) * ''Jane Eyre'' (Collaboration with John Houseman. 1944) * ''A Woman's Vengeance'' 1947 * ''Eyeless in Gaza'' (BBC Mini-series 1971) === Audio Recordings on CD === * ''Knowledge and Understanding'' (1955) * ''Who Are We?''
