It has recently become a secular country, but before it was the only Hinduism Kingdom in the world. Nepal is a very important pilgrimage place for both Hindus and Buddhists. The population of Nepal in 2021 was almost 29 million people. A Unique and Diverse Country in South Asia|url=http://www.gairegaurav.com.np/2021/06/nepal-unique-and-diverse-country.html|access-date=2021-06-19|language=English}}nations encyclopedia, nepal, 2013, http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/economies/Asia-and-the-Pacific/Nepal.html Nepali language is the official language of the country, but there are many other regional languages in Nepal. Many people in Nepal understand English language and Hindi as well. The capital city of Nepal is Kathmandu, which has a population of over 1.4 million people. The second-largest city is Pokhara. Pokhara is a major tourist attraction of Nepal which is rich in natural beauty. Pokhara includes many lakes, Phewa Tal is one of them. == Geography == File:ACAP Upper Mustang Tangyejpg.jpg Nepal is a Landlocked, which means it is not next to any ocean, and it is surrounded by India and China. Eight of the ten List of highest mountains, including Mount Everest, are in Nepal. Mount Everest is on the border Nepal shares with China. Nepal is a little smaller than Illinois and Bangladesh, but a little bigger than Kyrgyzstan. It also has the second-highest average elevation in the world at (10,715ft), only behind Bhutan. == Economy == Nepal used to be an agricultural country until 1950. Since 1951 it entered the modern era and has made progress. Agriculture, however, is still a major economic activity. 80% of the people do agricultural works and it provides 37% of GDP. Only about 20% of the total area is cultivable while another 33% is covered by forest. Most of the remaining land is covered by mountains. Rice and wheat are the main food crops. The lowland Terai region produces a high amount of agricultural products. A part of those products is supplied to the hill areas, which produces less. China is the 2nd largest exporter to Nepal, but its imports from Nepal are zero. This burdens Nepal's monetary stability and monetary balance. India is the largest buyer of Nepal's goods.The yearly monsoon rain, or lack of it, strongly influences economic growth. From 1996 to 1999, real GDP growth averaged less than 4%. The growth rate recovered in 1999, rising to 6% before slipping slightly in 2001 to 5.5%. Nepal has 1/3 of its trade with India. ==Demographics== File:Chhetri ladies.png in Hindu outfit]] File:Tamang Woman 2.JPG The people of Nepal belong to two main groups; Indo-Aryan group and Tibeto-Burman group. Indo-Aryans are mostly Hindus and Sikhs and they celebrate Hindu and Sikh festivals like Dashain, Tihar, Vaisakhi, Gurpurabs, Maghi, Hola, Bandi Chhor diwas, Teej, Magh Sankranti, Krishna Janmastami, Holi, Janai Purnima, Matatirtha Aunsi, Chhath, etc. Tibeto-Burmans are Buddhist and they celebrate Lhosar, Buddha Jayanti, etc. == Education == File:Students of Janata Primary School, northern Tistung.JPG Modern education in Nepal started with the opening of the first school in 1853. This school was only for the members of the ruling families and their courtiers. Schooling for the general people began only after 1951. It was when a popular movement ended the Autocracy Rana family regime and started a democratic system. In the past 50 years, there has been a big expansion of education facilities in the country. As a result, adult literacy (age 15+) of the country was reported to be 48.2% (female: 34.6%, male: 62.2%) in the Population Census, 2001, up from about 5% in 1952–54. In the beginning in 1951, there were about 300 schools and two colleges with around 10,000 students. Now, there are more than 26,000 schools (including higher secondary), 415 colleges, five universities, and two academies of higher studies. In total, 5.5 million students are studying in those schools and colleges who are taught by more than 150,000 teachers. Despite such examples of success, there are many problems and challenges. Education management, quality, usefulness, and access are some of the major issues of education in Nepal. Social differences based on gender, ethnicity, location, economic class, etc. are still there in some places. Lack of resources has always been a problem in education. These problems have made the goal of education for all a challenge for the country. ==Administrative subdivisions== File:New Map of Nepal District and Province.svg Nepal has seven provinces.
