It shares a border with Northern Ireland (which is part of the United Kingdom). The country is sometimes called the '''Republic of Ireland''' to distinguish it from the island. It is a member of the European Union. The republic's Capital (city) is Dublin. Cork (city) is the second largest city in the country and the third largest on the island of Ireland. The population of Ireland is 4.9 million. English language is the main language spoken. The Irish language is widely taught in all schools, and it is still spoken as a first language in some areas of the country, known as the Gaeltacht. Irish is the first official language, followed by English. == History == === Summary === Several hundred years ago, the English took over the country and made it part of the United Kingdom in 1801. After many years of revolution, Ireland gained its independence from the United Kingdom in 1922 and has been an independent country since then. It was a neutral country during World War II. === Home Rule Movement === From January 1, 1801 to December 6, 1922, Ireland was part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. During the Great Famine (Ireland) (1845–1849), Ireland's population dropped by about 30%. Around 1 million people died from hunger and disease, and 1.5 million emigrated, mainly to the United States. This started a long period of emigration, with the population continuing to fall until the 1960s. In 1874, and especially under Charles Stewart Parnell from 1880, the Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP) became important. The party worked in two main ways: * Agrarian (land) protests through the Irish Land League, which helped farmers get better rights through the Irish Land Acts. * Political work for Home Rule – trying to get limited self-government for Ireland. Two Home Rule Bills were introduced but both failed. However, these efforts led to more local control of Irish matters through the Local Government Act of 1898, which took power from the mainly Protestant landlords (called the Protestant Ascendancy) and gave it to local Irish councils. By 1911, Home Rule seemed likely. That year, the Parliament Act took away the House of Lords' power to block new laws. In 1914, John Redmond and the IPP finally got the Third Home Rule Act passed. But there was a big problem: strong opposition from Unionists, especially in Ulster, where many people were Protestant and the economy was more industrial than in the rest of mainly rural Ireland. Unionists, who feared being ruled by Irish Catholics and losing their social and economic position, had grown in strength since 1886. In Ulster, Protestants were the majority in four counties. They formed a group called the Ulster Volunteers to resist Irish Home Rule, led by Edward Carson (from Dublin) and James Craig (from Ulster). To avoid a civil war in Ulster after the Home Rule Act passed in May 1914, British Prime Minister Herbert Asquith created an Amending Bill. It allowed Ulster to be temporarily excluded from Home Rule for six years, with a new plan to be made later for how Ulster would be governed. == Geography and economy== The state extends over an area of about five-sixths (70,273 km2 or 27,133 sq mi) of the island of Ireland (84,421 km2 or 32,595 sq mi), with Northern Ireland being the rest. Ireland is one of the countries in Europe with the least forests. Today, only about 10% of Ireland is covered with forests. The total land area dedicated to farming is 64%. Before 2002, the currency was Irish pound, which was historically tied to pound sterling.Mr. Hegarty in the Dáil: "With regard to our entry into the EMS we are glibly assuming that the Irish £ will appreciate against sterling on our entry. On reading a paper this morning I noticed that the opposite is true. In the first market opened by Barclays the Irish £ depreciated".

Higgins 2006.jpg, Michael D. Higgins]] The head of State, the President of Ireland, is elected for seven years by the adult citizens. The same president can only be elected twice (14 years). Most of the president's tasks are representing and ceremonial ones. The president has little power over the government. Ireland is a democracy and people vote for their representatives. The Taoiseach (equivalent to a prime minister) is selected by the parliament. The Taoiseach is usually the head of the biggest party. The Oireachtas (equivalent to the parliament) consists of the Dáil Éireann (the lower House) and the Seanad (the 'upper House'). The system is similar to that of France or the United States, except that the President is not an executive. It is closely modelled on the Parliament of the United Kingdom, with the executive appointed from within the lower house, and the head of State is the President in Ireland serving a similar function as the Monarch in the UK. The main political parties in Ireland are Sinn Féin (25%), Fianna Fail (22%), Fine Gael (21%), the Labour Party (5%) and others. ===Local government=== The Local Government Act 1898 is the founding document of the present system of local government, while the Twentieth Amendment to the constitution of 1999 given for its Constitution recognition. The twenty-six traditional counties of Ireland are not always related to governmental divisions although they are usually used as a geographical frame of reference by the population of Ireland. Below this (with the exception of the Dublin Region and the three City council) are municipal districts. {| style="margin: 1em auto;" |- | valign="top" | {| style="margin:auto;" cellpadding="10" |- | File:Ireland Administrative Counties.svg |style="font-size: 85%; font-weight:bold;"| # Fingal County Council # Dublin City Council # Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council # South Dublin County Council # Wicklow County Council # Wexford County Council # Carlow County Council # Kildare County Council # Meath County Council # Louth County Council # Monaghan County Council # Cavan County Council # Longford County Council # Westmeath County Council # Offaly County Council # Laois County Council |style="font-size: 85%; font-weight:bold;"| Kilkenny County Council Waterford City and County Council Cork City Council Cork County Council Kerry County Council Limerick City and County Council Tipperary County Council Clare County Council Galway County Council Galway City Council Mayo County Council Roscommon County Council Sligo County Council Leitrim County Council Donegal County Council |} |} ==Related pages== *Ireland at the Olympics *Ireland national football team *List of rivers of Ireland ==References== '''Notes''' Category:Republic of Ireland Category:European Union member states Category:English-speaking countries Category:1949 establishments in Europe
