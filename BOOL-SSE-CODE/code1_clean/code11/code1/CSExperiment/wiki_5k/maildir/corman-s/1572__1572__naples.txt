There were so many Greeks there, the Romans called it ''Magna Graecia'', which means "Greater Greece."The Oxford Companion to Classical Literature, Paul Harvey, 1927,1955, p258 Later the Romans conquered southern Italy and took Naples. When the Roman Empire fell to invaders in the west, Naples came under the rule of the Byzantine Empire, the Greek-speaking Eastern Roman Empire. Naples became independent later but was combined with the Kingdom of Sicily during the Middle Ages. By 1500 it was ruled by Aragón, which was a kingdom in eastern Spain. Later, Naples became part of Spain when Aragon and the other kingdom in Spain called Castile became one country. Naples was part of this Kingdom of Spain until the Austrian Empire got it in the War of the Spanish Succession in 1714. In the 19th century it was the capital of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. The Duchy of Savoy, or kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont, conquered Naples in 1861. That kingdom became the Kingdom of Italy. Naples was heavily bombed when Italy fought in World War Two and British/American armies tried to capture it. Today Naples is the capital of Campania and the largest city in southern Italy. == Climate == The average temperature in the summer is 24Celsius. In the winter, the average can be as low as 8Celsius.
