Subject: Subtraction
'''Subtraction''' is the arithmetic operation for finding the :wikt:difference between two numbers, though it can also be generalized to other mathematical objects such as vectors and Matrix (mathematics). The names of the numbers in a subtraction expression are: \textrm{minuend}-\textrm{subtrahend}=\textrm{difference}. For example, the expression 7-4=3 can be read as "7 (number) minus 4 (number) equals 3 (number)", "seven take away four leaves three", or "four from seven leaves three". If the minuend is less than the subtrahend, the difference will be a negative number. For example, 17-25=-8. This can be read as "17 (number) minus 25 (number) equals negative 8 (number)". Subtraction is how cash registers determine the Change (money) a buyer receives, when the buyer pays with more money than the purchase cost. ==Properties== ===Anti-commutativity=== Subtraction is anti-commutative, meaning that swapping the numbers around the minus sign will give a number with the same Operation (mathematics)#Absolute value, but the opposite Sign (mathematics)#Sign of a number (Operation (mathematics)#Additive inverses (opposites)): :a-b=-(b-a) ===Non-associativity=== Subtraction is 'not' associativity, which comes up when one tries to define repeated subtraction. In general, the expression :a-b-c means (a-b)-c or a-(b-c), but these two possibilities lead to different answers. To resolve this issue, one must establish an order of operations, with different orders yielding different results. ===Predecessor=== In the context of Integer, subtraction of one also plays a special role: for any integer a, the integer a-1 is the largest integer that is smaller than a, also known as the predecessor of a. ==Related pages== * Operation (mathematics)#Addition * Operation (mathematics)#Division * Negative number * Order of operations == References == Category:Arithmetics
