The Capital (city) is Schwerin. As of 2016, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania had about 1,612,000 people. It made part of former East Germany. It is the most northeastern state of Germany. It borders the Baltic Sea in the north, Poland in the east, Brandenburg in the south, Lower Saxony in the southwest and Schleswig-Holstein in the west. Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania is low-lying and has many rivers, canals and lakes. The Stettin Lagoon lies partly in this state and partly in Poland. The state hosts the biggest German island called Rügen, and the second biggest German lake called Müritz. == Politics == Seats in the state parliament (''Landtag'') since 2016: * SPD: 26 * AfD: 18 * CDU: 16 * Die Linke: 11 Total: 71 seats File:Schwerin Castle Aerial View Island Luftbild Schweriner Schloss Insel See.jpg'']] == Cities == The largest city/towns in the state are: * Rostock * Greifswald * Stralsund * Schwerin * Neubrandenburg * Güstrow Besides Rostock all have a population of less than 200,000.
