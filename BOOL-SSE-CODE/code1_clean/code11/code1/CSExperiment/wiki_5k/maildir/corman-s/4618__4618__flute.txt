File:Flute.jpg The '''flute''' is a musical instrument. A person who plays the flute is called a ''flautist''. There are many kinds of flutes.Sugita.co.jp, [http://www.sugita.co.jp/new_page_41.htm フルートの選び方 (Choice of flute)] ; retrieved 2012-6-19. The most common concert flute is on C tuning. In addition, there are other flutes like piccolos, alto flutes, and bass flutes. Flutes have changed over time. Pan flutes were made for many centuries. Later, the "Renaissance flute" came into use. In Baroque music ''flute'' means recorder, so flutes were called ''traverso'' in order not to confuse them. A Bavarian flute maker named Boehm reformed flutes largely to enlarge the volume and improve the way of using the chromatic scale. Later improvements created the modern flute. There is a large repertoire of music for the flute. Baroque composers used them in their orchestras, usually in pairs, and composed concertos, chamber music and solo music for them. This has continued to the present day. Orchestras have at least 2 flutes each, sometimes three or four. Sometimes there is 1 piccolo which plays an octave higher, or an alto flute which plays a musical intervals lower than the flute. The flute sounds very bright and cheerful playing high notes. Please listen, for example, to the ''Badinerie'' from Johann Sebastian Bach ''Orchestral Suite no 2''. It can also sound very thoughtful or sad when playing in its lowest register. A good example is the opening of Claude Debussy ''Prélude à l'après midi d'un faune also flutes Andre a brass instrument and can make a really low pitch. ==Playing== File:Mariane-bitran.jpg The flute is a woodwind instrument, but modern flutes are made of metal. It was made of wood a long time ago. It doesn't need lip vibration like brass instruments. Flute players hold it horizontally and make a sound by blowing their breath over the edge of the hole of flute's head. This makes the air vibrate. Flutes need the second most amount of air for an instrument, next to the tuba. Flautists can change the pitch by pushing buttons or changing the direction of the breath. These buttons are called keys. The breath also can change the tone or the volume. Flute has many variations of the sound. The sound of flute is high, so composers often express it as a bird. A flute matches with many instruments such as violin and piano, and is often part of an ensemble. ==Material== There are many kinds of flute, so the material also varies. Most flutes are made out of silver. Gold, platinum, wood, and aluminum are also used. The price of flute depends on the material, but there are many different playing situations, so not only expensive flutes are useful. ==Different Flutes== === Flutes of India and China === The oldest kind of side-blown flute was made in India. In India, a flute called bansuri is used. It has no keys and is often made of bamboo or cane.

The Chinese flute sometimes has a thin piece of paper over one hole, which adds a bright raspiness to the sound. === Other flutes === There are other kinds of flute, that are played by blowing into the end, like a recorder. Some of these are tin whistle, flageolet, tabor pipe, and ocarina, and slide whistle. In Japan there is a kind of flute called a ''shakuhachi'', which is made from the bottom of a bamboo plant. It is blown at the end, but is not like the recorder because it does not have an opening that guides the air across a hole that makes the sound. In South America, there is a flute called a ''quena'' that makes its sound the same way as the ''shakuhachi''. The Pan flute are a form of flute with no holes. It has more than one pipe connected together, with the bottom closed. The player blows across the top of one of the pipes to make a note. The pipes are in different sizes, so that each one makes a different note. They are named after Pan (mythology), who played this instrument in Ancient Greece myth. ==Gallery== There are flutes in many cultures. The flute has been described as "a musical weed which springs up everywhere".
