He was part of the Capetian dynasty and the first king of the House of Bourbon in France. ==Life== Henry IV was born in Pau. He was the son of Antoine de Bourbon and Jeanne d'Albret. He was baptised in a Roman Catholic Church ceremony, but as he grew up, his mother led him to become a Protestantism. On 18 August 1572, Henry married Margaret of Valois. She was the sister of Charles IX of France. He became the King of Navarre the same year. Since 1562, there had been a French Wars of Religion that were fought mostly between Catholics and Protestants and sometimes with groups of Catholics fighting each other. In 1584, Henry became the heir to the throne of France. Most people in France were Catholics, and many of them did not want a Protestant king. That led to the War of the Three Henrys between Henry of Navarre, the existing Catholic King Henry III of France and theCatholic League (France) leader Henry I, Duke of Guise. Although both Henry III and Guise were Catholics, they opposed each other. Guise was murdered in 1588, and Henry III was murdered the following year. Henry of Navarre could now be crowned King of France, but he still faced opposition from the Catholic League. After four years of fighting, he decided to convert to being Catholic. Opposition to Henry then died down. In 1598, Henry made the Edict of Nantes, a law that allowed people in France to be Protestant even though most people were Catholic. In Europe, such a policy was unusual since most countries forced people to be either Catholic or Protestant. However, the edict did not make the Protestants fully equal. Henry's children were Louis XIII of France and Henrietta Maria of France, who married Charles I of England and became the Queen of England. He was a friend of the essayist Michel of Montaigne. During his reign, Henry built the Grande Galerie onto the Louvre. Two landmarks in Paris were started during his reign: the Pont Neuf and the Place des Vosges. Henry was murdered by a Catholic fanatic on a street in Paris on 14 May 1610. == Reputation == At first, many people in France did not want Henry to be king, because he was a Protestant. Although that mostly ended once he became Catholic, some Catholics thought that he had not converted sincerely, and some Protestants called him a traitor. It was only after his death that he became known as ''Good King Henry'' (in French, ''le bon roi Henri'') and one of France's most popular kings. During the early years of the French Revolution, Henry was celebrated as an example of what a king should be. He was also celebrated during the Bourbon Restoration in France. Henry is remembered for being the king who ended the French Wars of Religion and for his policy of allowing more than one church in his country, which was unusual at the time. He was also known for trying to make sure that poor people had enough to eat. He once said he wished that there could be "a chicken in every pot on a Sunday." In 2010 scientists found part of his embalmed head and used forensic tests to prove that it was his. It had been stolen from the tombs of the French kings and queens in Saint-Denis in 1793, during the French Revolution."Found at last: 400-year-old head of Henri IV; The Independent 16 December 2010 p.21 ==Children== {| class="wikitable" |- !Name!!Birth!!Death!!Notes |- |Louis XIII of France||27 September 1601||14 May 1643||Married Anne of Austria in 1615. |- |Elisabeth of France||22 November 1602||6 October 1644||Married Philip IV of Spain in 1615. |- |Christine Marie of France||12 February 1606||27 December 1663||Married Victor Amadeus I of Savoy in 1619. |- |Nicholas Henri of France, Duc d'Orléans||16 April 1607||17 November 1611||. |- |Gaston, Duke of Orléans||25 April 1608||2 February 1660||Married (1) Marie de Bourbon in 1626.Married (2) Marguerite of Lorraine in 1632. |- |Henrietta Maria||25 November 1609||10 September 1669||Married Charles I of England in 1625. |- |} ==References== Category:1553 births Category:1610 deaths Category:Kings of France Category:House of Bourbon Category:French Roman Catholics Category:People with foods named after them Category:Princes of Andorra Category:Navarrese monarchs Category:People from Pau, France
