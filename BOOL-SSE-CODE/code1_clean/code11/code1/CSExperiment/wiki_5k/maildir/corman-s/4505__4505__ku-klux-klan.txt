Canada Charleston, South Carolina}} The '''Ku Klux Klan (KKK)''' is an United States White supremacy hate group. A group of Confederate States of America Veteran created the original KKK in Pulaski, Tennessee on December 24, 1865. This was shortly after the Confederacy lost the American Civil War. The group quickly expanded among White people in the southern United States. There have been several versions of the Ku Klux Klan. The original Klan lasted till 1871, when the group was made illegal. In 1915 an Atlanta businessman named William J. Simmons started the Ku Klux Klan for a second time. The third KKK emerged in the 1950s and 1960s in response to the Civil Rights Movement. The KKK's power and membership have greatly declined in recent years. In 2023 there were just 10 active Klan groups in the United States. ==Goals== The KKK's goal is to maintain 'white power' over Minority group. Most of their hatred is, and has always been, directed at African Americans. However, the KKK has also attacked Catholics, Jews and Immigration. It is a violent organization and was frequently involved with Lynching in the United States. ==Early years== A group of Confederate States of America Veteran, led by Nathan Bedford Forrest, created the original Ku Klux Klan shortly after the American Civil War ended, during Reconstruction of the United States. It began as a social club for former Confederate soldiers, who had fought to defend Slavery in the United States. The Klan quickly became a Terrorism. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center:[The first] Ku Klux Klan [was] a Vigilantism group mobilizing a campaign of violence and Terrorism against the African American people that benefited from the progress of Reconstruction. As the group gained members from all strata of Southern white society, it used violent intimidation to prevent Black Americans – and any white people who supported Reconstruction – from voting and holding Politician.File:Kkk1928.jpg in 1928.]] File:The Union as It Was.jpg File:Ku Klux Klan members and a burning cross, Denver, Colorado, 1921.jpg When the KKK started, northern soldiers were occupying the former Confederate States of America. Klan members feared that white people in the South could lose their White supremacy over black people. The Klan used violence and intimidation towards black voters to prevent them from voting. At times, United States Republican Party were also attacked by the Klan. The Klan used threats and violence to terrorize black people. When they wanted a person to leave town, they would Cross burning or threaten violence in order to scare them away. If the person did not leave, the Klan would kill them. Increasingly, the Klan used and promoted violence. Klan members participated in lynching many black men. The growing violence promoted by the KKK led to many Lynching in the United States (Extrajudicial killing, often by hanging). In 1871, the group was outlawed. Many KKK members were put in prison. Still, the group continued its efforts to maintain white supremacy. It disbanded after the Jim Crow laws enforced Racial segregation, achieving the Klan's goal to maintain white supremacy. By the time it disbanded, the original Ku Klux Klan had achieved many of its original goals. For instance, the United States government moved the troops occupying the Southern states into the West. The KKK also successfully prevented many black people from voting through violence, intimidation, and the threat of lynchings. ==The second Ku Klux Klan== In 1915, William J. Simmons, an Atlanta businessman, re-started the Ku Klux Klan. A movie called ''The Birth of a Nation'' had just been released. It portrayed African-American men (played by White people actors in blackface) as stupid and Sexual assault towards white women. It also showed the Ku Klux Klan as a heroic force. The movie proved to be an excellent recruitment tool for the KKK. The new KKK kept most of the original group's Ritual and traditions. Any white Protestantism man could join. This version of the Klan attacked not just African Americans but also Jew, Catholic Church, and Southern Europe and Eastern Europe Immigration (like Italian Americans, Russian Americans, and Lithuanian Americans), many of whom were Jewish or Catholic. In 1920, the Klan began attracting recruits from all over the nation. They wikt:promised better law enforcement, better government, better schools, and a return to traditional family values. The KKK's views were based on White supremacy: the belief that white people are superior to other Race (sociology) groups and ought to rule them. There were a number of Scandal within the second KKK, a great deal of internal Feud, and unhappiness among Klan members who were tiring of the group's violent image. ===Statistics=== The second KKK reached the height of its influence in the 1920s, with about 5 million members. However, the group's influence and membership declined quickly. By the 1930s there were just 30,000 Klan members in the country. The group was Prosecutor for failure to pay Income tax in the United States and disbanded in 1944. In 86 years, the KKK killed an estimated 3,446 black people. Most of these murders were Extrajudicial killing hangings where the victim had received no trial. These were acts of terrorism because the KKK used fear to control African Americans and take away their political rights.

Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas'', one of the most important court cases in American history.
