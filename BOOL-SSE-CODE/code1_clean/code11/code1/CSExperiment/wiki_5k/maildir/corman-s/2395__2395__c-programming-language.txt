Subject: C (programming language)
File:The C Programming Language logo.svg The '''C programming language''' is a computer programming language developed in the early 1970s by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. They used it to improve the UNIX operating system. It is still much used today. C is a procedural language, which means that people write their computer program as a series of step-by-step instructions. C is a compiled language, which means that the computer source code, written in C, is converted to make machine code that a computer chip can actually execute. Because the ideas behind C are like the ideas used in the design of the computer, the compiler (program builder) can generate fast machine code for the computer. The language itself has very few Keyword (computer), and most things are done using programming library, which are collections of code made to be reused. C has a big standard library called stdio, which stands for standard input/output. C has a variety of uses: * writing embedded systems like the code that runs inside a computer mouse, or a car headlight. * writing device drivers like the code inside a laptop computer that interacts with the touchpad or the microphone. * writing protocol stacks like the code that allows one computer to communicate with other computers on the internet. * writing operating systems, such as the Linux kernel, MacOS and UNIX, and the utilities that come with those operating systems. * writing application software, such as web browsers, word processors, etc. * writing video games. Many of the most well-reviewed video games, including ''Doom (1993 video game)'', ''Quake (video game)'', and ''Super Mario 64'' are written in C. * The compilers and interpreters of many other programming languages, such as Python (programming language) and Perl, are written in C. ==C standards== The C language is over 50 years old, and has changed since it was first created. Every few years, people agree on the new parts of the C language they think would be good, and also remove some of the less-used parts. The agreed-upon language is declared as a standard, e.g. ''ANSI C, ISO C'' and ''Standard C'' which are published by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). C is available for many different types of computers. This is why C is called a portable language. A program that is written in C and that respects certain limitations can be compiled for many different platforms. The C language has also influenced many other programming languages, such as C++, C Sharp (programming language), and Java (programming language), and many more programming languages we use nowadays. ==Example code== Here is an example of a program written in C. When built and run it will show Hello World program, followed by a new line on the Computer monitor. #include int main(){ puts("Hello world!"); return 0; } * #include gets the standard input/output tools ready for the program to use. This allows text to be displayed (output). * int main() is called the main function, and it is where the first code starts being run in a C program. * puts("Hello world!"); is what displays text, in this case, "Hello world!". * return 0; tells the computer that the program finished and did not run into problems. ==Related pages== * C dynamic memory allocation * C++ * C Sharp (programming language) * Objective-C ==Other websites== * [http://overiq.com/c-programming-beginners/ Introduction to C programming] * [http://code-reference.com/c Coding Programmer Page / C Library Reference and Examples] (English) * [http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/C_(programming_language) C (programming language)] -Citizendium Category:Programming languages
