A '''welfare state''' is where the government has a duty to provide some level of basic support for welfare of its citizens, including Social Security. In politics, conservatives are against welfare states. == Examples == The government provides scholarship to people who do not have as much as most other people in terms of education. The state may also give homes to people who do not have them particularly who find it difficult to make ends meet due to lack of education. The state has a system in place to monitor the progress of above such aids. To make this happen there have to be economical reformation, and the state and organisations who believe that the future is now come together to achieve this. The state also will aid in tax audits initially to put such a measure in place. The taxes vary and the pyramid information will be available for such a complex socio-political structure. A Welfare State could also be paid for if the government borrows money from people, mainly by selling bonds. It is run by the government which helps the poor and the needy out. Scholarship scheme at varying levels would be introduced to the school and university pupils so a healthy yet connected growth of youth happens. Thus a seamless transition happens in a way the future generations stand as self sustaining individuals and contribute back to the state welfare through sense of giving back and also giving forward to their next generation.
