The club is nicknamed ''The Pilgrims''. The team usually plays in green, white and black. ==History== ===Formation and early years (1886–1937)=== File:Plymouth Argyle 1903-04 Team Photo.jpg The club was founded in 1886 as Argyle Football Club, the first match taking place on 16 October 1886 against Caxton, a team from Cornwall and in which the Pilgrims lost 2–0. Later that week Argyle won for the first time, beating Dunheved College (now Launceston College) in Launceston, Cornwall (where many of the club's first members had been educated) 2–1. The club played several friendlies against Plymouth United F.C., but poor performances on the pitch led to it going out of existence in 1894 before being resurrected in 1897 as one part of a general sports club, the '''Argyle Athletic Club'''. In 1898, Argyle F.C. produced its first rulebook. The club's ground was given as Marsh Mills, an area on the edge of the city of Plymouth. Much speculation surrounds the origin of the name ''Argyle''. One explanation is that the club was named after the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, an army regiment with a strong football side of its own. Another theory is given by the local geography–suggesting the name comes either from the nearby public house, ''The Argyle Tavern'', where the founder members may have met, or from a local street ''Argyle Terrace''. The club adopted its current name when it became fully professional in 1903, joining the Southern Football League, under the management of Bob Jack. Argyle's first professional game was on 1 September 1903 against West Ham United F.C. resulting in a 2–0 win for Argyle. The first home game as a fully professional club was on 5 September 1903 when Argyle beat Northampton Town F.C. 2–0 in front of a crowd of 4,438. Argyle won the Southern Football League in 1913, then in 1920 entered the Football League Third Division as a founder member, finishing 11th in its first season. File:PlymouthArgyleFC League Performance.svg In the summer of 1924, a Plymouth Argyle team visited South America to play some exhibition football in Argentina and Uruguay. Argyle thrashed Uruguay national football team 4–0 in the first game (the team which went on to win the 1930 FIFA World Cup just six years later), before pulling off another shock by beating Argentina national football team 1–0.

Moses Russell captained the side and played in all nine matches. Russell's style of play caught the attention of the Argentine press; at the end of the tour 'The Standard of Buenos Aires' commented: "The visit of Plymouth Argyle will be best remembered by the outstanding personality and genius of Moses Russell. His effective style, precise judgement, accurate and timely clearances, powerful kicking and no less useful work with his head...one of the most wonderful backs and one of the brainiest players ever seen on the football field." File:Plymouth argyle 1924.jpg In the match against Boca Juniors on 9 July 1924, the Boca Juniors supporters invaded the pitch after their team had scored the opening goal and carried all eleven home players shoulder high around the stadium. After a half-hour delay, the referee restarted the match, but a further invasion was sparked when the referee awarded a penalty against the home side. When the match was again restarted, the Argyle players had agreed that Patsy Corcoran would take the spot-kick and miss, to prevent another pitch invasion. However, the ultra-competitive Russell was not prepared to accept this, and just before Corcoran was about to take the penalty he was pushed aside by Russell, who took it himself and scored. This prompted a further pitch invasion by the Boca fans and this time the match was abandoned.[http://www.greensonscreen.co.uk/argylehistory.asp?era=1920-1930 Chapter 13: 1920–1930] by Colin Parsons on Green on Screen website File:Plymouth argyle v argentina 1924.jpg in 1924]] Back in England, uniquely, between 1921–22 and 1926–27, Argyle finished second in the Football League Third Division South six seasons in a row, thereby missing promotion. Argyle eventually won promotion to Football League Division Two in 1929–30, when the club topped the Third Division South, with attendances that season regularly reaching 20,000. Manager Bob Jack resigned in 1937, having spent 27 years in charge of the Pilgrims. Eleven years earlier in 1928, David Jack (footballer), who began his career with Argyle in 1919 but left in 1920, joined Arsenal F.C. from Bolton Wanderers for a fee of £10,890 – which made him the most expensive player in the world at the time. He was also the first player to score at Wembley Stadium (1923). ===1937–1986=== After the World War II Argyle's 20-year stay in Division Two came to an end in 1950–despite the efforts of inspirational captain Jack Chisholm. However, the club was back in Division Two before long, after winning the Third Division South in 1952. The closest the club has ever come to playing in the Football League First Division (top tier) was in 1952–53 Football League, when reaching fourth place in the Football League Second Division, the highest finish to date. In the 1954–55 Football League season Floodlights (sport) arrived at Home Park, but in 1956 Argyle went down again. The Pilgrims' reputation as a 'yo-yo club' continued after winning Division Three–by now a national league–in 1959. File:Jack Rowley.jpg managed the club for over 230 games between 1955 and 1960, and won the Football League Third Division with the club in 1959]] The 1960s started with one of the most bizarre events in Argyle's history. It came in the spring of 1963, when the club went on a mini-tour of Poland—the Pilgrims were invited to play a game as a warm-up to an international cycle race. Amazingly, 100,000 saw Argyle that day—the biggest crowd ever to attend a Plymouth match. In 1965 Argyle reached the Football League Cup semi-final, as a 2nd division team, for the first time in its history, but lost to Leicester City. But the decade ended disappointingly as Argyle returned to Division Three after relegation in 1968. In March 1973 a memorable moment in Argyle's history was witnessed by 37,639 people at Home Park. Argyle played a friendly match against Brazilian giants Santos FC, who at the time were one of the best teams in the world. That day Santos also had arguably the best footballer of all time in their starting line-up –Pelé. However, Argyle, then a Third Division side, shocked the world with a 3–2 win. The Greens were actually 3–0 up at one stage (thanks to goals from Mike Dowling, Derek Rickard and Jimmy Hinch) but a Penalty kick (association football) scored at the Barn Park End by Pelé helped a Santos fightback. However, in the end Santos came up short and were defeated. There was a huge pitch invasion at the final whistle after a win for The Pilgrims. In 1974 – with future England striker and Argyle manager Paul Mariner now playing for the team – Argyle again reached the League Cup semi-final, this time as a Third Division side. Argyle drew the first leg at home against Manchester City F.C. 1–1, but lost the Maine Road encounter 2–0. After spending six years in Division Three, Argyle finally returned to Division Two in 1974–75, under the management of Tony Waiters.

However, the club was back down again in 1977. Although the decade did end on a high note–in 1978–79 Kevin Hodges made his Argyle debut, and he went on to play 620 games for the club–more than any other player. File:Home Park, Plymouth - geograph.org.uk - 1229431.jpg in 1981|left]] In 1984 Plymouth reached the FA Cup semi-final despite being in the Third Division. After a successful cup run in which Argyle beat West Bromwich Albion F.C. away, a top division team at the time (1–0 courtesy of a Tommy Tynan goal after 58 minutes), and Derby County F.C. (the first game at Home Park ended 0–0, but Argyle won the replay 0–1 at the Baseball Ground), they lost 1–0 to Watford F.C. in the semi-final at Villa Park courtesy of a George Reilly goal. However, manager John Hore (footballer, born 1947) was sacked during the following campaign and was replaced by Dave Smith (footballer born 1933). Plymouth Argyle - PAFC |url=https://www.pafc.co.uk/news/dave-smith-1933-2022 |access-date=2023-05-05 |website=www.pafc.co.uk |language=en |archive-date=14 September 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220914004051/https://www.pafc.co.uk/news/dave-smith-1933-2022 |url-status=live }} In 1985–86, Smith's first full season in charge, Argyle finished as runners-up in Division Three, resulting in promotion. The following season, despite being a newly promoted team, Argyle finished a respectable 7th place in Division Two, thereby narrowly missing the division's new play-off zone and the chance to move to the First Division (now the Premier League). In 1988 Smith surprisingly left to take charge of Dundee F.C., making way for Ken Brown (footballer born 1934) to become manager.

Plymouth Argyle - PAFC |url=https://www.pafc.co.uk/news/2020/march/dan-mccauley-rip |access-date=2023-05-05 |website=www.pafc.co.uk |language=en |archive-date=5 May 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230505073150/https://www.pafc.co.uk/news/2020/march/dan-mccauley-rip |url-status=live }} But Shilton was unable to prevent relegation as Argyle finished 22nd in Division Two. Ahead of the 1992–93 season, English football had a revamp. The First Division (top tier) became the Premiership, Division Two (second tier) became Division One, Division Three (third tier) was now Division Two and so on. As a result, Argyle was still in Division Two, but it was now the third tier instead of the second. In 1992–93 Argyle finished in mid-table in the third tier, but Peter Shilton's side finished third the following campaign (as a result of playing some excellent football), thereby qualifying for the play-offs. But Argyle lost in the semi-final against Burnley F.C., which saw the start of a fierce rivalry between the two clubs. The Pilgrims suffered even more disappointment in 1994–95 as Shilton parted company with the club, which was eventually relegated to Division Three (fourth tier) for the first time in its history. Player Steve McCall became the club's manager on a short-term deal after Shilton's departure, but at the end of the season his contract was not renewed and Neil Warnock stepped in as his successor. Plymouth Argyle - PAFC |url=https://www.pafc.co.uk/news/neil-warnock-are-you-me-live-home-park-stadium |access-date=2023-05-05 |website=www.pafc.co.uk |language=en |archive-date=5 May 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230505073156/https://www.pafc.co.uk/news/neil-warnock-are-you-me-live-home-park-stadium |url-status=live }} At the end of the 1995–96 in English football season, Warnock took Plymouth to Division Three play-off glory in his first campaign as manager. The semi-final was a memorable affair. Argyle played Colchester United and although 1–0 down from the 1st leg, won 3–1 at Home Park in the 2nd, meaning that the Pilgrims were going to Wembley Stadium (1923) for the first time in their history. Pilgrims Win at Wembley 96 Plymouth Argyle - PAFC |url=https://www.pafc.co.uk/news/argyle-archive-pilgrims-win-wembley-96 |access-date=2023-05-05 |website=www.pafc.co.uk |language=en |archive-date=5 May 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230505073136/https://www.pafc.co.uk/news/argyle-archive-pilgrims-win-wembley-96 |url-status=live }} Argyle beat Darlington 1–0 in the play-off final to gain third-tier football once more. File:Home Park 1996.jpg But Warnock was sacked within a year as the club narrowly avoided being relegated back to the fourth tier. Mick Jones (footballer, born 1947) became his successor, and, that season, in February 1997 Argyle participated in 'The Battle of Saltergate' – in a 1–2 win at Chesterfield F.C.. The following season Argyle went down under Jones, and his successor Kevin Hodges (the club's record appearance holder) lasted three years before a failure to attain promotion (or even a play-off place) cost him his job. At this point Argyle was in danger of insolvency, and it was the lowest point in its history. The appointment of Paul Sturrock as manager in November 2000 marked a turning point in Argyle's history. He saved the club from relegation out of the Football League (the club was fourth from bottom of the league when he became manager), and finished 12th in his first season. The following campaign proved to be the most successful in the club's history. Argyle defeated Cheltenham Town F.C. 2–0 in the final game of the season to achieve a club and league record of 102 points and clinch the Division Three title. Argyle was one of the favourites to win the Division Two title going into the 2003–04 season, and proved everyone right as the club earned its second promotion in three years. In March 2004 Bobby Williamson was appointed manager. Argyle's first game in the newly re-branded 'Championship' (second tier) saw them draw 0–0 at home to Millwall F.C., who were FA Cup finalists the season before. Argyle's strong start continued, and the club briefly reached the top of the table – its highest ever position – after a 0–1 win at Cardiff City F.C., before plummeting down the table and finishing 17th. The 2005–06 season included some memorable results for the Green Army including the 2–0 win against high-flying Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. and a 0–0 draw at Leeds United, who went on to reach the play-off final at the Millennium Stadium before losing 3–0 to Watford F.C.. The Pilgrims finished 14th that season, in the end well clear of the relegation zone. In summer 2006, in one of Ian Holloway's first games in charge of the club, Argyle played a pre-season friendly against Real Madrid C.F. in Austria, as both clubs were training in the country at the time. Holloway's first competitive game in charge was a 1–1 draw at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. The team made significantly better progress than in recent seasons in the FA Cup, reaching the quarter-finals. They beat League Two Peterborough United F.C.. They beat Championship league leaders Derby County F.C. 2–0 in the next, but in the quarter finals, faced Premier League strugglers Watford at home and lost. Argyle finished the 2006–07 in 11th place, the highest league finish for 20 years. Before the start of the 2007–08 season, manager Ian Holloway said that Plymouth was capable of earning promotion to the Premier League for the first time in its history, and the team made a good start to the new season with a 2–3 win at Hull City A.F.C.. The club's good start continued as they stayed near the play-off places for the first few months. However, on 21 November 2007 Ian Holloway controversially resigned to take charge of Leicester City F.C.. ===Decline and financial issues (2008–2018)=== File:Plymouth Argyle Football Club - panoramio.jpgThe club finished 2008 in 15th place–now 8 points adrift of the play-offs. On 3 January 2009, Argyle travelled to the recently built Emirates Stadium to play against Premier League giants Arsenal F.C. in the FA Cup third round. Striker Robin Van Persie scored his second of the game five minutes from time to give Arsenal a 3–1 win. The club finished 21st in the league table, five points and one place clear of the relegation places–Argyle's first season which didn't improve its league position for eight years. Paul Sturrock's second stint in charge came to an end on 10 December 2009, when a press conference confirmed he was relieved of his managerial duties due to two years of poor results and fan unrest. However, Mariner lost his first two games–his first fixture resulted in a 2–0 loss at Preston North End F.C. and then Argyle was defeated 1–0 at home to Coventry, leaving the Pilgrims bottom of the table and six points adrift of safety. Argyle ended the season as the second lowest-scoring team in the division. The club's six-year stay in the second tier of the Football League was over. On 20 November, following a 1–2 home defeat to Brentford F.C., newly relegated Argyle was 20th in League One, just one place and three points above the relegation zone. On 23 November, Argyle came from 0–1 down to beat fellow strugglers Dagenham & Redbridge F.C. 2–1 at Home Park, lifting them up to 15th. However, just 4,960 were present at the game. That was Argyle's lowest league attendance since playing in the bottom tier. Not long after, the Pilgrims were presented with a winding-up order by HMRC and appeared in court on 8 December, only to earn a 63-day adjournment so they could pay the taxes they owed. Relegation was later confirmed on 2 May, following a 3–1 home defeat against Southampton F.C..[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/13184984.stm "Plymouth 1 – 3 Southampton"] . BBC Sport. 2 May 2011. Retrieved 2 May 2011. File:Homepark2.png James Brent's Akkeron Group agreed to a deal with the Administrators to buy the club with Peter Ridsdale also confirming that he would leave the club when the deal had been completed.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/15100530.stm "Administrators agree Plymouth Argyle sale"][http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/15035687.stm "Peter Ridsdale to leave Plymouth Argyle"] Further problems occurred with the Administrators threatening to quit the club.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/15314429.stm "Plymouth Argyle administrators threaten to quit"] Argyle agreed to a deal to sell Home Park back to Plymouth council on 14 October for £1.6m and had to pay £135,000 a year in rent. The team's form greatly improved after the takeover, and while the eventual League finish of 21st was the lowest in the club's history, the club still secured survival with three games to spare, which was quite an achievement considering it had been well adrift at the bottom for the first half of the campaign. In the following season, the club was again narrowly saved from relegation, and finished 21st for a consecutive season. Sheridan then agreed a three-year contract to continue as Argyle manager, and in his first full season in charge, the club finished 10th. Argyle had a far stronger start to its fourth consecutive season in League 2, winning 4 games consecutively for the first time since 2008. The team had the chance to go up as champions. But the title was handed to Portsmouth F.C. via goal difference. The Pilgrims got off to an appalling start to their 2017-18 EFL League One campaign, gaining only 5 points in their first 11 games and sitting rock bottom, already 4 points from safety after only 11 games. And a 2–1 defeat at home to Fleetwood Town F.C. added to Argyle's woes, extending the winless run to 10 games and earning just 2 points from a possible 30 in that time. Some fans disputed the board sacking Derek Adams even after taking them up in the previous season, due to poor tactics and game management. From December 2017, through 2018 saw Argyle record 16 wins, 6 draws and only 5 losses to escape relegation and finish 7th, only missing out on a play-off spot by 3 points. ===Hallett takes over (2018–present)=== In August 2018, Hallett became the majority shareholder of the club, with James Brent reducing his stake, as well as stepping down as chairman. Hallett had originally appointed David Felwick as Argyle's chairman-elect, but he cited "''personal reasons''" for being unable to takeover, so Hallett took over as chairman on 1 November 2018. At the end of the 2018–19 Plymouth Argyle F.C. season, Argyle was relegated to EFL League Two. File:CharltonArgyle201121 (8 of 8).jpg in 2021]] Ahead of the 2019–20 Plymouth Argyle F.C. season, Hallett appointed Ryan Lowe as Derek Adams's successor, signing the then 40-year-old Liverpudlian and his assistant manager Steven Schumacher from Bury F.C.. The change in management was a success as that season, Argyle finished in third place, gaining promotion back to EFL League One. Albeit, the next season the team struggled to find their footing in the third tier, and finished 18th on 53 points. The following season was an improvement, and in December 2021 Ryan Lowe was replaced by his assistant, Steven Schumacher leading the club into 7th place for the 2021–22 Plymouth Argyle F.C. season season. Argyle enjoyed its best season since 2007–08 Plymouth Argyle F.C. season in 2022–23 Plymouth Argyle F.C. season, with the new Mayflower stand fully built, the capacity of Home Park rose to 17,900, and the club regularly saw 16,000 fans turning up to support the team. The club won the EFL League One title, clinching it in an away win at Port Vale F.C., and finishing the season on 101 points. In their first season back in the second tier in thirteen years, Plymouth finished in 21st position, avoiding relegation on the final day of the season. In the 2024–25 FA Cup, Plymouth defeated Premier League leaders Liverpool F.C. 1–0 at Home Park in the fourth round of the FA Cup. == Club information == The club is called ''The Pilgrims'' because the people that left Plymouth, England for The Americas were the first people to be called Pilgrims. The ship on the badge is called Mayflower (ship). The first pilgrims travelled on the Mayflower. The club's stadium is called Home Park. It was ruined by Germany aeroplanes in World War II. Home Park was repaired after the war. In 2001 and 2002, Home Park was made into a better stadium. Some parts of the stadium were not used while the work was being done. The stadium is now fully open. The club was made in 1886, but it was called Argyle Athletic Club. The club changed its name to Plymouth Argyle Football Club in 1903. Plymouth Argyle has never won a match by more than 7 goals. They have beaten Hartlepool United F.C. and Millwall F.C. 8-1. On 3 January 2004, they beat Chesterfield F.C. 7-0. The club lost 9-0 to Stoke City F.C. in 1960. Luke McCormick is a goalkeeper. He played seven games in a row for Plymouth Argyle without letting the other teams score a single goal. In the 1990s, Peter Shilton, Neil Warnock, and John Gregory all managed the club. The club won Division Three in 2001/02, won Division Two in 2003/04 and now plays in the newly named Championship, the second tier of English football. When the club won Division Three they scored 102 points. No other team had ever scored that many points. == Name == * 1886–1903: '''Argyle Athletic Football Club''' * 1903–Present: '''Plymouth Argyle Football Club''' == 100th season == 2003/04 is the club`s 100th season since becoming Plymouth Argyle in 1903.
