Celtic Gauls inhabited Ancient Gaul. Julius Caesar conquered Gaul for Roman Empire in the 1st century BC. Eventually, the Gauls adopted Romance languages speech (Latin, from which the French language evolved) and Roman culture. History of Christianity first appeared in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD. It became firmly established by the fourth and fifth centuries. File:Map France 1477-fr.svg === Franks === In the 4th century AD, the Germanic peoples, principally the Franks invaded the Gauls. This is how the name ''Francie'' appeared. The modern name "France" comes from the name of the Capetian dynasty Kings of France around Paris. The Franks were the first tribe of Europe after the fall of the Roman Empire to convert to Christianity rather than Arianism. The French called themselves "the most Christian Kingdom of France". The Treaty of Verdun (843), divided Charlemagne's Empire into three parts. The biggest area was Western Francia. It is similar to modern France. === Kingdom === ==== Middle Ages ==== The Carolingian dynasty ruled France until 987, when Hugh Capet of France became King of France. His descendants, the Capetian dynasty, the House of Valois and the House of Bourbon, wikt:unify the country with many wars and dynastic inheritance. One of the most famous kings, Louis XIV, ruled from 1643 to 1715. He ruled the longest in history. ==== Enlightenment ==== The monarchy was the most great powerful during the 17th century and the reign of Louis XIV of France. At that time, France had the Demographics of France. The country had a big influence over European politics, economy, and culture. French became the common language of diplomacy in international affairs. Much of the Age of Enlightenment happened in France. French scientists made big Science discoveries in the 18th century. France also invasion many French overseas collectivities in the Americas and Asia. === Republic === ==== Napoleonic Wars ==== France had a monarchy until the French Revolution in 1789. King Louis XVI of France and his wife, Marie Antoinette, were executed in 1793, by Maximilien Robespierre. Thousands of other French citizens were killed. Napoleon Bonaparte took control of the Republic in 1799. He later made himself Emperor of the First Empire (1804–1814). His armies conquered most of continental Europe. The metric system was invented by French scientists during the French revolution. That time 3 estates were developed. After Napoleon's final defeat in 1815 at the Battle of Waterloo, another monarchy arose. An interesting fact is that the French King Louis XIX was king for only 20 minutes from the time his father Charles X abdicated, to the time the July Monarchy started in 1830. Later Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte created the Second Empire in 1852. Louis-Napoléon was removed after the defeat in the Franco-Prussian war of 1870. The Third Republic replaced his regime. ==== Colonialism ==== The large French colonial empire in the 19th century included parts of West Africa and Southeast Asia. The culture and politics of these regions were influenced by France. Many colony officially speak the French language. ==== World Wars ==== The country actively took part in both the WWI and WWII, with battles taking place on its soil. During the First World War, millions were killed in the Trench warfare including over a million in the Battle of the Somme. The conditions were extremely difficult for the soldiers on the front.

They are like the overseas American states of Alaska and Hawaii. Then France is divided into 101 Departments of France. The departments are divided into 342 Arrondissements of France. The ''arrondissements'' are re-divided into 4,032 Cantons of France. The smallest Administrative division is the Communes of France (there are 36,699 communes).

About 10% of France's defence budget is for its nuclear weapons force. == Economy == File:A380 Reveal 2.jpg in Toulouse on 18 January 2005. Airbus is a symbol of the globalization of the French and European economy.]] France is a member of the G8 group of wikt:lead#Verb wikt:industry countries. France has the eighth-largest economy in the world by gross domestic product (which takes into account how much it costs to live in different countries and inflation rates).

The government has a considerable influence over railway, electricity, aircraft, and telecommunications firms (as it owns big companies like SNCF and Électricité de France (French electricity)). France has an important aerospace (design of aircraft and spacecraft) industry led by Airbus. It can also launch rockets from French Guiana. France has invested a lot in nuclear power. This made France the smallest producer of Greenhouse gas among the seven most industrialised countries in the world. As a result, 59 nuclear power plants generate most of the electricity produced in the country (78% in 2006, up from only 8% in 1973, 24% in 1980, and 75% in 1990). France is the leading agricultural producer and exporter in Europe. France exports wheat, poultry, dairy products, beef, and pork. It is also famous for its wine industry.

French was divided into several dialects at the time. Some authors spelling words differently from one other. During the 17th century, Pierre Corneille, Jean Racine, Molière, Blaise Pascal and René Descartes were the main authors. In the 18th and 19th centuries, French literature and poetry reached its best. The 18th century saw writings of authors, essayists and moralists as Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.

France also hosted the Winter Olympic Games three times: in 1924 in Chamonix, in 1968 in Grenoble, and in 1992 in Albertville. === Cuisine === File:Terrine de saumon au basilic.JPG]] French cuisine has influenced the style of cooking throughout Europe, and its chefs work in restaurants throughout the world. The roots of modern ''haute cuisine'' lie in chefs like François Pierre La Varenne (1615–1678) and the notable chef of Napoleon, Marie-Antoine Carême (1784–1833). These chefs developed a lighter style of food compared to the food of the Middle Ages. They used fewer spices, and more herbs and creamy ingredients. Typical ingredients like roux and fish stock, and techniques such as marinade, and dishes such as ragout, were invented. Carême was an expert pâtissier (pastry-maker), and this is still a mark of French cooking. He developed basic sauces, his 'mother sauces'; he had over a hundred sauces in his repertoire, based on the half-dozen mother sauces. French cuisine was introduced in the 20th century by Auguste Escoffier (1846–1935). He was a genius at organization. He worked out how to run large restaurants, as in a big hotel or a palace; how the staff should be organized; how the menu was prepared. He had methods for everything. Escoffier's largest contribution was the publication of ''Le Guide Culinaire'' in 1903, which established the fundamentals of French cookery. Escoffier managed the restaurants and cuisine at the Savoy Hotel and Carlton Hotel in London, the Hôtel Ritz Paris, and some of the greatest cruise ships. Escoffier, however, left out much of the culinary character to be found in the regions of France. Gastro-tourism and the ''Guide Michelin'' helped to make people familiar with the rich bourgeois and peasant cuisine of the French countryside in the 20th century. Gascony cuisine has also had great influence over the cuisine in the southwest of France. Many dishes that were once regional have become common all over the country. Cheese and wine are a major part of the cuisine, playing different roles regionally and nationally. In the north of France, people often prefer to use butter to wikt:cook. In the south, they prefer olive oil and garlic. In France, each Regions of France has its own special dish; choucroute in Alsace, quiche in Lorraine, cassoulet in the Languedoc-Roussillon, and tapenade in Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur. In November 2010, French gastronomy was added by UNESCO to its lists of the world's 'intangible cultural heritage'.[http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/world/stories/DN-culture_17int.ART.State.Edition1.b21e71.html Bon appétit: Your meal is certified by the U.N.] Dallas Morning News File:Chateau-de-versailles-cour.jpg is one of the most popular tourist destinations in France.]] === Tourism === File:Paris 06 Eiffelturm 4828.jpg]] France is the number one tourist destination in the world.

In the 1960s, France wanted to exclude the United Kingdom from the organization. It wanted to build its own economic Influence in continental Europe. France and Germany became closer after World War II. This was to try to become the most influential country in the EU. It limited the influence of the new Eastern European members. France is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). However, under Charles de Gaulle, it left the joint military command. In the early 1990s, France received criticism for its underground nuclear weapons tests in French Polynesia. France vigorously opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
