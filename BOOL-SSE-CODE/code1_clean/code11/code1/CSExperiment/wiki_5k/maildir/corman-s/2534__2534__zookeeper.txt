Subject: Zookeeper
A '''zookeeper''' is a worker in a zoo, responsible for the feeding and daily care of the animals. As part of this, they clean the exhibits and report signs of bad health. They may also be involved in Research, and in public education, conducting tours or simply answering questions put by members of the public. Qualifications and pay of zookeepers both vary widely. A junior keeper in a small zoo may have no qualifications other than an affinity for the job, while a senior keeper in a large zoo would most probably have both a relevant academic degree and extensive experience. Generally, a liking for animals and outside work and willingness to undertake moderate and sometimes dirty physical work are required. Many animals are themselves heavy and strong-smelling, as is the food some of them eat. Handling such is part of the job at times. ==Other websites== *[http://www.bls.gov/k12/html/gym_004.htm Career information (USA)] Category:Occupations Category:Zoos
