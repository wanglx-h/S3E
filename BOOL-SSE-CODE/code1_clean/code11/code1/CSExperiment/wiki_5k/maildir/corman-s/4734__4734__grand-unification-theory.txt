Subject: Grand unification theory
'''Grand unification theory''' or '''GUT''' is a model(universe) that tries to describe the universe. It says that three Force (physics) - electromagnetism, weak interaction and strong interaction forces - were once combined into a single force. These are three of the fundamental four forces of nature, which are responsible for all of the pushes and pulls in the universe. If gravity is also combined with these forces, then the GUT will become the proposed Theory of Everything. Because GUT models have more Space dimensions than currently known, there has not been a single GUT. Particle accelerator, like the Large Hadron Collider have been built to test these GUTs indirectly, as it is too complex to observe effects on particles without them. GUT was first proposed by researchers from CERN in the 1970s. The discovery of the Higgs Boson and other such recent discoveries will get scientists closer to knowing which GUT is correct, and ultimately know the Theory of Everything. This theory was given by Pakistani scientist Abdus Salam, who shared the Noble Prize with Weinberg and Glashow for it in 1979. There have been numerous failed attempts to form a Grand Unified Theory, and many scientists believe that it is impossible¹. Although the attempts have not been successful so far, we have gained invaluable insight and understanding through the endeavours to find the Grand Unified Theory.
