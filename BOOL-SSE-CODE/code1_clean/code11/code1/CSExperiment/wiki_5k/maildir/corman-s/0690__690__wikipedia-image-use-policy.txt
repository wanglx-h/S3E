Subject: Wikipedia:Image use policy
This page contains the '''basic rules for using images''' on the Simple English Wikipedia. Unlike other Wikipedias, Simple English Wikipedia does not allow images to be uploaded directly to this project. All images used on Simple English Wikipedia should come from "Wikimedia Commons", which is a shared collection of free images. All of the images on the "Commons" web site are free of copyright and can be used anywhere in the world. This supports Simple English's goal of being an easy-to-read, easy-to-translate and free encyclopedia. ''':commons:Special:Search''' If you have images that you would like to put on Wikipedia, you can do that by uploading them to Wikimedia Commons – follow the instructions on '''commons:Commons:First steps'''. ==Exceptions== Images may be uploaded for a short time to illustrate improvements, bugs, and suggestions. They may not be used on articles/pages. There must be no copyright attached, a free license, and will be deleted soon after upload. Simple English Wikipedia logos may also be uploaded upon consensus being reached for a new project logo. == Using images on articles == To learn how to put images on pages, see '''Help:How to use images'''. # The best width for a picture is 250 pixels, and less than 150 pixels wide is too small. # Do not say who took a photo in an article. That information should be on the image description page only. # Use a good caption – a full sentence that describes the image is appropriate. ==Related pages== *Wikipedia:Manual of Style#Images *Wikipedia:Manual of Style#Captions ==Other websites== *[http://commons.wikimedia.org Wikimedia Commons website] Category:Wikipedia policies
