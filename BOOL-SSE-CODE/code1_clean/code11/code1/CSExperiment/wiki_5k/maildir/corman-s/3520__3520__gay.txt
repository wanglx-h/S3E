Today, the word usually means a person who is sexual attraction to people of the same sex. Often that person is also Romance (love) interested in people of the same sex. A gay person can be a male who likes other males or a female who likes other females. A person that is attracted to people only of the opposite sex is Heterosexuality. While a person attracted to people of the same sex and the opposite sex is Bisexuality. The word "gay" can mean any homosexual person, but sometimes it is used just for gay man. In that case, homosexual women are called "lesbian" instead. Sometimes, people use the word "queer" to mean the same thing as "gay" when talking about sexuality. In the early 20th century and before, "gay" used to mean 'happy' or 'carefree', but now people use it to define sexuality or to offend people. == Related pages == * Gay man * Lesbian == Other websites == * [http://www.ilga.org/ The International Lesbian and Gay Association] * [http://www.hrc.org/ The Human Rights Campaign] * [http://www.glaad.org/ The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation] Category:LGBT identities
