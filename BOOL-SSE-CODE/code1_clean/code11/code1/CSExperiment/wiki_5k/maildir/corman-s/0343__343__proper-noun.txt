Subject: Proper noun
A '''proper noun''' or '''proper name''' is a noun representing a wikt:unique thing (like ''London'', ''Jupiter'', ''John Hunter'', or ''Toyota''), unlike a '''common noun''', which represents a type of thing (like ''city'', ''planet'', ''person'' or ''corporation''). Proper nouns are the only nouns in English language which always have the first letter capitalized.OED vol II p1600 under "proper". "applied to a noun or name (written with an initial capital letter) describing a particular object or individual". In English, proper nouns don't usually come after an Article (grammar) or other limiting modifier (such as ''any'' or ''some''). They are used for a particular person, place, or object. For example, a town called "Newtown" may be, but does not necessarily have to be, a new [recently built] town). Which nouns are considered proper names depends on language. For example, names of days and months are considered proper names in English, but not in Spanish language, French language, Swedish language, Slovene language or Finnish language, where they are not capitalized. == References == Category:Parts of speech
