Image:KMines.png '''Minesweeper''' is a strategy game that comes with most Microsoft computer operating systems. It is available for many other operating systems and desktop environments as well. The object of the game is to clear a minefield of Land mine. By clicking on blocks, the player learns if the block contains a mine. If they do not see a mine, the game continues. If they clicked on a mine, the game is over. When the player clicks on a block, a number may appear. The number shows how many mines are next to this square. This helps the player find out where the mines are. The most common variation of the game is won when every block that does not contain a mine has been clicked, although some variations are won by having every block that contains a mine flagged. == Variations == There are many versions out there: Image:Minesweeper_games2relaxnet.png|Online, non rectangular Image:Cube_Minesweeper_3D.png|3D Image:Firefox_Hexagon_Minesweeper_-_fr.png|hexagonal Image:Xbomb_triangles.png|triangular Image:Freesweep.png|ASCII Image:Mines_Simon_Tatham's.png|no guess Image:Emoji_Minesweeper.png|emoji Category:Casual games Category:Linux games Category:Microsoft software Category:Puzzle video games Category:Video games about bomb disposal Category:Windows games
