An '''advisor''' (or '''adviser''') is someone who gives advice. (Someone who ''wikt:advises''.) The job of an advisor is to give good advice that helps the person that he or she is advising. Usually, only certain wikt:people, like businessman or politicians, have advisors. This is because these kinds of people are usually very wikt:busy, and they do not have the time to make decisions alone. In the United States, the President's advisors are called his "Cabinet."
