December 31 is followed by January 1 of the following year. December begins on the same day of the week as September every year, as each other's first days are exactly 13 weeks (91 days) apart. December ends on the same day of the week as April every year, as each other's last days are exactly 35 weeks (245 days) apart. In common years, December starts on the same day of the week as April and July of the previous year, and in leap years, October of the previous year. In common years, December finishes on the same day of the week as July of the previous year, and in leap years, February and October of the previous year. In leap years and years immediately after that, December both starts and finishes on the same day of the week as January of the previous year. In years immediately before common years, December starts on the same day of the week as June of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, March and November of the following year. In years immediately before common years, December finishes on the same day of the week as September of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, March and June of the following year. December is one of two months to have a solstice (the other is June, its seasonal equivalent in both hemispheres), and in this month the Tropic of Capricorn in the Southern Hemisphere is turned towards the Sun, meaning that December 21 or December 22 is the Northern Winter Solstice and the Southern Summer Solstice. This means that this date would have the least daylight of any day in the Northern Hemisphere, and the most in the Southern Hemisphere. There are 24 hours of darkness at the North Pole and 24 hours of daylight at the South Pole. In mainly Christian countries, December is dominated by Christmas, which is celebrated on December 25 in most of those countries, though Eastern Orthodox Christians celebrate it on January 7. It marks the birth of Jesus Christ. Epiphany (holiday), January 6, is also important in relation to Christmas. Advent starts on the Sunday on, or closest to, November 30, and some countries have their own related celebration before the 25th. Sinterklaas is celebrated on December 5 in the Netherlands and Belgium, and St. Nicholas Day on December 6 is also celebrated in some countries. The Scandinavian countries, mainly Sweden, celebrate St. Lucia Day on December 13, while Iceland celebrates Thorlaksmessa on December 23. The week after Christmas is spent preparing for New Year. Judaism's festival of light, Hanukkah, is also celebrated over eight days in this month. == Holidays and Festivals == === Fixed dates === File:WHredribbonNorthPortico.jpg, marking World AIDS Day, December 1.]] File:Sinterklaas 2007.jpg is celebrated in the Netherlands and Belgium on December 5.]] File:Lucia-13.12.06.jpg celebration in Sweden on December 13.]] File:Krippe Gutenzell.jpg Nativity scene]] File:Sydney new years 2008-9.JPG fireworks in Sydney, Australia, one of the first major cities to start the new year.]] File:EdinburghNYE.jpg in Scotland welcomes the new year with its famous Hogmanay fireworks]] * December 1 - World AIDS Day * December 1 - National Day of Romania * December 1 - Self-government Day (Iceland) * December 1 - Day of Restoration of Independence (Portugal) * December 1 - First Day of Summer (Australia) * December 2 - National Day of Laos * December 2 - National Day of the United Arab Emirates * December 2 - International Day for the Abolition of Slavery * December 4 - Navy Day in India and Italy * December 4 - Miners' Day (Poland) * December 4 - Tupou I Day (Tonga) * December 5 - Sinterklaas (Netherlands, Belgium) * December 5 - Birthday of King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand * December 6 - Saint Nicholas Day * December 6 - Independence Day (Finland) * December 6 - Constitution Day (Spain) * December 7 - Pearl Harbor Day (United States) * December 8 - Constitution Day in Romania and Uzbekistan * December 8 - Day of the Immaculate Conception (Roman Catholicism) * December 9 - National Day of Tanzania * December 10 - Nobel Prize Day * December 10 - Constitution Day (Thailand) * December 10 - Human Rights Day * December 11 - Republic Day (Burkina Faso) * December 11 - Indiana Day * December 11 - International Mountain Day * December 12 - Independence Day (Kenya) * December 12 - Our Lady of Guadalupe (Roman Catholicism) * December 13 - St. Lucia Day * December 14 - Alabama Day * December 15 - Homecoming Day (Alderney) * December 15 - Kingdom Day (Netherlands) * December 15 - Zamenhof Day (Esperanto supporters) * December 16 - Independence Day (Kazakhstan) * December 16 - Day of Reconciliation (South Africa) * December 16 - Victory Day in India and Bangladesh * December 17 - National Day of Bhutan * December 18 - National Day of Qatar * December 18 - New Jersey Day * December 18 - Republic Day (Niger) * December 18 - International Migrants Day * December 18 - United Nations Day of the Arabic language * December 21/December 22 - Northern Winter Solstice and Southern Summer Solstice * December 22 - Dongzhi Festival (East Asia) * December 22 - Mother's Day (Indonesia) * December 23 - Birthday of Emperor Akihito (Japan) * December 23 - Thorlaksmessa/St. Thorlak's Day (Iceland) * December 23 - HumanLight (Secular Humanism) * December 24 - Independence Day (Libya) * December 24 - Christmas Eve in Western Christianity * December 25 - Christmas Day in Western Christianity * December 25 - Birthday of Muhammad Ali Jinnah (Pakistan) * December 26 - Boxing Day (UK) * December 26 - St. Stephen's Day (Republic of Ireland) * December 26 - First Day of Kwanzaa * December 27 - Constitution Day (North Korea) * December 27 - St. Stephen's Day (Eastern Orthodox Church) * December 28 - Proclamation Day (South Australia) * December 28 - Day of the Holy Innocents, celebrated in Spanish language countries in a similar way to April Fools' Day * December 29 - Independence Day (Mongolia) * December 31 - New Year's Eve/ St. Silvester's Day - known as Hogmanay in Scotland and Calennig in Wales === Moveable and Non-Single Day Events === File:Chanukia.jpg in Judaism.]] * Hanukkah (Judaism) - celebrated over a period of eight days * Advent in Western Christianity **First Sunday in Advent occurs between November 27 and December 3 **Second Sunday in Advent occurs between December 4 and December 10 **Third Sunday in Advent occurs between December 11 and December 17 **Fourth and final Sunday in Advent occurs between December 18 and December 24 * Kwanzaa is from December 26 to January 1 * Marathon races held in December **Fukuoka, Japan **Las Vegas, Nevada, United States **Singapore **Taipei, Taiwan **Honolulu, Hawaii, United States == Historical Events == File:Rosa Parks Bus.jpg Bus]] File:Map of Finland-en.svg, which declared independence on December 6, 1917.]] File:Aan de Zuidpool - p1913-160.jpg and his expedition team at the South Pole on December 14, 1911.]] File:Stille nacht.jpg, which was first performed on December 24, 1818.]] File:Neptune-visible.jpg Neptune was observed by Galileo on December 28, 1612.]] * December 1, 1918 - The Kingdom of Yugoslavia is proclaimed.
