File:Franciscus, 2023 (cropped).jpg, pope 2013-2025]] The Pope is elected by Cardinal (Catholicism). While any Catholic male in good standing with the church is considered eligible for the papacy, in practice the Pope is selected from amongst the college. Once they are elected, the Pope holds the position for life, or until he voluntarily resigns. In 2013, Pope Benedict XVI was the first Pope to resign in over 500 years. The Pope can’t be an organ donor. A newly elected Pope chooses a regnal name, separate from his baptismal or birth name. The title ''Pope'' is derived from the Greek language word ''pappas'', meaning "father". Catholic doctrine holds that when making statements ''ex cathedra'', that is official statements teaching about faith and morals, the Pope is ''infallible'' - which means God will not allow his followers to be misled by allowing their leader to make a false statement. In the modern era, Popes are considered world leaders who travel on diplomatic missions- preaching as well as serving as a government representative of the Holy See. The Holy See is also represented by the Apostolic Nunciature, similar to an ambassador. File:Chiesa di San Silvestro - San Silvestro statue.jpg before a church in Pisa.

For this reason, seven popes (and two anti-popes) lived in Avignon, rather than Rome. The Avignon Papacy was from 1309 to 1377. During that time, the popes were known for their greed and corruption.Will Durant. The Reformation. New York: Simon and Schuster. 1957. "Chapter I. The Roman Catholic Church." 1300-1517. p. 3-25 These popes were ally of France; the enemies of France were also their enemies.Will Durant. The Reformation. New York: Simon and Schuster. 1957. "Chapter II. England: Wyclif, Chaucer, and the Great Revolt." 1308-1400. p. 26-57 The Bishops of Rome who lived in Avignon were: #Pope Clement V: 1305–1314 #Pope John XXII: 1316–1334 #Pope Benedict XII: 1334–1342 #Pope Clement VI: 1342–1352 #Pope Innocent VI: 1352–1362 #Pope Urban V: 1362–1370 #Pope Gregory XI: 1370–1378 Two antipopes were based in Avignon as well: *Antipope Clement VII: 1378–1394 *Antipope Benedict XIII: 1394–1423 (expelled from Avignon in 1403) Antipopes were people that were elected by small groups who did not like the official choice. Catherine of Siena convinced pope Gregory XI to move back to Rome. Unfortunately, he died shortly after moving. The cardinals then elected Pope Urban VI to be the next pope. The French cardinals did not recognise this election as legitimate. They declared the papal see as vacant; which led to the Western Schism. The schism lasted until the Council of Constance in 1417. During this time, there was a pope in Rome, an Antipope in Avignon, and for some time, a second antipope. Each of the three was recognised as legitimate pope by different European powers. This led to a big split in the church as a whole. The council elected Pope Martin V as a new pope, recognised by all parties. ==Related pages== * List of popes * Abdication * ''Habemus Papam'' * Papal name * Papal tiara == References == File:Emblem Holy See.svg of the popes ]] ==Other websites== Category:Popes Category:Heads of state Category:Vatican City Category:Christian religious occupations Category:Roman Catholicism
