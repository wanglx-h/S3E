A '''London Borough''' is a district of Greater London. There are 32 of them, including one that also call itself a separate city - the City of Westminster (where Buckingham Palace and the Houses of Parliament are) and the City of London (the oldest part of London). Each Borough has its own local government. {| | City of London City of Westminster Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham London Borough of Wandsworth London Borough of Lambeth London Borough of Southwark London Borough of Tower Hamlets London Borough of Hackney London Borough of Islington London Borough of Camden London Borough of Brent London Borough of Ealing London Borough of Hounslow London Borough of Richmond upon Thames Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames London Borough of Merton | image:LondonNumbered.png | London Borough of Sutton London Borough of Croydon London Borough of Bromley London Borough of Lewisham London Borough of Greenwich London Borough of Bexley London Borough of Havering London Borough of Barking and Dagenham London Borough of Redbridge London Borough of Newham London Borough of Waltham Forest London Borough of Haringey London Borough of Enfield London Borough of Barnet London Borough of Harrow London Borough of Hillingdon |} Category:London boroughs
