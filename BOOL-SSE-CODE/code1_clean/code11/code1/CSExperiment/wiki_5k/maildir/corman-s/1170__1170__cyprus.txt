Cyprus is in Asia, along with being apart of the Middle East and the Levant. The north part of the island is governed by the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. It is also closer to Africa than to Europe. The capital is Nicosia. The country of Cyprus does not include the whole island. There are two small British territories on the island named Akrotiri and Dhekelia. However, most countries do not accept Northern Cyprus as a legitimate country. The official languages are Greek language and Turkish language. In 2019, 4 million tourists visited the country. It is estimated that Cyprus earned 2.7 billion euros in that year. Tourism is very important to the country, as tourism made up 23% of its economy in 2020. == History == Cyprus has had people for some 13,000 year. During the Bronze Age its copper mines became important. Cyprus was conquered in turn by various mainland empires, and became part of the Ottoman Empire in 1570. Greece had already been conquered. The British Empire took control of Cyprus from 1878 until 1960. Cyprus became independent from the British Empire in 1960 following the London and Zürich Agreements of 19 February 1959. Makarios III became its first president. In 1960-1974 there was tensions between Greek and Turkish Cypriots and in 1974, Turkey sent troops to occupy northern Cyprus. Greek Cypriots moved south to get away from them, and Turkish Cypriots moved north to get away from the Greeks. Negotiations for a unified island have been held several times without success. In 2004, Cyprus joined the European Union. On 1 January 2008 Cyprus adopted the Euro, the single European currency. Although the official currency of Northern Cyprus is the Turkish lira, many shops accept Euros and British pounds. North Cyprus Property Consultants|url=https://northcyprusinternational.com/north-cyprus-currency/|access-date=2021-03-05|website=North Cyprus Property|language=en-GB}} == Geography == Cyprus is the third largest island in the Mediterranean Sea, after the Italian islands of Sicily and Sardinia. There are two mountain ranges, the Troodos Mountains and the smaller Kyrenia Mountains. The Pedieos River is the longest on the island. The highest point on Cyprus is Mount Olympus (Cyprus) at . The Republic of Cyprus is only on the southern two-thirds of the island (59.74%). The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus is the northern third (34.85%) and rest are Akrotiri and Dhekelia owned by the British. Headlands of Cyprus include * Cape Greco in the southeast (commons:Category:Cape_Greco), * Cape Apostolos Andreas in the northeast * Cape Gata in the south * Cape Kormakitis in the north * Cape Zevgari in the south == Politics == The Republic of Cyprus is a constitutional presidential republic. Each president is elected for a five-year term. The president has a lot of power. Cyprus is the only member of the European Union that is governed by a presidential system of government. It is one of few countries (along with San Marino) to have had a democratically elected communist government, in office from 2008 until 2013. Since 2013 governing party has been the Democratic Rally. The European Union issued a warning in February 2019 that Cyprus, an EU member, was selling EU passports to Russian Oligarchys. This would allow organised crime syndicates to get into the EU. In 2020 leaked documents revealed a range of former and current officials from Afghanistan, China, Dubai, Lebanon, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, Ukraine and Vietnam who bought a Cypriot citizenship before a change of the law in July 2019. Cyprus and Turkey have been engaged in a dispute over the extent of their exclusive economic zones. It was apparently caused by the potential for oil and gas exploration in the area. ==Districts== The Republic of Cyprus is divided into six districts: Nicosia, Famagusta District, Kyrenia District, Larnaca District, Limassol District and Paphos District. These are not the same as those of Northern Cyprus. ==Cities== Nicosia (north and south) |div_1 = Nicosia DistrictNicosia |pop_1 = 200,452 |img_1 = Fascinating view of Nicosia during day Republic of Cyprus.JPG |city_2 = Limassol |div_2 = Limassol DistrictLimassol |pop_2 = 154,000 |img_2 = View of Limassol 01.JPG Nicosia is the capital and largest city of Cyprus. |city_3 = Strovolos |div_3 = Nicosia DistrictNicosia |pop_3 = 67,904 |img_3 = Izgled-Strovolos-5.jpg |city_4 = Larnaca |div_4 = Larnaca DistrictLarnaca |pop_4 = 51,468 |img_4 = Larnaca 01-2017 img31 Salt Lake.jpg |city_5 = Famagusta |div_5 = Famagusta DistrictFamagusta |pop_5 = 42,526 |city_6 = Lakatamia |div_6 = Nicosia DistrictNicosia |pop_6 = 38,435 |city_7 = Kyrenia |div_7 = Kyrenia DistrictKyrenia |pop_7 = 33,207 |city_8 = Paphos |div_8 = Paphos DistrictPaphos |pop_8 = 32,892 |city_9 = Kato Polemidhia |div_9 = Limassol DistrictLimassol |pop_9 = 22,369 |city_10 = Aglandjia |div_10 = Nicosia DistrictNicosia |pop_10 = 20,783 }} == Related pages == * Cyprus at the Olympics * Cyprus national football team * List of rivers of Cyprus == References == == Other websites == * [http://www.cyprus-tube.com Cyprus Videos] * [http://cyprus.europe-countries.com Cyprus Pictures] * [http://www.europe-atlas.com/cyprus-map.htm Cyprus Map] * [http://www.cypruslinks.com/ CyprusLinks.com] * [http://www.windowoncyprus.com/ Cyprus Tourist Guide] Category:European Union member states Category:Republic of Cyprus Category:Commonwealth member states
