File:Mucha-Moët & Chandon Crémant Impérial-1899.jpg ''Moët & Chandon Crémant Impérial'' poster (1899) Colour lithography]] A '''poster''' is a large piece of printed paper that has a message, usually with picture of something. Posters are made to be shown in public on a wall or other flat surfaces. They were the main form of public advertising before the WWW, and they are still used. Posters are used for advertising, education, propaganda, and design.Hillier, Bevis 1969. ''Posters''. London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson.Barnicoat, John 1979. ''Posters: a concise history''. London: Thames & Hudson. They may also be copies of famous works of art. == Chromolithography and the poster == Chromolithography (color lithography) was invented by Engelmann & Son, who were granted a patent in 1837.Twyman, Michael 1970. ''Lithography 1800–1850''. Oxford University Press. p160 After that, it was a matter of time before it reached full commercial development. Because of its low production costs, over the 50 years after the American Civil War, millions of chromolithographs were printed and were sold for under $10. Louis Prang, a Bostonian, produced fine-art subjects, such as still lifes, landscapes, and classical subjects.Gallo, Max 2002. ''The poster in History''. W.W. Nevertheless, it was only after 1847 that the Jules Chéret posters showed their real potential.Hutchinson H.F. 1968. ''The Poster: an illustrated history from 1860'', chapter 2. London: Studio Vista. . === Examples === ====Jules Chéret==== Image:Cheret, Jules - Le Pays des Fees (pl 181).jpg| In 1858 Chéret printed his first color poster in France. His art excelled in showing the body in movement.David Raizman 2003. ''History of modern design: graphics and products since the Industrial Revolution''. Laurence King. Image:Cheret, Jules - Les Saxoleine.jpg| Hand-lettered titles were used in harmony with the design. Chéret used design as the dominant features while reducing the text to a minor role. Image:Cheret, Jules - Carnivale Poster.jpg| The women of Chéret's posters, playful, elegant, and lively were very different from previously depicted prostitutes or puritans. Image:Cheret, Jules - Humber Cycles.jpg| Chéret minimized the role of the text. In this poster, all of the relevant information is said in two words. ===19th century posters in the US=== *General source:Margolin, Victor 1975. ''The golden age of the American poster''.

When he arrived in America in 1888, he was one of the leaders in the Art Nouveau movement. He created posters for ''Scribner'''s and ''Century'' magazines.Stanley Appelbaum 1990. ''The Complete «Masters of the Poster»: all 256 color plates from «Les Maîtres de L'affiche»''. Courier Dover Image:Louis John Rhead - Century Magazine.jpg| In the 1890s Rhead designed nearly one hundred posters. In England and the U.S. he did memorable posters for magazines: ''Cassell's Magazine'', the ''Weekly Dispatch'', ''The Century'', ''St. Nicholas'', ''Harper's'', ''The Bookman'' and ''Scribners'''. Image:Louis Rhead-The Sun1.jpg | Many consider his use of colors startling, and his compositions sophisticated. He created artwork that in his time looked modern and vanguard. Image:Louis Rhead-Morning Journal.jpg| In 1895 he won a gold medal for ''Best American Poster Design'' at the first International Poster Show in Boston. By the late 1890s, the popularity of poster art declined and Rhead turned his skills to book illustration."Louis Rhead Obituary", ''New York Times'' (July 30, 1926) ====Edward Penfield==== Image:Aetna dynamite.jpg |Edward Penfield was the “originator of the poster in America". Edward studied painting under the impressionist George de Forest Brush around 1890. He is mostly known for his advertising ‘placards’ for ''Harper's New Monthly Magazine''. Image:CU Baseball.jpg |Penfield’s first published work appeared in ''Harper's Weekly'' in 1891. In his early works, Penfield did ink and watercolor wash illustrations in a similar style to the older generation of graphic artists.Wilczak, Susan A.

Taschen == Posters in the first half of the 20th century == Posters were used for war propaganda, to encourage young people to enlist in the army, and to sell government war bonds. From a strictly artistic view, the posters were unimaginative and far from the masterpieces of the late 19th century posters. The posters almost all came with a caption to bang the message home.
