File:Black triangle2.svg A '''triangle''', otherwise known as a '''trigon''', is a shape, or a part of 2D Space (physics). It has 3 (number) straight sides and three Vertex (geometry). The three angles of a triangle always add up to 180° (180 Degree (angle)). It is the polygon with the least possible number of sides. A triangle with vertices ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' is written as \triangle ABC. The study of geometry related to triangles is called trigonometry. Modern computers usually use triangles to make more complex graphic images or shapes. == Types of triangles == File:Isosceles-right-triangle.jpg Triangles can be grouped according to how many of their sides are equal: * if all the three sides of a triangle have the same length, then it is an '''equilateral triangle'''. * if a triangle has two sides with the same length, then it is an '''isosceles triangle'''. * if all the three sides of a triangle have different lengths, then we have a '''scalene triangle'''. Triangles can also be grouped by their angles: * if a triangle has a right angle, that is, if one of the angles of that triangle measures 90° (90 degrees), then it is a '''right triangle'''. The opposite side to the right angle is the hypotenuse. * if a triangle has an obtuse angle, that is, if one of the angles of that triangle is larger than 90°, then it is an '''obtuse triangle'''. * if a triangle has only Acute angle, that is, if all the angles of that triangle are less than 90°, then it is an '''acute triangle'''. {| width=50% |- | File:Triangle.Equilateral.svg|Equilateral triangle File:Triangle.Isosceles.svg|Isosceles triangle File:Triangle.Scalene.svg|Scalene triangle File:Triangle.Right.svg|Right Angled triangle File:Triangle.Obtuse.svg|Obtuse Angled triangle File:Triangle.Acute.svg|Acute Angled triangle |} == Area == File:Triangle (acute) bh.PNG The area of a triangle is equal to base times height times one half. area= \frac{base \times height}{2} ==Related pages== * Law of sines * Pythagorean theorem * Sierpinski triangle * Reuleaux triangle == References == Category:Polygons
