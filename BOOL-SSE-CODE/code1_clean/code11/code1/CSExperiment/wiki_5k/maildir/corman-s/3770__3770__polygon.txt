File:Assorted polygons.svg A '''polygon''' is a closed two-dimensional shape. It is a Plane (mathematics) figure that is made up of a number of sides. These are also called edges or Line segment. Each side is connected to another one by a corner, or vertex. Each pair of connected sides makes an angle. These sides and angles can be different from one another, or they can all be the same. Polygons made of only sides of the same length (equilateral) and angles the same width (equiangular) are called Regular polygon. A square (geometry) is a polygon because it has four sides. The smallest polygon in Euclidean geometry or "flat geometry" is the triangle, which has three sides and three corners. On a sphere, there can also be a digon and a henagon. If the edge lines of the polygon do not cross each other, the polygon is called ''simple''; otherwise it is ''complex''. In computer graphics, polygons (especially triangles) are often used to make graphics. == Gallery == Complex polygon.svg|A complex pentagon Simple polygon.png|A simple concave hexagon Heptagon2 (PSF).svg|A non-regular heptagon Irregular octagon.svg|A non-regular octagon Decagon (PSF).png|A non-regular decagon Regular polygon 99.svg|A enneacontakaienneagon (a polygon with 99 sides) == List of polygons == {|class="wikitable" |- |+ '''Polygon names and miscellaneous properties''' |- !style="width:20em;" | Name !style="width:2em;" | Sides !style="width:auto;" | Properties |- |monogon || 1 || Not generally recognised as a polygon,Grunbaum, B.; "Are your polyhedra the same as my polyhedra", ''Discrete and computational geometry: the Goodman-Pollack Festschrift'', Ed.
