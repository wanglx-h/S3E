This replaces the console, which is simply a black screen with text on it. KDE Plasma is a popular piece of software for users of Linux and UNIX. Plasma runs on top of the X Window System, which runs on top of any UNIX-like operating systems like Linux and Apple Macintosh OS X. Since KDE SC 4.0, many KDE programs also run on Microsoft Windows. == KDE releases == The following table lists when each version of KDE was released. {| class="wikitable" style=" font-size: 85%; text-align: left;" ! colspan="2"|Timeline of when KDE was released. |- !Date !!
