The chief town and capital was Weimar. == History == Saxe-Weimar and Saxe-Gotha were the two original Ernestine Duchies. They both gradually shrank in size as land in Thuringia was divided among sons.. In 1741 Duke Ernest Augustus I of Saxe-Weimar inheritated the Duchy of Saxe-Eisenach. Ernest Augustus II, who succeeded in 1748, died in 1758, and his young widow, Anna Amalia, Duchess of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, became regent for her infant son, Charles Augustus. The regency of Anna Amalia and the reign of Charles Augustus were important in the history of Saxe-Weimar. Both intelligent patrons of literature and art, Anna Amalia and Charles Augustus attracted to their court the leading scholars in Germany, including Goethe, Schiller and Herder, and made Weimar an important cultural centre. Charles Augustus joined Prussia in the Napoleonic Wars. After France won the Battle of Jena, Saxe Weimar was forced to join the Confederation of the Rhine in 1806. In 1809 Saxe-Weimar and Saxe-Eisenach, which had been separate duchies with the same duke became one country as the Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach. == Dukes of Saxe-Weimar == * Johann Wilhelm, Duke of Saxe-Weimar (1554 – 1573) * Frederick Wilhelm I, Duke of Saxe-Weimar (1573 – 1602), son of Johann Wilhelm * Johann, Duke of Saxe-Weimar (1602 – 05), son of Johann Wilhelm * Johann Ernst I, Duke of Saxe-Weimar (1605 – 20), son of Johann * Wilhelm, Duke of Saxe-Weimar (1620 – 62), son of Johann. * Johann Ernst II, Duke of Saxe-Weimar (1662 – 83), son of Wilhelm * Wilhelm Ernst, Duke of Saxe-Weimar (1683 – 1728), son of Johann Ernst II * Johann Ernst III, Duke of Saxe-Weimar (1683 – 1707), son of Johann Ernst II * Ernst August I, Duke of Saxe-Weimar (1707 – 48), son of Johann Ernst III * Ernst August II Konstantin, Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (1748 – 58), son of Ernst August I * Karl August, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (1758 – 1809), son of Ernst August II Merged with Saxe-Eisenach to form Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach ==Related pages== * Ernestine duchies == References == * * [http://www.bartleby.com/65/sa/SaxeWeim.html Saxe-Weimar] , ''The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia'', Sixth Edition, Columbia University Press (2001 – 2005), accessed December 22 2005 == Other websites == * [http://www.friesian.com/germany.htm German genealogies] * [http://genroy.free.fr/swe.html Genealogy of Dukes of Saxe-Weimar] Category:States of the Confederation of the Rhine Category:States of the Holy Roman Empire Category:Thuringia Category:Weimar
