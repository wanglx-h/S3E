File:Scared Child at Nighttime.jpg in an uncertain environment]] '''Fear''' is a feeling or an emotion. When a person has fear, they are '''afraid''' or '''scared'''. A person who fears something does not want it to happen. The fear response comes from sensing danger. It leads to the fight-or-flight response. In extreme cases of fear (horror and terror) there may be a freeze response or paralysis. In humans and animals, fear is adjusted by cognition and learning. Thus fear is rational or appropriate, or it is irrational or inappropriate. An irrational fear is called a phobia. Fear is the body's way of protecting itself from doing things that may be wikt:danger. For example, if one has a fear of jumping off a cliff, he/she will not do it. This saves one from death. In this case, fear is a good thing but in others, it can be bad. An example of fear being bad is if it stops one from doing something important, like going to see a doctor. Methods of controlling phobias include facing the fear over and over so the effect of the phobia becomes less until it stops being a phobia. There is only a small set of basic or innate emotions and fear is one of them.Öhman A. 2000. Fear and anxiety: Evolutionary, cognitive, and clinical perspectives. In M. Lewis & J.M.

It has been preserved throughout evolution. == References == == Related pages == *Anxiety Category:Basic English 850 words Category:Emotions
