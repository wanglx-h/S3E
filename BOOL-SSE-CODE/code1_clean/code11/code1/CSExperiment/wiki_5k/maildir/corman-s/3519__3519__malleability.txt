Subject: Malleability
'''Malleability''' is a substance's ability to deform under pressure (compressive stress). If malleable, a material may be flattened into thin sheets by hammering or rolling. Malleable materials can be flattened into metal leaf. One well-known type of metal leaf is gold leaf. Many metals with high malleability also have high ductility. Some do not; for example lead has low ductility but high malleability. Malleability is a physical property of matter, usually metals. The property usually applies to the family groups 1 to 12 on the modern periodic table of elements. It is the ability of a solid to bend or be hammered into other shapes without :wikt:broken. Examples of malleable metals are gold, iron, aluminum, copper, silver, and lead. Gold and silver are highly malleable. When a piece of hot iron is hammered it takes the shape of a sheet. The property is not seen in non-metals. Non-malleable metals may break apart when struck by a hammer. Malleable metals usually bend and twist in various shapes. Zinc is malleable at temperatures between 100 and 200°C but is brittle at other temperatures. == How is malleability measured? == There are two ways to measure it. The first is to measure the pressure or compressive stress that a material withstands before it breaks. The other test involves measuring the thickness of a metal sheet before it breaks. == Related pages== * Ductility ==References== Category:Metals Category:Physical properties
