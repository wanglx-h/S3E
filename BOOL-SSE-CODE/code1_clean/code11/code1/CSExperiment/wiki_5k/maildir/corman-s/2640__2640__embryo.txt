It is the term used for any animal or plant,technically, any multicellular organism ploidy eukaryote from the first cell division until birth, or Egg (biology), or germination in plants. In humans, it is called an embryo until about eight weeks after fertilisation, and from then until birth it is called a foetus (US: fetus). The development of the embryo is called '''embryogenesis''', and the study of embryos is called embryology. The development of an embryo passes through various stages: the blastula, a hollow ball of cells; the gastrula, migration of cells; morphogenesis; Tissue (biology) differentiation, and so on. In organisms that sex, once a sperm fertilizes an ovum, the result is a cell called the zygote, which has DNA from each of the two parents. In plants, animals, and some protists, the zygote divides by mitosis to produce an '''embryo'''. == Related pages == *Developmental biology == References == Category:Biological reproduction Category:Developmental biology he:עובר#התפתחות עובר האדם
