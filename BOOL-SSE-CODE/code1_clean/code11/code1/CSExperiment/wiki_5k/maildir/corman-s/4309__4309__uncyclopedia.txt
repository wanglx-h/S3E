It is a parody website. Uncyclopedia was started by Jonathan Huang and his friend named "Stillwaters". It was made on January 5, 2005. Uncyclopedia's logo is a hollow potato named Sophia. Its color is Desert sand (color). This makes fun of Logo of Wikipedia. It's a comedy wiki that pretends to be useful. Every page is filled with jokes and not real informations. Users make fun of things by creating pages about them. They have a guide on writing called HTBFANJS (How To Be Funny And Not Just Stupid). This page helps users learn how Uncyclopedia is not like Wikipedia. It also helps people write so it matches the rest of Uncyclopedia.File:New-Bouncywikilogo.gifMost encyclopedias try not to have opinions on things. They just try to tell facts. Uncyclopedia has its own opinions about things. These opinions are often silly. For example, Uncyclopedia thinks that Oscar Wilde was the best man ever. These opinions become memes that are added into jokes all over Uncyclopedia. ==References== == Other websites == *[https://en.uncyclopedia.co/ Uncyclopedia] Category:Websites established in 2005 Category:Wikis Category:MediaWiki websites
