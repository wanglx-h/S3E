Subject: Leader
A '''leader''' is somebody whom people follow. A leader has authority. For people to accept a leader, his or her leadership must therefore be legitimate. File:ClintonMandela.jpg]]Because people follow a leader, the leader can make people do things. A leader can therefore make people work together towards a common goal.Edwin A. Locke, ''The Essence of Leadership: The Four Keys to Leading Successfully'' (New York: Lexington Books; Toronto: Maxwell Macmillan Canada; New York: Maxwell Macmillan International, 1991), p. 2 An example of a leader is the head of government of a country. People within the government ''follow'' the leader, and citizens look to the head of government for inspiration and guidance. Sometimes, when a head of government lacks legitimacy, people will stop following him or her. The head of government is therefore no longer able to lead properly. This may result in a new election, or in worst case civil war. A group with no leader is called '''leaderless'''. == References == ==Related page== *Charisma ==Other websites== *[http://www.in-mind.org/issue-5/the-vision-thing.html 'The Vision Thing': How Effective Leaders Cultivate and Co-ordinate Social Identity in Order to Promote Followership] *[https://www.jivansutra.com/success/leader-meaning-in-hindi/ Leadership Qualities] Category:Politics de:Führung
