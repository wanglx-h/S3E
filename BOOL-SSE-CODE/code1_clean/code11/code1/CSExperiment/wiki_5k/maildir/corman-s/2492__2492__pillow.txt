File:Throw Pillow.JPG A '''pillow''' is a soft cushion that a person puts under their head when they are sleeping in a bed. A pillow is made from two pieces of cloth that are sewn together and stuffed with a soft material, such as feathers, duck down, or synthetic batting (man made soft stuffing). Pillows are usually Rectangle. Pillows are covered with a fabric sheet called a pillowcase. The pillowcase protects the pillow from getting dirty. The word ''pillow'' comes from Middle English ''pilwe'', from Old English ''pyle'' (akin to Old High German ''pfuliwi'') and from Latin ''pulvinus''. The word ''pillow'' was first known to be used before the 12th century. == History == There is no clear inventor of the pillow. Millions of years ago, animals learned to use pillows. An early example is Monkey resting their heads on their arm. Many animals, including Bird, use wood and stone nests as pillows. Many Domestication animals have also learned to make use of human-made pillows and Cushion. They also rest on members of their own and other species for the same reason. === Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt === In ancient Mesopotamia, people slept on stone pillows. Pillows were a status symbol. Early pillows were rectangular and had grooves shaped for the head. Pillows showed the wealth of a person — the more a person owned the wealthier they were. Ancient Egypt used pillows as a solution to back, neck and shoulder pain. They also prevented insects from crawling in their hair, mouth or nose at night. Anicent Egyptian pillows were made out of wood and stone and looked like stands. These pillows were mostly used for the deceased. == References == Category:Home
