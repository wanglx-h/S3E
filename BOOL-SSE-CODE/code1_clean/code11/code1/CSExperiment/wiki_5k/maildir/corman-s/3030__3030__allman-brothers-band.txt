It originally formed in 1969 with Duane Allman (slide guitar), Gregg Allman (vocals, organ), Dickey Betts (guitar), Berry Oakley (bass guitar), Butch Trucks (drums) and Jai Johanny "Jaimoe" Johanson (drums). In 1971, soon after their first album went gold, Duane and Berry were killed in separate motorcycle accidents in the group's hometown of Macon, Georgia. The group still released more albums and songs, most notably ''Ramblin' Man'' and ''Jessica'', which were their biggest hits. ''Rolling Stone'' ranked them 52nd on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time in 2004. The band is still touring as of 2008. ==Discography== ;Studio albums * ''The Allman Brothers Band (album)'' (1969) * ''Idlewild South'' (1970) * ''At Fillmore East'' (1971) * ''Eat a Peach'' (1972) * ''Brothers and Sisters'' (1973) * ''Win, Lose or Draw'' (1975) * ''Enlightened Pogues'' (1979) * ''Reach for the Sky'' (1980) * ''Brothers of the Road'' (1981) * ''Seven Turns'' (1990) * ''Shades of Two Worlds'' (1991) * ''Where it All Begins'' (1994) * ''Peakin' at the Beacon'' (2000) * ''Hittin' the Note'' (2003) ==References== ==Other websites== * [http://www.allmanbrothersband.com/ Official Allman Brothers' website] * [https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/theallmanbrothersband The Allman Brothers Band] at RollingStone.com Category:American rock bands Category:Blues bands Category:Musical groups from Florida Category:Musicians from Jacksonville, Florida Category:Southern rock bands Category:Musical groups established in 1969 Category:1969 establishments in the United States Category:1960s establishments in Florida Category:1976 disestablishments in the United States Category:20th-century disestablishments in Florida Category:Musical groups established in 1978 Category:1978 establishments in the United States Category:1970s establishments in Florida Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1982 Category:1982 disestablishments in the United States Category:Musical groups established in 1989 Category:1989 establishments in the United States Category:1980s establishments in Florida
