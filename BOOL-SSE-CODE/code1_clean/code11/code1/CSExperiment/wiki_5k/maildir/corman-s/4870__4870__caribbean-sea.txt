The sea is southeast of the Gulf of Mexico. This entire sea covers an area of . It is bordered by Cuba, Hispaniola and Puerto Rico in the north, Central America in the west and South America in the south. This sea is also as deep as the oceans. Its deepest point is believed to be even lower than 25,220 ft (7,686 m). That makes this point one of the lowest points on the surface of the earth, and the Caribbean Sea one of the deepest seas in the world. The Caribbean Sea has many islands, which are popular among North American tourists because of their tropical climate. The Caribbean Sea is famous around the world as a tourist destination. == History == Christopher Columbus came across a group of islands in the Caribbean region. When he did so, he thought he had reached another part of the world. Because of this, he named the islands the ‘West Indies’. However, later it was realized that he found an entire region. It still had its natural resources. The name ‘Caribbean’ was later given to it by the Amerindian tribe, the Caribs. That is how it got its name: the Caribbean Sea. == Other websites == Category:Seas of the Atlantic Ocean
