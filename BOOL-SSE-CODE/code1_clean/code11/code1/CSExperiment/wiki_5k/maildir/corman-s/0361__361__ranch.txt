File:ANNUAL SPRING ROUNDUP OF CATTLE RAISED ON EXPERIMENTAL FARM OPERATED BY EPA'S LAS VEGAS NATIONAL RESEARCH CENTER - NARA - 548955.jpg A '''ranch''' is a farm for raising cows, horses, sheep or other livestock. Most ranches are large, but they can be any size. The word ''ranch'' is from the Spanish language word "rancho". It is used in American English and Canadian English. People who use a ranch are called '''ranchers'''. A ranch may be on private or public land. The desert areas of the western United States have many ranches, because there is much land that is not very good for crops. There are also many in desert areas of Australia, where they are called Station (agriculture). Someone who takes care of the livestock may be called a stockman or cowboy. ==Related pages== *Agriculture category:Farms
