It is an island near the center of the Mediterranean Sea, south of Sicily. Although it is geologically located on the African Plate, Malta is recognized as a European country. The capital (city) of Malta is Valletta. Around 500,000 people live in Malta and it is one of the most densely population countries in the world. Malta is 316 sq km, which makes it one of the List of countries by area countries and the smallest in the European Union. Its many city and towns grew close to each other over time. == Language == Maltese language is the national language of Malta. It is a Semitic languages similar to the Maghrebi Arabic of North Africa, with a high amount of influence from Romance languages, in particular Italian, and more recently English. Maltese and English language are the official languages in line with the constitution of the country. A majority of the people of Malta can speak three languages; Maltese, English and Italian language. == Money == Malta had its own currency, called the Maltese Lira until 2008. The Maltese ''Lira'' was better known as the Maltese ''Pound'' because of the strong links to the United Kingdom. One Maltese Lira consisted of 100 ''cents''. In 2008 Malta joined the Euro countries in adopting the Euro as the National Currency. == History == People have lived in Malta since at least 5200 BC. The island has some key archeology sites dating from early times. Malta became well known as the base of the Knights Hospitaller. They moved to Malta after being forced to leave Palestine and then Rhodes, in Greece. In 1565 they survived a great attack by the Ottoman Empire. The history of the knights at Malta continued the strong Roman Catholicism beliefs in the country that were started by the Norman and Spanish rulers. In 1798, Napoleon took control of Malta. The France rule was not popular and in 1800 Maltese rebels invited the British Royal Navy to come to the island. This led to 200 years as a United Kingdom colony and independent Commonwealth of Nations member. During World War II, Malta was attacked this time by the Axis forces. The entire island was symbolically given the George Cross for heroism. Malta became independent in 1964 and a republic in 1974. In 2004 Malta joined the EU and in 2008 Malta joined the Euro. ==Notes== == Other websites == * [https://www.welcome-center-malta.com/ Maltese Relocation and Travel Guide] * [http://www.holidaysmalta.info/ Malta travel guide and information] * [http://www.maltawiki.com Malta Wiki - Malta Popular Encyclopedia] * [http://www.destinationmalta.com/ Malta holidays and hotels] * [http://www.guidetomalta.net/ Malta travel guide] * [http://www.malta.cc/ Malta] * [http://malta.world-travel.com.mt/ Malta Travel Guide] Category:Malta Category:Italian-speaking countries Category:European Union member states Category:Phoenician colonies Category:1974 establishments in Europe Category:Commonwealth member states Category:English-speaking countries
