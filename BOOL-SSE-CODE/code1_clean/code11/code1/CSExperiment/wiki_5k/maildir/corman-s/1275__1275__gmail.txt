It can be accessed on the World Wide Web, by POP3, or by IMAP. Some of the competitors to Gmail are Yahoo, Hotmail, and Inbox.Com. The space given to any Gmail member is increased a small amount every second, and as of July 26, 2012, Google provides each account with about 10272 Megabyte of space. == Google Apps == Google Apps is a service from Google that was created in February 2006 as Gmail for your domain. It is to allow system administrators of a company or organisation to create email accounts for their own domain. == Trademark issues == In the United Kingdom (UK), the trademark "Gmail" was owned by another company before Gmail by Google was started. Thus, the United Kingdom uses a domain of "googlemail.com" for their users, and the logo has the words of "Google Mail" instead of the normal "Gmail". In September 2009 Google began to change the branding of UK accounts back to Gmail following the resolution of the trademark dispute. ==References== ==Other websites== * [https://mail.google.com/ Gmail Website] Category:Google Category:E-mail
