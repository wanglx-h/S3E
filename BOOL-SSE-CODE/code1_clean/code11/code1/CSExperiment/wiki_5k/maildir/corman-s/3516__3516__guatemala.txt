Its culture is a mix of both Mayan and Spanish cultures from the colonial America. Guatemala has many languages, a total of 23. Because of its natural beauty, it is a popular tourist destination. Its weather changes often because of the mountain range which crosses the center of the country. The capital of Guatemala is Guatemala City. Guatemala is the world's largest producer and exporter of cardamom. Its neighbors are Belize, Mexico, El Salvador and Honduras. ==Population== Guatemala has the largest population in Central America. More than fourteen million people live in the 22 Guatemalan departments. Most of the population is made up of mestizo (mixed race) people, who are a combination of Native and European people. Mestizo are 40% of the population. Native Mayan people are 49% of the population, while 9% are direct descendants of Spanish people and Germany people. Black people are 2% of the population. == History == The capital was moved several times because of natural disasters. The first city was destroyed when the volcano Volcan de Agua erupted, forcing the move to what today is called Antigua Guatemala. This city was destroyed by earthquakes. Finally, the capital was moved to Guatemala City.
