Subject: Peptic ulcer
A '''peptic ulcer''' is an ulcer of the stomach or duodenum. The duodenum is the first part of the small intestines. It is the tube that food goes through when it leaves the stomach. ''Peptic'' means talking about the stomach. Gastric ulcers are peptic ulcers in the stomach. Duodenal ulcers are peptic ulcers in the duodenum. == Global statistics == File:Peptic ulcer disease world map-Deaths per million persons-WHO2012.svg File:peptic ulcer disease world map - DALY - WHO2004.svg for peptic ulcer disease per 100,000inhabitants in 2004 Disease and injury country estimates|url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/estimates_country/en/index.html|access-date=2024-05-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091111101009/http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/estimates_country/en/index.html |archive-date=11 November 2009 }}. ]] The lifetime risk for developing a peptic ulcer is approximately 5% to 10%. Men and women are equally as likely to have them. The amount of deaths was much higher until the last decades of the 20th century, then dropped. Deaths caused by peptic ulcer deaths globally in 2015 was 267,500. == Causes == File:Helicobacter pylori.jpg ]] Most ulcers are caused by an infectious disease from bacteria. This bacteria is called ''Helicobacter pylori''. 90% of gastric ulcers and 75% of duodenal ulcers are from ''Helicobacter pylori'' infection. Other things can make ulcers worse. But these things are less important than ''Helicobacter pylori''. These other things are: * Drugs called Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, medicine used for pain and inflammation. Aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen are NSAIDs. * Smoking cigarettes * Old age * Stress from diseases or injuries like pneumonia and burns == Symptoms and signs == The most frequent symptom is pain in the stomach. Pain is usually in the top of the abdomen below the ribs. Some people also feel pain go up to the chest. Other symptoms are: * Vomiting * Blood in vomit – this can be red. This can also look like coffee grounds * Black Fecess * Waves of Pain or Burning Vomiting red blood while having other symptoms is a serious sign. == Diagnosis == * Endoscopy – looking inside a person's stomach with a camera that goes through their mouth and down to their stomach * Test on the air someone breathes out to look for ''Helicobacter pylori'' infection * Blood test to look for ''Helicobacter pylori'' infection * Feces antigen test * Small sample taken from the affected body area or the ulcer * X-Ray: imaging of the GI tract. Ulcers in the body can be found this way, also called an upper GI series The best way is ''endoscopy''. But this costs more money. Endoscopy is done by a medical specialty called a ''gastroenterologist'' (a doctor who knows much about the digestive system.) A good thing about endoscopy is finding other diseases if there is no peptic ulcer. The symptoms of peptic ulcer can be from other diseases. Endoscopy can diagnose these other diseases. == Treatment == Treatment often entails the use of antibiotics to kill H. pylori; reducing or stopping the use of NSAIDs; and reducing or blocking the effects of stomach acid to assist in the ulcer's healing. Antacids such as Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) or H-2 Blockers may be used to reduce stomach acid, or cytoprotective agents such as sucralfate or misoprostol may be used to protect the stomach lining from the acid. ==References== Category:Diseases and disorders of the digestive system
