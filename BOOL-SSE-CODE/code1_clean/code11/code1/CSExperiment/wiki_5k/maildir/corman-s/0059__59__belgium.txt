Its capital, Brussels, is the home of many organizations including the European Union and NATO. Belgium is bordered by Netherlands in the north, Germany to the east, Luxembourg to the southeast and France to the south. Belgium has an area of . Around 11.6 million people live in Belgium. It is a founding member of the European Union and is home to its headquarters. == Regions == There are three regions in Belgium. The regions are mainly based on language and culture. Flanders and Wallonia are both split up into five Province each. * Flanders is the name of the northern half of Belgium, just south of the Netherlands. Most of the people in this region, called the ''Flemish people'', speak Dutch language. * Wallonia is the name of the southern half of Belgium, just north of France. Here, most of the people, the ''Walloons'', speak French language. There is a small part of Wallonia next to the border with Germany where the people speak German language. * The Brussels-Capital Region, where the capital of Brussels is found, is in the middle of the country, but surrounded by Flanders Enclave. It used to be Dutch-speaking, but today French is mostly spoken, with some Dutch. The population is about 60% Dutch-speaking, 39% French-speaking, and 1% German-speaking (the so-called ''Deutschbelgier''). To look after all these groups, Belgium has a complex system of government with highly autonomous regions. ==History== File:Map Burgundian Netherlands 1477-en.png (orange, brown and yellow areas) and the Bishopric of Liège (green)]] The name 'Belgium' comes from ''Gallia Belgica''. This was a Roman province in the northernmost part of Gaul. Before Roman invasion in 100BC, the ''Belgae'', a mix of Celts and Germanic peoples, lived there. (Paperback 512pp: ; Revised edition (2002), Hardcover 636pp: ) The Germanic Franks tribes during the 5th century brought the area under the rule of the Merovingian kings. A slow shift of power during the 8th century led the kingdom of the Franks to change into the Carolingian Empire.Cook (2002), p. 3 The Treaty of Verdun in 843 divided the region into Middle Francia and West Francia. They were vassals either of the King of France or of the Holy Roman Emperor. Timeline of Burgundian and Habsburg acquisitions in the Low Countries were united in the Burgundian Netherlands of the 14th and 15th centuries. The Eighty Years' War (1568–1648) divided the Low Countries into the northern Dutch Republic and the Southern Netherlands. Southern Netherlands were ruled by the Habsburg Spain and the Austrian Habsburgs. This made up most of modern Belgium. After the French Revolutionary Wars: Campaigns of 1794, the Low Countries were added into the French First Republic. This ended Austrian rule in the area. Adding back the Low Countries formed the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. This happened at the end of the First French Empire in 1815. The Belgian Revolution was in 1830. Leopold I of Belgium became king on 1831. This is now celebrated as Belgium's National Day. File:Wappers - Episodes from September Days 1830 on the Place de l’Hôtel de Ville in Brussels.JPG of 1830'' (1834), by Egide Charles Gustave Wappers, Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]] The Berlin Conference of 1885 gave control of the Congo Free State to Leopold II of Belgium. Millions of Congolese people were hurt or killed, mostly to make rubber, and Leopold became very wealthy. In 1908 the Belgian state took control of the colony after a scandal about the deaths. Germany invaded Belgium in 1914. This was part of World War I. The opening months of the war were very bad in Belgium. During the war Belgium took over Ruanda-Urundi (modern-day Rwanda and Burundi). After the War, the districts of Prussia of Eupen-Malmedy were added into Belgium in 1925. Battle of Belgium and under German control until 1944. After World War II, the people made king Leopold III of Belgium leave his throne in 1951. This is because they thought he helped the Germans. Belgium joined NATO as a founding member. In 1960 the Belgian Congo stopped being under Belgian rule. Two years later Ruanda-Urundi also became free. == Geography == Belgium is next to France, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Its total area is 34,143square kilometers (including sea area). The land area alone is 30,689km², of which 195km² or 0.64% are inland and coastal waters. Belgium has three main geographical regions. The coastal plain is in the north-west. The central plateau are part of the Anglo-Belgian Basin. The Ardennes (forest) uplands are in the south-east. The Paris Basin reaches a small fourth area at Belgium's southernmost tip, Belgian Lorraine. The coastal plain is mostly sand dunes and polders. Further inland is a smooth, slowly rising landscape. There are fertile valleys. The hills have many forests. The plateaus of the Ardennes are more rough and rocky. They have caves and small, narrow valleys. Signal de Botrange is the country's highest point at 694 metres (2,277ft). ===Regions=== Belgium is divided into three regions: Flemish Region (Flanders), Walloon Region (Wallonia), and Brussels-Capital Region (Brussels Region or Brussels - also the name of the city): {| class="wikitable" | style="text-align:left" ! style="width:110px;"| Region ! style="width:110px;"| Dutch name ! style="width:110px;"| French name ! style="width:115px;"| Capital ! style="width:115px;"| Largest city ! style="width:50px;"| Area (km²) [https://statbel.fgov.be/nl/themas/bouwen-wonen/bodembezetting-volgens-het-kadasterregister Bodembezetting volgens het Kadasterregister], Statbel ! style="width:70px;"| Population (2022) |- | Brussels-Capital Region || '''Brussels Hoofdstedelijk Gewest''' || '''Région de Bruxelles-Capitale''' || Brussels (Dutch: Brussel) (French: Bruxelles) (German: Brüssel) || Brussels || 162 || 1,222,637 |- | Flanders || '''Vlaanderen''' || Flandre || Brussels ¹ || Antwerp (city) ¹(Dutch/German: Antwerpen) (French: Anvers) || 13,626 || 6,698,876 |- | Wallonia ² || Wallonië || '''Wallonie''' || Namur (city) (Dutch: Namen) || Charleroi || 16,901 || 3,662,495 |} ¹ The city of Brussels does not lie in Flanders Region and therefore cannot be the largest city of this region. ² German name: Wallonie(n): the very eastern part of the Walloon Region is officially German-speaking, the so-called German-speaking Community of Belgium. ===Provinces=== Flanders and Wallonia are divided into provinces.
