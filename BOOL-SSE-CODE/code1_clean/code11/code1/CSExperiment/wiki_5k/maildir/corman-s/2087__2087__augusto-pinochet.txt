In 1970, Allende was narrowly elected in a close three-way race. Western countries like the United States were concerned about Allende. There was discontent in Chile in 1973, with some groups trying to destabilize the government of Allende. On September 11th, 1973, the Chilean military led a coup d'état against Allende in which they attacked the Presidential Palace in Santiago. Allende committed suicide, and Pinochet took power as the leader of a military council known as a junta. The junta began cracking down on Allende supporters. About 3,000 Chilean people died because of Pinochet's rule and many other people were tortured. The first days of his rule saw the most deaths, and in the weeks after the coup, Allende supporters were arrested and locked in a football stadium in Santiago. Many were released a few months later, but some were imprisoned and mistreated for years. Pinochet introduced many neoliberal free market policy bringing growth and great economic progress to Chile, but also increased inequality and poverty among the people. In economic affairs, Pinochet's rule was influenced by the ideas of Milton Friedman. In 1980, a plebiscite (without electoral registries) was held and Pinochet was kept in power. The coup d'état that was launched to overthrow Allende and put Pinochet in power was supported by the United States, as was Pinochet's regime. The US government has never admitted being involved, but they did support Pinochet while he was in power. The government of the United Kingdom was also pro-Pinochet. In 1988, there was a plebiscite in Chile. The people were asked whether Pinochet should rule for another eight and a half years. About 56% of the people did not want that. Pinochet, under pressure from other countries was forced to accept the results, and stepped down from power in 1990. Patricio Aylwin became the next president. Pinochet kept his responsibilities as head of the military until 1998. After this, he became a senator for life, but had to leave senate in 2002. He was not arrested because the Supreme Court of Chile said he suffered from dementia. In May 2004, judges said that was not true. On December 13 he was placed under house arrest. Judges in Spain tried to put him on trial for the many crimes against the human rights he committed while leader of Chile. ==Death== Pinochet died from congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema on December 10, 2006 in Santiago, Chile, a week after a heart attack, aged 91.[http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2006/12/10/internacional/1165772627.html?a=9226ef1866a7f79b7121e16dc29be1b4&t=1165774791 Muere el ex dictador Chileno Augusto Pinochet] ''EFE'' His remains were later cremated (Pinochet's request) to avoid vandalism on his tomb. == References == == Other websites == * [http://www.cidob.org/es/documentacio/biografias_lideres_politicos/america_del_sur/chile/augusto_pinochet_ugarte Extensive bio by Fundación CIDOB] (in Spanish) * [http://pinochet-biography.excathedra.dk Augusto Pinochet (1915–2006) – A Biography] * [http://www.france24.com/france24Public/en/special-reports/20061211-dossier-pinochet-dies.html France 24 coverage] – Augusto Pinochet's Necrology on France 24 * [http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/special_report/1998/10/98/the_pinochet_file/newsid_198000/198306.stm BBC coverage] (special report) * [http://www.chacabuco.org/ Documentary Film on Chilean Concentration Camp from Pinochet's Regime: Chacabuco] * [http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/news/20000919/index.html CIA Acknowledges Ties to Pinochet’s Repression] from The National Security Archive * [http://www.cyberussr.com/hcunn/for/chile-73.html Chile under Allende and Pinochet] * [http://www.memoriaviva.com/ Human rights violation under Pinochet] * [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,60-2497858,00.html The Times obituary] * [http://dollarsandsense.org/archives/2004/0904cypher.html Analysis of economic pol] Category:1915 births Category:2006 deaths Category:Chilean generals Category:Presidents of Chile Category:Former dictators Category:Anti-communists Category:Deaths from congestive heart failure Category:Deaths from myocardial infarction Category:Deaths from pulmonary edema Category:Disease-related deaths in Chile Category:People from Valparaíso
