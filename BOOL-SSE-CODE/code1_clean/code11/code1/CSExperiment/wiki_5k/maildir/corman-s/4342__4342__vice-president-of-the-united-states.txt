"Both governments could not be understood to exist at the same time. The new government did not commence until the old government expired. It is apparent that the government did not commence on the Constitution's being ratified by the ninth state, for these ratifications were to be reported to Congress, whose continuing existence was recognized by the Convention, and who were requested to continue to exercise their powers for the purpose of bringing the new government into operation. In fact, Congress did continue to act as a government until it dissolved on the first of November by the successive disappearance of its members. It existed potentially until 2 March, the day preceding that on which the members of the new Congress were directed to assemble."|first=John Adams|succession=United States presidential line of succession|salary=$284,600 per annum|website=}} The '''vice president of the United States''' ('''VPOTUS''') is the second highest executive officer of the Federal government of the United States after the president of the United States.
