'''Ibn Khaldun''' (; , ; 27 May 1332 – 17 March 1406) was an influential Arab thinker of the 14th century. His family were from Andalusia. Khaldun served the governments of the day in many ways. He was sometimes in prison. He lived in Marrakesh in Morocco for a time, and in Granada. Then he moved to Cairo, where he was a judge. The most famous book Khaldun wrote is the '''''Kitāb al-ʻIbar''''' (Book of Lessons), a history of the world. The first part, '''''Muqaddimah''''' (Introduction) is often used alone. This book is often credited as inventing sociology. He also wrote his autobiography. Ibn Khaldun lived a life in search of stability and influence. He came from a family of scholars and politicians and he intended to live up to both expectations. He would succeed in the field of scholarship much more so than in any other field. He died on 17 March 1406, one month after his sixth selection for the office of the Maliki qadi (Judge).
