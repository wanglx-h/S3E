The exciting evolution of rocks. ''LiveScience'']Rosing, Minik T. 2008. On the evolution of minerals. ''Nature'' '''456''' p457. It is formed from hot, molten magma. Its colour can be dark or light grey, brown, or even pink, according to the proportions of its minerals. It is called a plutonic rock because it forms under ground. The magma is forced between other layers of rock by the pressure under the Earth's surface. The magma cools and turns slowly into solid stone. Granite has many different types of minerals in it. These include quartz, feldspar, hornblende, and sometimes mica. As the magma cools, these minerals form crystals. The crystals can be seen easily if the granite is cut and polished. Granite is a common stone on Earth, and makes up a big part of the Earth's crust (the Earth's outer layer). It is usually found in the continental plates of the Earth's crust. Although it forms under the surface of the Earth, there are many places where it has been forced upwards by Plate tectonics. When plates in the Earth's crust move together, they get bent and pushed upwards. When this happens, granite mountains can be formed. == Origin == Granite forms from silica-rich (felsic) magmas. It is the most abundant Basement (geology) rock. It lies under the thin sedimentary rocks which cover the continents == Chemical composition == A worldwide average of the chemical composition of granite, by weight percent, based on 2485 analyses:Blatt, Harvey and Tracy, Robert J. 1997. ''Petrology''. 2nd ed, New York: Freeman, p66. {| | Silicon dioxide || |- | Aluminium oxide || |- | Potassium oxide || |- | Sodium oxide || |- | Calcium oxide || |- | Iron(II) oxide || |- | Iron(III) oxide || |- | Magnesium oxide || |- | Titanium dioxide || |- | Phosphorus pentoxide || |- | Manganese(II) oxide || |} == Uses == Granite is dense, and can be cut, carved and shaped. It is resistant to water and pollution, and has a range of different colours.Learn Science intermediate grades 5 to 6, by Mike Evans and Linda Ellis Kitchen benches are often made of polished granite. Granite is found in many countries of the world. Some countries have beautifully patterned granite which is quarried (cut in open mines) and sold for building material. == Gallery == File:The Cheesewring.jpg|The Cheesewring, a granite Tor (rock formation) on the southern edge of Bodmin Moor, Cornwall File:Migmatite gran violet.jpg|Polished granite from Brazil File:Granite wall of chapel La Hougue Bie, Jersey.jpg|A granite wall in Jersey File:GraniteElephant.jpg|A life-sized elephant carved from granite, India == References == Category:Igneous rocks
