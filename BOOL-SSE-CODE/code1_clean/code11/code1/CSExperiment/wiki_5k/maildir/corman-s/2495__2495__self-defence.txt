Subject: Self-defence
'''Self-defence''' means fighting off something or another person to protect yourself and maybe others. Ways of self-defence include martial arts or using a weapon. Sometimes, self-defense can cause serious harm to the other person. In most nations, you cannot be prosecution for this harm. In the United States, an act of self-defence can only count as self-defence if the victim is in a situation that can cause them serious injury or death. In international law all persons have the right to self-defence. == Defence of others == The law of self-defence is the same when you protect others. Generally, you must have a good reason or belief that you needed to defend yourself in self-defence. However, in many places, if the court decides that the defence may have been too extreme, the person may face criminal and civil charges. == References == == Other websites == * [http://nononsenseselfdefense.com/ No Nonsense Self Defense - Reliable information for dangerous situations] Articles by Marc MacYoung Category:Survival skills
