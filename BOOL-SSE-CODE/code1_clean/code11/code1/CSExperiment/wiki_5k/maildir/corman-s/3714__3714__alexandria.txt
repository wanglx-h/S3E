For nearly 300 years, it was the capital (city) of the Ptolemaic dynasty in Egypt. Some famous ancient Greek scientists, such as Euclid of Alexandria and Eratosthenes, lived there or studied there. It was home to the largest library in the ancient Western world, the Library of Alexandria. It was a wealthy city in its heyday, and remained the main way Egyptian grain went by sea to Ancient Rome. Rome depended greatly on Egyptian grain. Much of Alexandria sank below the sea in the 4th century. Some of her history is in the Mediterranean. After the Muslim conquest of Egypt in 641 AD, they did not want to have their capital at Alexandria, because it was too vulnerable to naval raids. They made a new capital, much farther upriver, on the east side of the Nile, and called it Fustat. Alexandria became less important. == References == == Other websites == *[https://web.archive.org/web/20150222034142/http://alexandria.gov.eg/default.htm Official website] *[http://www.ekalexandria.org Greek Community of Alexandria] Category:Capital of Egypt Category:Alexandria Category:4th-century BC establishments
