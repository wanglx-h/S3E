Its neighbours are Laos, Cambodia, Malaysia, and Myanmar. Its name was '''Siam''' until June 24 1939[https://archive.today/20120729065613/http://www.csmngt.com/thailand_history.htm Thailand (Siam) History], CSMngt-Thai. and between 1945 and May 11 1949. The word Thai (ไทย) comes from the ethnic group in the center of Thailand. Thailand is a constitutional monarchy. It has a king as a head of state, king Vajiralongkorn. Most people there (95 percent) follow the philosophy called Buddhism. Smaller number of people (4.4%), mostly to the south, follow Islam. Other religions in Thailand are Christianity, Hinduism, and Sikhism. There is an acting prime minister (as of July 2025); Paetongtarn Shinawatra is suspension.--> ==History== A Buddhist kingdom named Sukhothai was founded here in 1238. A century later, a bigger kingdom named Ayuthaya appeared south of Sukhothai. Later Sukhothai became a part of Ayuthaya. Ayuthaya existed for more than 400 years before its fall by the attack of a Burma kingdom. A soldier of Chinese people origin then founded a new capital city at Thonburi, and became King Tāksin. The founding of Bangkok as the capital city, was the start of the Rattanakosin Kingdom (1782–1932). It was founded by King Rama I of the Chakri Dynasty. Before 1932, Thailand was an absolute monarchy. On June 24, 1932, a group of people did a coup and changed Thailand to a constitutional monarchy. It was not until 1973 that Thai people voted for a Prime Minister in an election. In 1951, there was a failed coup - the Manhattan Rebellion. On September 19, 2006, the army did a coup d'état and took control from Thaksin Shinawatra's government. In May 2014, a new military coup d'état removed another government. Thailand had 12 coup d'etats, between 1932 and 2014. In October 2016, Vajiralongkorn became the new king. ===After the start of the 2025 Cambodian–Thai border crisis=== The 2025 Cambodia–Thailand border conflict started in May 2025;https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/3044755/cambodian-troops-agree-to-retreat-from-thai-border#google_vignette.
