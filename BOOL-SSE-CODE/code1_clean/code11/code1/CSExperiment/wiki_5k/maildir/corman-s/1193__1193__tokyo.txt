It is on the island of Honshu in the region of Kanto. Tokyo is the center of the Japanese government. The Tokyo Imperial Palace is in Tokyo but it's not actually public for tourists to visit. Tokyo is the center of business, trade, and industry of Japan. The city is the center of the largest metropolitan area in the world. It faces Tokyo Bay. It became the Capital (city) of Japan in the middle of 19th century, when its name changed from "Edo" to "Tokyo". Before then, Kyoto was the capital of Japan. The Emperor of Japan, or Tenno, lived in Kyoto. Edo was the place where the Tokugawa shogunate Shoguns lived. The city grew up under the control of the shoguns. Before then it was a small town on the sea. Edo means "the mouth of a river" in Japanese. Tokyo was destroyed by fires started by the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake. It was also badly damaged by bombs during World War II. After Japan lost the war, the city was rebuilt. == History == ===1457-1869=== Tokyo began as a small fishing village named Edo(江戸、えど). Edo was in the old Musashi Province.Nussbaum, "Provinces and prefectures" at . The Edo clan built walls to protect the town in the late 12th century. In 1457, Ōta Dōkan built Edo Castle. In 1590, Tokugawa Ieyasu made Edo his base. He became shogun in 1603, and the town became the center of his military government. This marked the beginning of the Edo period. During this time, Edo grew into one of the largest cities in the world. More than one million people lived there by the 18th century. Edo was not the capital of Japan. The emperor lived in the capital, Kyoto. However, since the shogun was more powerful than the emperor throughout Japanese history, Edo had more power. After about 263 years, the Meiji Restoration removed the shogun from power. In 1869, the 17-year-old Emperor Meiji moved to Edo. The old Edo Castle became the Kokyo, the Imperial Palace. ===1869-1943=== The Tokyo Prefecture and the city of Tokyo were established. This was the capital city until 1943. ===1943-present=== In 1943, Tokyo City and the "wikt:associated municipalities of what was formerly (1869-1943)" combined into one. Central Tokyo is built around major railway stations. Suburban railways were built relatively cheaply at street level. There are some highway. Tokyo suffered two major catastrophes in the 20th century. The 1923 Great Kantō earthquake left 140,000 dead or missing.[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1421140/Tokyo-Yokohama-earthquake-of-1923 Tokyo-Yokohama earthquake of 1923]. Britannica Online Encyclopedia. World War II was the other disaster for the city. The Bombing of Tokyo from 1944 through 1945 killed between 75,000 and 200,000 people and destroyed half the city. This was almost as much damage as the atomic bombs of Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined. Tokyo was completely rebuilt after the war. The 1964 Summer Olympics were a major world event. New high-rise developments such as Sunshine 60 started in the 1970s. ==Climate== Tokyo has a four-season humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification: ''Cfa'') with hot rainy summers and cool dry winters. }} ==Population== {| class="toccolours" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="1" style="float:right; margin:0 0 2em 2em; font-size:95%;" |+Population of Tokyo |- !

On July 1, 1943, Tokyo City was merged with to become a special government area. This made the wards different from other wards in Japan. Other wards of Japan are part of a larger city government, but these are not. Each ward is a Municipalities in Japan with its own mayor and assembly like the other cities of Japan. The special wards often use the word city in their official English name, e.g. Chiyoda City. The wards have a unique administrative relationship with the prefectural government. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government manages some public works such as water, sewer, and fire-fighting. To pay for these things, the prefecture collects the municipal taxes usually collected by a city.[https://web.archive.org/web/20060708203323/http://www.metro.tokyo.jp/ENGLISH/PROFILE/overview06.htm The Structure of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government] (Tokyo government webpage) The special wards of Tokyo are: {| |- style="vertical-align:top;" | * Adachi, Tokyo * Arakawa, Tokyo * Bunkyō, Tokyo * Chiyoda, Tokyo * Chūō, Tokyo * Edogawa, Tokyo * Itabashi, Tokyo * Katsushika, Tokyo | * Kita, Tokyo * Kōtō, Tokyo * Meguro, Tokyo * Minato, Tokyo * Nakano, Tokyo * Nerima, Tokyo * Ōta, Tokyo * Setagaya | * Shibuya, Tokyo * Shinagawa, Tokyo * Shinjuku, Tokyo * Suginami, Tokyo * Sumida, Tokyo * Taitō, Tokyo * Toshima |} Three wards of Tokyo make up the central part of the city.

There are very few buildings in Tokyo that are more than 50 years old. Popular places for visitors range from Tokyo Tower in the center of the city to Mount Takao out in the western countryside. Tokyo Skytree is a new tower and is the tallest in Japan. Traditional religious sights such as Meiji Shrine and Sensō-ji attract many tourists. The Imperial Palace can be seen in the middle of the city, but is not open to the public. == Transportation == Tokyo is the cultural, business, and political center of the country. It is also the center of many transport systems. There are many air, rail, sea, and road links in and out of the city. Local subway and bus systems serve every part of the city. Two commercial airports serve Tokyo. Haneda Airport is in the city limits next to Tokyo Bay. This airport is mostly for domestic travel. Most international flights to and from Tokyo go through Narita Airport in Chiba Prefecture(千葉県). Several Shinkansen '''super-express railway '''lines begin at Tokyo Station, including the Tōkaidō Shinkansen going west, and the Tōhoku Shinkansen going northeast. Tokyo Metro is the city's major Rapid transit system. Tokyo has a busy international and domestic port, but more traffic goes through the nearby port of Yokohama. There are domestic ferries to the islands of Tokyo, but also to other parts of the country such as Hokkaido. Many highways meet in Tokyo, including: the Chūō, Kan-Etsu, Tōhoku, and Tōmei Expressways. All highway distances in Japan start from zero at a marker at Nihonbashi, Tokyo. ==Related pages== * F.C.
