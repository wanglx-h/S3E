He was crowned as emperor on Christmas Day in 800. He was the older son of Pepin the Short of the Carolingian dynasty. When Pepin died, Charlemagne and his brother Carloman ruled together. When Carloman died in 771 Charlemagne became the only ruler of the Franks. == Life == The Franksm one of the Germanic peoples who had moved from over the Rhine River into the Roman Empire as it was falling apart, were by 700 the rulers of Gaul and much of Germania east of the Rhine. They also protected the Pope and the Roman Catholic faith. When their king, Pepin the Short, died, his sons, Charlemagne and Carloman were chosen to share the kingdom. They divided it into two parts: one half for Charlemagne, and the other for Carloman. Carloman died on December 4, 771, leaving Charlemagne as the leader of the whole Frankish Lingdom. Charlemagne was King of the Franks from 768 and King of the Lombards from 774. He was crowned Imperator Augustus (Emperor) in Rome on Christmas Day by Pope Leo III in 800. That started the Holy Roman Empire, which they hoped would be a kind of second Western Roman Empire; the Byzantines in Constantinople were still the Eastern Roman Empire. With many wars, Charlemagne spread his empire across much of Western Europe. Charlemagne fought in many wars over the course of his reign. He is known for using his sword, ''Joyeuse'', in each of the thirty years of war and the 18 battles in he fought. He also finally managed to conquer Saxony, which Roman Emperor Augustus had not been managed 800 years earlier. He converted the Saxons to Catholicism. He also had many schools built so that his people could learn. However, he also killed thousands of those who failed to convert. ==Death== Charlemagne's politics and plans failed, which led to his low self-esteem. His last years were spent in bed in deep Major depressive disorder. He died in 814, leaving his kingdom to his only son, Louis the Pious. The descendants of Charlemagne are called Carolingians. His family line died out in Germany in 911 and in France in 987. == Battles and campaigns == *During the Saxon Wars, also called the Saxon War or the Saxon Uprising, campaigns and insurrections lasted from 772 to 805 after Charlemagne first entered Saxony with the intent of conquest. == References == == Related pages == *Charlemagne Prize Category:740s births Category:814 deaths Category:Holy Roman Emperors Category:Frankish rulers Category:Carolingian dynasty Category:9th century in Europe
