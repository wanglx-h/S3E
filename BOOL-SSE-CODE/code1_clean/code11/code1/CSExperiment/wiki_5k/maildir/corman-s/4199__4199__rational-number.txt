Subject: Rational number
In mathematics, a '''rational number''' is a number that can be written as a Fraction (mathematics). The set of rational number is often represented by the symbol \mathbb{Q}, standing for "quotient" in English. Rational numbers are all real numbers, and can be Positive_number or negative. A number that is not rational is called Irrational_number. Most of the numbers that people use in everyday life are rational. These include fractions, integer and numbers with finite decimal digits. In general, a number that can be written as a fraction while it is in its own form is rational. == Writing rational numbers == === Fraction form === All rational numbers can be written as a fraction. Take 1.5 as an example, this can be written as 1 \frac{1}{2}, \frac{3}{2}, or 3/2. More examples of fractions that are rational numbers include \frac{1}{7}, \frac{-8}{9}, and \frac{2}{5}. === Terminating decimals === A wikt:terminating decimal is a decimal with a certain number of numerical_digit to the right of the decimal point. Examples include 3.2, 4.075, and -300.12002. All of these are rational. Another good example would be 0.9582938472938498234. === Repeating decimals === A repeating decimal is a decimal where there are infinity many digits to the right of the decimal point, but which follow a repeating pattern. An example of this is \frac{1}{3}. As a decimal, it is written as 0.3333333333... The ellipsis indicate that the digit '''3''' repeats forever. Sometimes, a group of digits repeats. An example is \frac{1}{11}. As a decimal, it is written as 0.09090909... In this example, the group of digits '''09''' repeats. Also, sometimes the digits repeat ''after'' another group of digits. An example is \frac{1}{6}. It is written as 0.16666666... In this example, the digit '''6''' repeats, following the digit 1. If you try this on your calculator, sometimes it may make a rounding error at the end. For instance, your calculator may say that \frac{2}{3} = 0.6666667, even though there is no 7. It rounds the 6 at the end up to 7. == Irrational numbers == The digits after the decimal point in an irrational number do not repeat in an infinite pattern. For instance, the first several digits of Pi_(mathematical_constant) are 3.1415926535... and so on. You can find some small repeats here and there, but pi as a whole will never fall into an infinite pattern, no matter how many digits you look at. == Arithmetic == * Whenever you add or subtract two rational numbers, you always get another rational number. * Whenever you multiply two rational numbers, you always get another rational number. * Whenever you divide two rational numbers, you always get another rational number (as long as you do not Division_by_zero). * Two rational numbers \frac{a}{b} and \frac{c}{d} are equal if ad = bc. ==Related pages== * Decimal * Fraction (mathematics) * Irrational number * Real number == References == Category:Numbers
