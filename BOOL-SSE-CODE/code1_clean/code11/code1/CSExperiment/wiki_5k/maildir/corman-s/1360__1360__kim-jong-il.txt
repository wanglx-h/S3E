He was the son of Kim Il-Sung. Official North Korean propaganda said that Jong-il was born on Mount Paektu (a holy mountain in Korea); but most historians think that he was born near Chabarowsk in the Soviet Union. The North Korean laws made him permanent ruler of North Korea for life. He was sometimes referred to as the "Dear Leader", but this was not an official title. His official title was "Chairman of the National Defense Commission of North Korea", "Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army" and "General Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea". Many people in North Korea were imprisoned or killed for speaking out against the Kim regime. Almost everyone in North Korea wore a small pin with a picture of Kim Jŏng-Il or Kim Il-Sŏng on it. The North Korean government told people of his death through the state Mass media on 19 December 2011. It was said that he had died two days earlier of "Human body and mental over-work". ==Early life== Kim Jong-il was born as '''Yuri Irsenovich Kim''' on 16 February 1941 or 1942 in either Korea under Japanese rule or the USSR . He was the son of Kim Il-Sung is was responsible for the Korean War in 1950-1953 . ==Leader of North Korea== ===Rising through the ranks=== In 1974 Kim Il-sung designated Kim Jong-il as his successor, solidifying the leadership transition within North Korea. Kim Jong-il's rise to power was marked by his gradual ascent within the North Korean political hierarchy. He began his official political career in the mid-1970s, holding various positions in the ruling Workers' Party of Korea. Over the years, he consolidated his influence and took on key roles in military and propaganda departments. By 1994, he succeeded his father, Kim Il-sung, as the Supreme Leader of North Korea. ===Rule (1994 – 2011)=== Following Kim Il-Sung's death in 1994, Kim Jong-il became North Korea's 2nd Supreme Leader. During his rule, North Korea experienced a devastating famine which resulted in millions of deaths due to starvation. In the early 2000s, Kim oversaw the development of nuclear weapons with a series of missile tests by launching rockets of the coast of Japan and South Korea. His "Military-First" policy exacerbated economic challenges, leading to widespread hardship for the North Korean people and political repression. ==Personal life== Kim Jong-il was a Stalinism. He believed in the North Korean Communist philosophy of Juche (self-reliance). He was afraid to travel on aeroplanes and traveled only on Railways. He was well known for his love of movies and luxury goods, especially caviar and Hennessey brand cognac, even though North Korea was one of the poorest countries in the world. Former United States United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright once gave Jong-il a present of a basketball signed by Michael Jordan when he visited North Korea because Jong-il was a fan of the National Basketball Association and of Michael Jordan. ==Death== File:The statues of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il on Mansu Hill in Pyongyang (april 2012).jpg On the morning of 17 December 2011, at the age of 69 or 70, Jong-il died of a heart attack while traveling. His funeral was held on 28 December, and as a result, Kim Jong-un was then elected as the new leader of North Korea. On 13 April 2012, Kim Jong-il was made Eternal Chairman of the National Defence Commission and Eternal General Secretary of the Workers Party of Korea. ==References== ==Other websites== * – Foreign Languages Publishing House, Pyongyang DPR Korea (1998) * [http://times.hankooki.com/lpage/opinion/200406/kt2004060817432954140.htm Born in the USSR] – Kim Jong-il's childhood. * [http://www.east-asia-intel.com/eai/Sample/2.html The many family secrets of Kim Jong Il] * [http://theseoultimes.com/ST/?url=/ST/db/read.php?idx=1643 "Hidden Daughter" Visits Kim Jong-il Every Year] (also includes photos of Kim during his youth) * [http://news.naver.com/news/read.php?mode=LSD&office_id=047&article_id=0000073978&section_id=100&menu_id=100 Kim's family tree] Category:1941 births Category:2011 deaths Category:Former dictators Category:North Korean military people Category:Presidents of North Korea
