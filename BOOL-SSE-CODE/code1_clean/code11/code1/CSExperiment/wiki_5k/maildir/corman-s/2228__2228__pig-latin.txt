'''Pig Latin''' is a language code or game and is most often used by children who speak English language. The usual rules are: # For words that begin with consonants, move the consonant to the end of the word and add "ay." # For words that begin with vowels, simply add "ay" to the end of the word."[http://www.idioma-software.com/pig/pig_latin.html Learning Pig Latin] " (1999) Pig Latin that one writes is sometimes written with dashes, between the first part and the "consonant-ay" letters, and sometimes it is not. A sentence can be "Is-thay is-ay an-ay example-ay of-ay Ig-pay Atin-lay ith-way ashes-day", or "Isthay isay anay exampleay ofay Igpay Atinlay ithoutway ashesday." In Pig Latin, this sentence: : Is-thay is-ay an-way example-ay of-ay Ig-pay Atin-lay. As-ay ou-yay an-cay ee-say, it-ay is-ay illy-say, ut-bay ots-lay of-ay un-fay or-fay ildren-chay. comes to mean: : This is an example of Pig Latin. As you can see, it is silly, but lots of fun for children. The British name for Pig Latin is "backslang". ==References== ==Other websites== *[http://wikihow.com/Learn-Pig-Latin Entry] An entry from wikiHow on learning Pig Latin.
