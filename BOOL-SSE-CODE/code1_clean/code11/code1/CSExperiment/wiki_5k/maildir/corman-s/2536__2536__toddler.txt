File:Very young child girl with blond hair sitting on beach.jpg '''A toddler''' is a very young child who is learning how to use their hands, stand and walk, and also how to communicate with others. Most children are toilet trained while they are toddlers. Even when toddlers can walk, they are often transported in a stroller, buggy, or pushchair when the walk is a long distance or when they're tired. Toddlerhood typically begins after age one and is over by the time the child is 4, but this can differ depending on the child. == Other websites == *[http://www.parentingnation.in/kids-weight-calculator Toddler Weight/Height Calculator] Category:Childhood
