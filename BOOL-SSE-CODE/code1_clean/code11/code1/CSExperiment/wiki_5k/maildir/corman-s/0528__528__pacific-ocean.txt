File:Pacific elevation.jpges and oceanic trenches.]] The '''Pacific Ocean''' is the largest ocean and covers one third of the surface of the entire world. The body of water is between Asia and Australia in the west, the Americas in the east, the Southern Ocean to the south, and the Arctic Ocean to the north. It joins the Atlantic Ocean at a line drawn south from Cape Horn, in Chile andArgentina, to Antarctica, and it joins the Indian Ocean at a line drawn south from Tasmania, in Australia, to Antarctica. As the Atlantic is slowly getting wider, the Pacific is slowly shrinking by folding the sea floor towards the centre of the Earth in what is called subduction. The bumping and grinding is so hard that there are many earthquakes and volcanoes when the wikt:pressure builds up and is quickly released as large explosion of hot Rock (geology) and dust. When an earthquake happens under the sea, the quick jerk causes a tsunami. That makes tsunamis more more common around the edge of the Pacific than anywhere else in the world. Many of the Earth's volcanoes are islands in the Pacific or on continents within a few hundred kilometers of the ocean's edge. Plate tectonics is another reason for the Pacific to be shrinking. ==Other websites== * [https://web.archive.org/web/20000815231325/http://www.epic.noaa.gov/epic/ewb/ EPIC Pacific Ocean Data Collection Viewable] on-line collection of observational data * [http://dapper.pmel.noaa.gov/dchart/ NOAA In-situ Ocean Data Viewer] plot and download ocean observations * [https://web.archive.org/web/20010701033128/http://floats.pmel.noaa.gov/floats/ NOAA PMEL Argo profiling floats Realtime Pacific Ocean data] * [http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/tao/jsdisplay/ NOAA TAO] El Niño data Realtime Pacific Ocean El Niño buoy data * [https://web.archive.org/web/20030214190723/http://www.oscar.noaa.gov/datadisplay/ NOAA Ocean Surface Current Analyses] – Realtime (OSCAR) Near-realtime Pacific Ocean Surface Currents derived from satellite altimeter and scatterometer data Category:Pacific Ocean
