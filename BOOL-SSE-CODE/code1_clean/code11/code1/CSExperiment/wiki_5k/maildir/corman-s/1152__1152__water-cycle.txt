It is present throughout the Solar System, and was part of the Earth from its formation. The source of the water was the same as the source of the Earth's Rock (geology): the cloud Particle which Condensation in the origin of the Solar System.Van Andel, Tjeerd H. 1994. ''New views on an old planet: a history of global change'' Chapter 14. 2nd ed, Cambridge. ==Processes== This is the process that water starts and ends in the water cycle. * The Sequence starts when water on the surface of the Earth Evaporation. Evaporation means the sun heats the water which turns into a gas * Then, water gathers as water vapour in the sky. This makes clouds * Next, the water in the clouds gets cold. This makes it become liquid again. This process is called condensation * Then, the water falls from the sky as rain, snow, sleet or hail. This is called precipitation * The water sinks into the surface and also collects into Lake, Ocean, or Aquifer. It evaporates again and continues the cycle * This whole process in which water evaporate and falls on the land and later flows back in river and pond is known as water cycle ==Human activities affecting water cycle== * Industry * Agriculture * Deforestation * Dam construction * Removing groundwater from Well * Water extraction from River ==Related pages== * Rock cycle * Geophysics * Hydrosphere * Carbon cycle * Coriolis effect * Ecohydrology ==References== Category:Water Category:Nature Category:Science Category:Physics Category:Weather Category:Earth sciences Category:Environmental science Category:Environmental chemistry
