File:PostItNotePad.JPG File:Wall with post-its.jpg A '''sticky note''' (or '''Post-it''' note) is a small piece of paper with a strip of glue along one edge that make it "sticky," so you can stick it to things. It was invented by Arthur Fry. The most common sticky note is the Post-it, which is made by a company called 3M. In 1974 a man named Arthur Fry came up with the idea for the sticky note. He used a glue that was originally too weak to be used for anything else, so the notes would come off easy. 3M started to sell Post-Its in 1980. In 2001, the patent for the glue that 3M uses on Post-it notes expired, so many other companies now make similar sticky notes. ==References== == Other websites == * [http://www.3m.com Official Post-It notes Website] * [http://notes.mastervb.net Post-It notes Generator] Category:Paper
