'''Colonization''' is the act of the people of a country settling in another area or country to rule the place. An early example is the settlers who went from the cities of Ancient Greece to start new City. In 1492, Christopher Columbus landed in the Americas. This is how the Europe learned that North America and South America were there. The Europeans colonized the Americas. Because of this, and the killing of many Native Americans, most people now living in North America are mostly Descendant of Europeans. Sometimes, science fiction stories talk about space colonization on Space station or Planet other than the Earth. ==Related pages== *Colony *Nazism *Fascism *Annexation *Colonialism *Imperialism *''Mein Kampf#The contents in short'' *Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)#Fascism *Protectorate *World War II *Nazi Germany *Decolonization *Russian Empire *German Empire ==References== Category:Colonialism Category:Imperialism Category:International relations
