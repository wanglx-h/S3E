File:Star Wars Logo.svg '''''Star Wars''''' is an American science fiction media franchise created by George Lucas. As of December 2019, nine movies in the main series have been made by Lucasfilm, released by 20th Century Fox, and distributed by Disney. The first Star wars movie came out in 1977. ''Star Wars'' has become so popular that there have been ''Star Wars'' books, video games, television shows, toys, spin-off movies/television series and more. It is also known for its iconic music by John Williams. With influences such as, ''Starcrash'', ''The Man Who Saved The World'', etc. ==Settings== File:Star Wars Galaxy Map KOTOR Quest.jpg === 'The Force' === The Force is a mystical power. Those who can harness if for good follow a religion known as the Jedi. It is a belief that the force flows through every living thing. In the words of Obi-Wan Kenobi: People who can control the Force with their minds get a number of psychic powers, such telepathy (reading others thoughts), telekenesis (moving things with their minds), precognition (sensing things before they happen), mind control (reaching people in their conscious to tell them commands they must follow), and the ability to heal others (they are healed by transferring one´s life force to another to heal their wounds) === The Jedi and the Sith === The Jedi are a group of beings who use the Force to bring peace and harmony to people, planets, and cultures. They are trained to use the force for good purposes. They are sworn enemies with another group called the Sith. The Sith are a group of beings who use the force as a power source; they are trained to use the force to gain ultimate power. The Sith normally use the force to gain power in battles with their enemy who are the Jedi. They also use the force to bring destruction to the universe and anything in their way. They are the antagonists, and they usually use red lightsabers in contrast to the variety of colors used by the Jedi. There are usually only two Sith, a master and an apprentice. === Lightsabers === The lightsaber is a dangerous and powerful weapon used by the Jedi and the Sith. It can be described simply as a light sword. These weapons are very special to a Jedi or Sith. They are custom built to special specifications by the Jedi or Sith. The Sith tend to take a Jedi's lightsaber as a prize if they win the battle. Many epic battles have been fought with lightsabers between the Jedi and the Sith. For the lightsaber to be a weapon it is powered by a special crystal called a kyber crystal. The kyber crystal comes in many different colors such as: Red, white, yellow, orange, and many more. The reason it is powerful and dangerous is that when someone touches the blade, one gets burned straight away. == Story == File:Star Wars characters at Madame Tussaud.jpg The main nine movies (Episodes 1 to 9) are about the Skywalker family. However, there are many television series, spin-off films, and other media which tell more of the story. === Episodes 1—3 === Two Jedi, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn, travel to a remote desert planet called Tatooine and find a young boy who is enslaved named Darth Vader.

Vader turns good and kills Palpatine to save Luke. Vader dies, the new Death Star is destroyed, and the Empire is defeated. === Episodes 7—9 === Thirty years later, the New Republic rules the galaxy. However, the Empire's followers have come together to form the First Order. They are fought by the Resistance, led by Leia, who had a son called Ben with Han. Ben was corrupted by Supreme Leader Snoke and became the First Order's commander, Kylo Ren. Luke rebuilt the Jedi but left because Ben killed Luke's students. Leia tries to find Luke, while Han fights the First Order with a scavenger called Rey (Star Wars) and a former Stormtrooper (Star Wars) called Finn. The First Order destroy the New Republic and Kylo Ren kills Han. Rey finds Luke, who refuses to teach her how to become a Jedi. Meanwhile, the First Order chase the Resistance.

A year later, the Resistance find out that Palpatine has come back from the dead and is the true leader of the First Order. They go on an adventure to find him. Rey finds out that Palpatine is her grandfather. Kylo Ren finally turns good after his mother, Leia, dies. Rey kills Palpatine with the help of the spirits of every dead Jedi.

They also tell more about things that did happen in the movies. For example, the book ''Death Star'' tells about the building and destruction of the space station from the original movie. It tells much about things seen in that movie but from the point of view of the people on the station. A different example is that in the Expanded Universe, sometimes the Sith are shown as the protagonists. Most of the stories in the Expanded Universe are about the rebuilding of the Republic after the Empire's defeat. They are set anywhere from the early Sith Wars which happened 5,000 years before Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi to more than one hundred years after Episode VI. == Media == === Movies === There are currently eleven live-action Movie and one Animated movies. Nine of the movies are labelled as "episodes". These movies are part of the "Skywalker Saga", which is the central story of the franchise and follows the story of Darth Vader. Episodes 4—6 form the Original Trilogy (1977—1983), Episodes 1—3 form the Star Wars prequel trilogy (1999—2005) and Episodes 7—9 form the Sequel Trilogy. {| class="wikitable sortable" |+The Skywalker Saga !No. !Trilogy !Title !Year !Director |- |1 | rowspan="3" |Prequel |Star Wars: The Phantom Menace |1999 | rowspan="4" |George Lucas |- |2 |Star Wars: Attack of the Clones |2002 |- |3 |Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith |2005 |- |4 | rowspan="3" |Original |Star Wars (film) |1977 |- |5 |''The Empire Strikes Back'' |1980 |Irvin Kershner |- |6 |Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi |1983 |Richard Marquand |- |7 | rowspan="3" |Sequel |Star Wars: The Force Awakens |2015 |J.

Some are based directly on the movie material, while others rely heavily on the non-canonical Expanded Universe (rebranded as ''Star Wars Legends'' and removed from the canon in 2014). ''Star Wars'' games have gone through three significant development eras, marked by a change in leadership among the developers: the early licensed games, those developed after the creation of LucasArts, and those created after the closure of the Lucasfilm division by Disney and the transfer of the license to Electronic Arts. ==== Early licensed games (1979–1993) ==== The first officially licensed electronic ''Star Wars'' game was Kenner's 1979 table-top ''Star Wars Electronic Battle Command''. In 1982, Parker Brothers published the first ''Star Wars'' video game for the Atari 2600, ''Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (1982 video game)'', followed soon the year later by ''Star Wars: Jedi Arena'', the first video game to depict lightsaber combat. They were followed in 1983 by Atari's rail shooter arcade game ''Star Wars'', with vector graphics to replicate the Death Star trench run scene from the 1977 film. The next game, ''Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'' (1984), has more traditional raster graphics, while the following ''Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back'' (1985) has vector graphics. Platform games were made for the Nintendo Entertainment System, including the Japan-exclusive ''Star Wars (1987 video game)'' (1987), an international ''Star Wars (1991 video game)'' (1991), and ''Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (1992 video game)'' (1992). ''Super Star Wars'' (1992) was released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, with two sequels over the next two years. ==== LucasArts and modern self-published games (1993–2014) ==== Lucasfilm founded its own video game company in 1982, becoming best known for adventure games and World War II flight combat games, but as George Lucas took more interest in the increasing success of the video game market, he wanted to have more creative control over the games and founded his own development company, LucasArts. Improved graphics allowed games to tell complex narratives, which allowed for the retelling of the films, and eventually original narratives set in the same continuity, with voice-overs and CGI cutscenes. In 1993, LucasArts released ''Star Wars: X-Wing'', the first self-published ''Star Wars'' video game and the first space flight simulator based on the franchise. It was one of the bestselling video games of 1993 and established its own series of games. The ''Rogue Squadron'' series was released between 1998 and 2003, also focusing on space battles set during the films. ''Dark Forces'' (1995), a hybrid adventure game incorporating puzzles and strategy, was the first ''Star Wars'' first-person shooter. It featured gameplay and graphical features not then common in other games, made possible by LucasArts' custom-designed game engine, the Jedi. The game was well received, and it was followed by four sequels. The series introduced Kyle Katarn, who would appear in multiple games, novels, and comics. Katarn is a former stormtrooper who joins the Rebellion and becomes a Jedi, a plot arc similar to that of Finn in the sequel trilogy films. A massively multiplayer online role-playing game, ''Star Wars Galaxies'', was in operation from 2003 until 2011. After Disney bought Lucasfilm, LucasArts ceased its role as a developer in 2013, although it still operates as a licensor. ==== ''EA Star Wars'' (2014–present) ==== Following its acquisition of the franchise, Disney reassigned video game rights to Electronic Arts. Games made during this era are considered canonical, and feature more influence from the ''Star Wars'' filmmakers. Disney partnered with Lenovo to create the augmented reality video game ''Jedi Challenges'', released in November 2017. In August 2018, it was announced that Zynga would publish free-to-play ''Star Wars'' mobile games. The ''Battlefront'' games received a canonical reboot with ''Star Wars Battlefront (2015 video game)'' in November 2015, which was followed by a sequel, ''Star Wars Battlefront II (2017 video game)'', in November 2017. A single-player action-adventure game, ''Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order'', with an original story and cast of characters, was released in November 2019. A space combat game titled ''Star Wars: Squadrons'', which builds upon the space battles from ''Battlefront'', was released in October 2020. == Upcoming projects == ===Movies=== *'''''Star Wars: Rogue Squadron''''' is a ''Star Wars'' movie that was released on December 22, 2023. The movie is written and directed by Patty Jenkins making her the first woman to direct a Star Wars film. According to Starwars.com, the movie "introduces a new generation of starfighter pilots as they earn their wings and risk their lives in a boundary-pushing, high-speed thrill-ride, and move the saga into the future era of the galaxy." *'''Untitled ''Rian Johnson'' Trilogy''' a trilogy is currently being worked on by Rian Johnson who wrote and directed ''Star Wars: The Last Jedi''. The trilogy was announced before the release of ''The Last Jedi'' but very little has been said about it.
