File:Baby.jpg A '''baby''' is a human younger than about 1 or 2 years old. Other terms can be used to describe the baby's stage of development. These terms do not follow clear rules and are used differently by different people, and in different regions. For example, ''infant'' may be used until the baby can walk, while some use "infant" until the baby is one year old. From birth until 3 months of age, a baby can be called a ''newborn''. Depending on how many weeks gestation at birth, newborns may be called wikt:early, post-mature, or full term. The word ''infant'' comes from Latin: ''infans'' means "unable to speak". At birth, many parts of the newborn's skull are not yet converted to bone, leaving "soft spots". Later in the child's life, these bones join together naturally. A protein called Noggin (protein) is responsible for the delay in an infant's skull fusion. During childbirth and birth, the infant's skull changes shape as it goes through the birth canal. Sometimes this causes the child to be born with a misshapen or elongated head. It will usually return to normal in a short time. Some religions have ceremonies that occur after a new baby is born, such as Baptism, which involves partly or fully covering the baby in water.

Sometimes, a woman's baby may die before or during its birth. Babies which have died in this way are called stillborn babies, or miscarried babies. ==References== ==Other websites== *[http://www.babyphotospictures.com/ Baby Pictures] Newborns, Infants and Toddlers * [http://www.parentingnation.in/kids-weight-calculator Kids Height/Weight Calculator] by Parenting Nation * [http://www.babyfoodmakerguide.com/guide/organic-baby-food/ Baby Foods Guide] Benefits of Organic Baby Food * [http://strollerlist.com/ Baby Stroller] by Stroller List Category:Family Category:Babies Category:Basic English 850 words Category:Childhood Category:Pregnancy and childbirth
