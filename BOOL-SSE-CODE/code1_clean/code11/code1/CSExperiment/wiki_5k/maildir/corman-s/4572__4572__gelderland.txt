The capital city is Arnhem, but Nijmegen and Apeldoorn are bigger. Other important cities are Zutphen, Doetinchem, Harderwijk and Tiel. About 2,134,000 people are living in Gelderland (2023). It is surrounded by the provinces of Limburg (Netherlands), North Brabant, South Holland, Utrecht (province), Flevoland and Overijssel and the Germany federal state North Rhine-Westphalia. The most important rivers are the Rhine (''Rijn''), the Waal, the IJssel and the Maas (border with North Brabant). The border with Flevoland is formed by the so-called ''randmeer'' ("border lake") of the Flevopolder. == History == In the 11th century, Guelders was a county. It was called ''Gelre'' in Dutch language and ''Geldern'' in German language. In 1339, it became a duchy. At first, it existed of the surroundings of the city of Geldern (now in Germany). By the end of the 14th century, it included most of the modern province of Gelderland and parts of the province of Limburg (Netherlands) and of the German District of Cleves (district). It became part of the Habsburg Netherlands in 1543, one of the Seventeen Provinces. == Other websites == * * [http://www.sdu.nl/staatscourant/gemeentes/gemprovin.htm#G interactive province map] * [http://geodata.prv.gelderland.nl/scripts/esrimap.dll?Name=Zakgeld2&Scherm=Start&Frames=Yes&Cmd=Show another map, more up-to-date, but the map is not interactive] * [http://geodata.prv.gelderland.nl/geostart.asp?appl=3 Detailed map] Category:Gelderland
