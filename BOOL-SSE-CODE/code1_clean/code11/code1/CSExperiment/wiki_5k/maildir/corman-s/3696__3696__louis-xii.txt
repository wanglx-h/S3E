He was born on June 27, 1462 in the Chateau de Blois, France. Louis's first wife was Jeanne of France, who was the daughter of Louis XI of France. At the time, Louis was not expected to become King of France. The King, Charles VIII of France, was a young man and could still have had children, but Charles had an accident and died suddenly. Charles was Jeanne's brother. Louis was Charles's cousin and next in line to the throne. When he became king, he had to end his marriage to Jeanne, partly because she was disabled and could not have children. Louis's second wife was Anne of Brittany, who was the daughter of Francis II, Duke of Brittany. Anne had been married to King Charles VIII until his death, but all of their children had died. As a result of her marriage to Charles, the dukedom of Brittany had become part of the kingdom of France. Louis wanted to keep Brittany, but in order to do so he had to marry Anne. After her marriage to Louis, Anne had two daughters, who were called Claude of France and Renee of France. In France, women were not allowed to rule the country, so Louis still wanted a son to become king after him. After Anne died, Louis married for a third time. His last wife was Mary Tudor, Queen of France, the sister of Henry VIII of England. She was many years younger than he was. Louis only lived for three months after their marriage. Because Louis had no sons, the throne went to Francis I of France, the husband of his daughter Claude. == Issue == {| class="wikitable" | colspan="14" align="center" |'''''By Anne of Brittany''''' |- !Name !Birth !Death |- |Claude of France |14 October 1499 |20 July 1524 |- |Unnamed son |late 1500/early 1501 |died young |- |Unnamed son |21 January 1503/07 |21 January 1503/07 |- |Renée of France |25 October 1510 |12 June 1574 |- |Unnamed son |January 1513 |January 1513 |} Category:1462 births Category:1515 deaths Category:Kings of France Category:House of Valois
