Subject: Musical instrument
'''Musical instruments''' are things used to make music. Anything that somehow produces sound can be considered a musical instrument, but the term generally means items that are specifically for making music. Musical instruments can be divided by type into: * string instruments (Pizzicato or Bow (music)) * wind instruments ** woodwind instrument ** brass instrument * percussion instruments * keyboard instruments An orchestra has instruments from four families: * Bow (music) instruments (e.g. violin) * Woodwind instrument (e.g. flute) * Brass instrument (e.g. trumpet) * Percussion instrument (e.g. drums) Some people think that the voice is a "natural musical instrument" because singing is a way to make music without any instrument at all.
