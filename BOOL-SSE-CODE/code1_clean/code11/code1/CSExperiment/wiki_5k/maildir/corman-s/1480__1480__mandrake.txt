The roots often look like man or woman, or can be easily made to resemble them. The plant has been used in witchcraft for a long time. According to this literature, the plant shrieks in pain, when it is pulled from the ground. This shriek is able to make a person deaf. He might also lose his mind, or even be killed, if he is unprotected. Mandrake (Mandragora officinalis) has been used as an Anaestesia for a long time. For this, it was usually prepared in an alcoholic solution. Category:Solanaceae
