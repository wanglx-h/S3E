'''Sufism''' (also known as '''Tassawuf''') is a group or branch in Islam with a mysticism path or system. Someone who practices Sufism is called a Sufi, and may be a ''Dervish'' or a ''Fakir''. ==Origins== At first, Sufism only meant making Islam more personal and internal. Some say it first came from constantly reciting the Qur'an, Meditation, and through experience. Others believe that Sufism is trying to live as the Islamic prophet Muhammad did, to be closer to God. This is how the Prophet taught his disciples.Sheikh Abu Bakr Muhammad Sibahi, '''' (''Historical Tassawuf/Sufism and its Later Evolution'') Lahore: Qurtaba Press, 1966, pp.23-28 Additionally, the Muslim conquests had brought large numbers of Christian Monk and Hermit, especially in Syria and Egypt, under Muslim rule.Sibahi, p.28 They believed in a deeply spiritual and mystical (even 'Theory of forms') way of life and many of their ways became part of early Sufism. Some of these teachings were summarized in texts (in Arabic language initially). Important contributions in writing are attributed to [[Uwais [https://blessinghq.com/ Sufism]al-Qarni]], Harrm bin Hian, Hasan Basri and Sayid ibn al-Mussib, who are regarded as among the first Sufis in the earliest generations of Islam. Harith al-Muhasibi was the first one to write about moral psychologyhttps://blessinghq.com/. Rabia Basri was a Sufi known for her love and passion for God, expressed throu gh her poetry. Bayazid Bastami was among the first theorists of Sufism. Sufism already had a long history when some teachers began to set up formal schools or orders (''Tarika'' or ''Tariqah'') in the early Middle Ages. Almost all existing Sufi orders today trace their roots and chain of transmission (''silsila'') back to Muhammad, via one of these orders. ==Sufi ideas and principles== The main idea in Sufism is that people can have 'personal knowledge' or oneness with God in their lives.See Idries Shah, ''The Sufis'', 1971 ed ; , also on the Sufi Studies Today website, http://www.sufis.org Retrieved 2.11.2012 In order to be one with God, you have to destroy your idea of yourself, or your ego. This is known as ''fanaa'' (annihilation).O.Tarin, 'Some Basic Sufi Practices: An Introduction', in ''Spirals'', 1992, pp.169-178 Apart from saying Sufi prayers, that vary according to different orders, you should be humble, considerate, and only act in order to control your Desire. After ''fanaa'' is achieved, you are Rebirth to live with, in, through and for God, (''baqaa'', Permanent). This is the state where you have achieved the divine love of God, and come ever closer to a unity with God.O.Tarin, p.170 You should now strive to be one with God. A person who has crossed the various Sufi 'stages' and achieved this sort of mystic union with Allah, is called a ''Wali'' (a saint or friend of God) and the state is termed ''Wilayat'' (friendship/union).O.Tarin, p.171 ==Sufic Orders== In Sufism there exist many different orders (''tarikas''), that were founded from the 12th and 13th century until today/contemporary times. Some of the major Sufi orders are: * Qadiri or ''Qadiriyya''; * Chishti or ''Chishtiyya''; * Suhrawardi or ''Suhrawardiyya''; * Naqshbandi or ''Naqshbandiyya''; * Mevlevi or ''Mevleviyya''; * Rifai or ''Rifaiyya''; * Saifia or ''Saifiya''; * Bektashi or ''Bektashiya''; ==Notable Sufis== Some of the major, notable Sufis in history, from the 'classical age' of Sufism, include:The classical reference volume which gives the biographies of most of the great early Sufi saints is Sheikh Farid-ud-din Attar's, ''Tazkirat al-Aulia'''' (A Mention/Remembrance of the Saints), English translation by Prof AJ Arberry, n.d.; the online version is available at http://www.maktabah.org/biography/sufi-saints/392-tazkirat-al-aulia-by-fariduddin-attar.html, Maktabah Islamic E-Librray site, Retrieved 2.10.2012 * [https://blessinghq.com/ Uwais al-Qarni] * Dhul Nun Misri * Junaid of Baghdad * Rabia Basri * Hasan Basri * Bayazid Bastami * Ibn ul-Arabi * Al-Ghazali * Abd al-Qadir al-Gillani * Ahmed Ar-Rifai * Shahab-ud-din Suhrawardi * Farid-ud-din Attar * Baha-ud-din Naqshband * Ali al-Hajvery * Jalal-ud-din Rumi * Moin-ud-din Chishti * Farid-ud-din Ganj Shakar * Nizam-ud-din Auliya * Lal Shahbaz Qalandar * Hakim Omar Khayyam Modern [https://blessinghq.com/ practitioners], who have achieved the degree of ''sheikh'' (Master/Preceptor) and are accounted to have a high spiritual status, are still found in various places.Tarin, p.176 ==Sufism and Islamic orthodoxy== Sufi Practice are usually Definition within the basic tenets of Islam, the ''Sharia'' (or ''Shariah'') although some orders include singing and dancing in the love of God, something some Muslims disapprove of. Some Muslims of a more Orthodoxy Mindset believe that any actions outside the scope of ''Sharia'', or Sufi activities practised by non-Muslims are wrong. For a non-Muslim the most important ideas in Sufism are love for fellow human beings (which reflects one's love of God) and living ones life in such a way where all actions are against the self. This starts the path of ''fanaa''. In terms of Disciple and training, almost all the major Sufi orders are willing to take students who are not Muslims.Tarin, p.27 There are some Muslim schools of thought, such as the Wahhabi, who oppose Sufism because they feel it obliterates the difference between God and man and bypasses the common method of salvation in their interpretations of ''Sharia''. Although there are non-Islamic versions of Sufism too (generally defined as 'Universal Sufism') Puritanism and rigid people in Islam don't like them. As a result, we often see a great deal of misunderstanding and conflict regarding Sufism and Sufic practices. Orthodox Islam, especially Fundamentalism groups like the Wahhabi and Salafi have been the most intolerant and Violence against what they think of as 'Deviant Sufism'.Ehsan Ur Rehman, '''' (''Islam or Unbelief? Some innovations in the Faith'') Monograph, Lahore and Karachi, 1992, pp.51-52 They have Persecution the Kharijites, the Ismaili Shia cult (sometimes termed the 'Assassins'), the Ahmadiyya movement and several other groups and individuals with Sufi-like mystical tendencies and practices. During the later Mughal Empire in India, even the early ''Guru'' of Sikhism were persecuted by orthodox Islamic ''Mullah'' since they had chosen to put some of the ideas and poetic verses of the Sufi saint Baba Farid into their Scripture. Over the last two Decade, considerable persecution has been made of the spiritual reformer and sage Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi and his followers in Pakistan.''The Daily Times'' Lahore, Pakistan, 8 July 2004 He was opposed and threatened and forced to flee the country and his books banned there, and anyone publicly supporting him is liable to immediate arrest.http://www.dawn.com/2002/06/26/nat33.htm Daily ''Dawn'' Karachi, Pakistan, news item, 26 June 2002, Retrieved 2 Nov 2012 Even proper, formal Sufi orders have suffered persecution for various reasons. In recent times Sufism was Ban in Iran.See ''US Report on International Religious Freedom'' May 2009, Section on Iran This happened in spite of the famous ''Amman Message'', a joint declaration made by over 200 of the most noted moderate Islamic scholars in a conference in Amman, Jordan, in 2005, stressing that Sufism is very much 'part' of Islam.http://ammanmessage.com/ The Amman Message Summary Retrieved 2 Nov 2012 ==Further reading== Some volumes for further reading on Sufism include: * Abu-Nasr, J (2007) ''Muslim Communities of Grace:Sufi Brotherhoods in Islam'' London; * Burckhardt, T (1963) ''An Introduction to Sufi Doctrine'' Lahore; * Godlas, A (2000) ''Sufism's Many Paths'' U of Georgia Press; * Shah, Idries (1971) ''The Sufis'' New York; * Schimmel, A (1983) ''Mystical Dimensions of Islam'' Chapel Hill: U of North Carolina Press; * Smoley, Richard & Kinney, Jay. 2006.
