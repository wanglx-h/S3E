An '''anteater''' is a mammal of the family '''''Myrmecophagidae''''' and the suborder '''''Vermilingua'''''. Anteaters live in South America and Central America. Anteaters eat ants and termites. They have long, sharp claws and a long, sticky tongue. The tongue can be up to 60 cm long, as long as a person's arm. The anteater opens an ant nest with its claws. Then it licks up the ants with its tongue. Large anteaters that move on the ground knuckle-walk, bending their front toes under when they move the way gorillas do. Small anteaters that live in trees do not do this. == Gallery == File:Myresluger2.jpg|A Giant Anteater.
