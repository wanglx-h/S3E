File:Hematiet (xndr).jpg '''Hematite''' or '''haematite''' is the main ore of iron. It is mostly iron(III) oxide. Millions of tons are dug up every year, much of it from banded iron formations. This is usually to feed to blast furnaces to make steel. It is a mineral related to corundum. It is an Oxide mineral. It has a metallic Luster (mineralogy). It has no cleavage (the way a mineral breaks). It has a Material fracture. The fracture is irregular and uneven. Hematite on the hardness scale is 5 to 6. It has a bright red to dark red streak. To find the streak, you take the mineral and run it across a plate of Glaze porcelain. The colours can be metallic grey to a dark, rough and earthy red colour. Hematite has the chemical formula of Fe2O3. ==Related pages== * Corundum *Iron(III) oxide *Rust Category:Oxide minerals Category:Ores Category:Iron minerals Category:Inorganic pigments
