It often has spices in it and is covered in a casing. Traditionally, a sausage casing is made of animal intestine, but can sometimes be made of plastic. There are many forms of sausages, including hot dog, pepperoni, bologna, and salami. Sausages often have meat from the animal's head, lips, cheeks, ears and other parts. Some have blood in them. Germany and United Kingdom sausages normally have a lot of "rusk," or bread crumbs, and they are less meaty than sausages from other countries. Vegetarian or vegan sausages are often made of products other than animal products, such as tofu. Sausages may be used as a meal, in a sandwich, or in other foods like stews. Sausages can be eaten as whole pieces, or they can be chopped up as already cooked pieces. Germany has regions that have special kinds of sausage. Sausages are some of the oldest German foods. ==Name origin== The word "sausage" was first used in English in the mid-15th century.
