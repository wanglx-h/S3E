As one of the first movies to use computer animations extensively, ''Tron'' has a distinctive visual style. The music for the movie was written by Wendy Carlos, and there were also two songs from the band Journey. Even though it got mixed success soon after its debut, ''Tron'' has gained a cult following thanks to its computer-generated imagery (CGI) and hero story. Several video games have been based on it. A twentieth anniversary DVD edition came out in 2002. In early 2005, Disney revealed plans for a sequel. The sequel was called ''Tron Legacy'' and was released in 2010. It tells the story of Flynn's son Sam. ==References== == Other websites == * Category:1982 science fiction movies Category:American science fiction movies Category:Cult movies Category:Disney movies Category:English-language movies
