He was born in Timisoara, Austria-Hungary to Germany parents. He was one of the world's best swimmers in the 1920s. He won five gold medals and set five then-Olympic records in swimming competitions at the Olympics in 1924 and 1928, and a bronze medal in water polo at the 1924 Olympics. He later played Tarzan in a series of movies in the 1930s and became a movie star. This made him a character actor. He then had trouble getting parts in other movies because of this. == Death == On January 20, 1984, Weissmuller died of pulmonary edema. He was 79. He was buried in Acapulco, Mexico, where he was living when he died. At his funeral, a sound recording of the ''Tarzan yell'' he had made famous in the movies was played three times, at his request. ==References== == Other websites == * Category:1904 births Category:1984 deaths Category:Actors from Chicago Category:American movie actors Category:Olympic bronze medalists for the United States Category:Olympic gold medalists for the United States Category:American swimmers Category:Deaths from pulmonary edema Category:Disease-related deaths in Mexico Category:Naturalized citizens of the United States Category:Sportspeople from Chicago
