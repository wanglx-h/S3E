It was captured by the Roman Republic in 222 BC. Milan became very successful under the Roman Empire. Milan was ruled by the Spanish in the 1500s and the Austrians in the 1700s. During the Renaissance and the Romanticism periods, Milan was a major cultural center in the whole of Europe, famous for its literature and opera. During the war, the city was badly affected by Allied bombings and during the 50s and 60s the city grew into being the wealthy and industrial metropolis it is today. == References == Category:Milan
