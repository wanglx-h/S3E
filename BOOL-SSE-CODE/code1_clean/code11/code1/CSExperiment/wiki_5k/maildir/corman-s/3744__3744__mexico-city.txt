Area of the Mexican Federal District that includes non-urban areas at the south }} '''Mexico City''' () is the capital (city) and largest city of Mexico. It is the most population city in the Western Hemisphere and the second most populous city in the world (after Tokyo). It is also one of the pollution cities in the world. The Aztec people were here before the Spain came and founded Mexico City. It was refounded in 1521 by Hernán Cortés. Today, about 8.5 million people live in the city, and about 18 million live in the Greater Mexico City urban area. The city of Mexico City ceased to exist in 1928. Since then, there is only the Federal District. Mexico City has 18.1 million people. It is the city with the second highest number of people in the world after Tokyo in Japan and just slightly more population than Mumbai in India. Including population within the recognized metro area of the city and also people living in the immediate surrounding area outside of the established border of the city the most populated cities in the world are: 1. Tokyo, Japan - 28,025,000, 2. Mexico City - 18,131,000, 3. Mumbai, India - 18,042,000, 4. São Paulo, Brazil - 17, 711,000, 5. New York City, USA - 16,626,000. ==History== Mexico City was first built in the 1520s after Hernán Cortés destroyed the Aztec city of Tenochtitlan. The Spaniards then emptied the basin of Lake Texcoco to keep it from flooding. By the late 1700s, Mexico City had over 100,000 people. However, there were many slums, which caused epidemics. There were political problems in the mid-1800s after Mexico became independent. More than 40 people ruled in the 40 years after the country became independent. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, electric light and natural gas were brought to the city. But there was a big difference between the rich western part of the city and the poor eastern part of the city. By 1930, Mexico City had 1,000,000 people. The city kept growing quickly. In 1968, the Olympic Games were in Mexico City. In 1985, an earthquake hit the capital. In the past few decades, there have been problems with crime and corruption. ==Environment== Mexico City has a high population density. It is also surrounded by mountains. This causes problems with air pollution. Sometimes Mexico City gets earthquakes. ===Geography=== Mexico City is in the Valley of Mexico at around 2,300 meters (7,800 feet) above sea level. Mexico City its divided by 16 boroughs: Álvaro Obregón, Azcapotzalco, Benito Juarez, Coyoacán, Cuajimalpa, Cuauhtémoc, Gustavo A. Madero, Iztacalco, Iztapalapa, Magdalena Contreras, Miguel Hidalgo, Milpa Alta, Tláhuac, Tlalpan, Venustiano Carranza and Xochimilco. Mexico City was originally built on a lake, Lake Texcoco, which is now mostly drained. The ecology of the area has been much changed by the draining. Many of its native species, such as the Axolotl, are extinct, or endangered species. The mountains Popocatépetl and Iztaccíhuatl are nearby. ===Climate=== Mexico City is in the tropics. But because its elevation is so high, it has a subtropical highland climate (''Cwb'' in the Köppen climate classification). This means temperatures are warm or mild year-round. It is a lot wetter in the summer than in the winter. Some parts of the city get frost in the winter.
