He was the god of the sky and thunder. His two brothers were Pluto (mythology) and Neptune (mythology), and his sister was Ceres. ==Life of Jupiter== Saturn, who was the previous king of the gods, began to swallow the children that he had with his wife Ops (Greek equivalent Rhea), when they were born. This was because he had been warned that one of his children would overthrow him. Saturn swallowed the children Neptune, Pluto, Ceres, Juno and Vesta. When Ops realized that she was pregnant with Jupiter, she had the baby secretly and moved to Crete, giving a stone wrapped in baby clothes to Saturn for him to eat. Saturn believed he had eaten Jupiter. ===Overthrowing Saturn=== After Jupiter was raised by his mother, his destiny was to overthrow Saturn, as revenge for all he had done to his brothers and sisters in the past. When Jupiter grew up, he made Saturn vomit up all of the children he had swallowed. All the brothers and sisters joined forces and overthrew Saturn. ===Battle of the Titans=== Then, with the help of the Cyclopes and the Hundred-handed Giants, they declared war on Saturn and the other Titans. Jupiter finally defeated the Titans and they were imprisoned in Tartarus. ===Dividing the universe=== Jupiter and his brothers divided the universe into three parts, Jupiter obtaining the heavens, Neptune the sea and Pluto the underworld. This is how Jupiter became the king of the gods. ==Related pages== * Tinia - Etruscan mythology equivalent to Jupiter * Zeus - Greek mythology equivalent to Jupiter * Odin - Norse mythology equivalent to Jupiter ==Notes== ==References== Category:Roman gods and goddesses Category:Gods and goddesses of the sky Category:Gods and goddesses of thunder
