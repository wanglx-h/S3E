It is made up of Member of Parliament election by the people. Sometimes it is called the 'lower house'. (The 'upper house' is called the House of Lords.) Other countries also have a bicameral parliament with a House of Commons working in the same way. In the British parliament, there are 650 Members of Parliament or Member of Parliament. Each MP represents a constituency, which covers an area of the country. The people of each constituency vote at a general election or a by-election to choose one person to represent them in the House of Commons. Usually, the people choose someone who belongs to a political party. When all the parties get together, the party or coalition with the most members is the government and runs the country. The leader of that party is called the Prime Minister. The House of Commons hold their meetings in the Palace of Westminster. Their chief officer is the Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom), who is elected by MPs. The current Speaker is Lindsay Hoyle, who was elected in 2019. The Clerk of the House of Commons is the Principal Adviser to the Speaker. The Serjeant-at-Arms is in charge of the security. == Election results since 1945 == {| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;font-size:90%;line-height:14px;" ! rowspan="2" |Year !
