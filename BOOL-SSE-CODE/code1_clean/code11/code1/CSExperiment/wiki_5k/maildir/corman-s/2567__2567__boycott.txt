Subject: Boycott
A '''boycott''' is a protest where the protesters do not buy a product (consumer goods) or give money to a company. Instead of buying a certain product, they might also buy another, very similar product from a different company. The word was made during the ''Irish Land War'''. It comes from the name of Captain Charles Boycott. Boycott was in charge of looking after the land of a landlord in County Mayo, Ireland. In 1880, the tenants (those who Renting) wanted their rent lowered. Boycott refused, and threw them out of the land they had rented. The Irish Land League then proposed that instead of becoming violence, everyone in the community should stop doing business with Captain Boycott. The captain was soon isolated. No one helped him with the harvest, no one worked in his stables or his house. Local businessmen no longer traded with him, the postman no longer delivered his post. To get his harvest done, he had to hire 50 people from other counties, the counties County Cavan and County Monaghan. They were escorted to and from their work by 1000 policemen. Of course, this cost far more than what the harvest was worth. ==Other websites== *[http://www.fuw.edu.pl/~pmh/boycott.html boycott resources] *[http://www.ethicalconsumer.org/boycotts/boycotts_list.htm List of boycotts at EthicalConsumer.org] Category:Economics Category:Protests
