Subject: List of endangered languages
A '''list of endangered languages''' (with fewer than 1000 speakers or with very fast decline). In order to judge if a language is actually endangered, the number of speakers is less important than the distribution among age cohorts. There may be 200,000 mother tongue speakers of the Breton language over 50 years of age, but fewer than 2,000 under 25 years of age - thus it is likely Breton will die out in the next half century. On the other hand, while there are 30,000 Ladin language speakers left, almost all children still learn it as their mother tongue - thus Ladin is not endangered in the 21st century. : ''This page should include a link to the language's page, geographical localization and an approximate number of speakers'' == Americas == * :en:Michif spoken by fewer than 1,000 people in western Canada * indigenous languages of Canada: ** Abenaki language, 10 speakers ** :en:Dane-zaa_language, 300 speakers ** :en:Cayuga_language, 360 speakers ** Delaware (Munsee language), fewer than 10 speakers ** Hare language, 600 speakers ** Onandaga language, fewer than 100 speakers ** :en:Oneida_language, 200 speakers ** :en:Potawatomi_language 100 speakers ** :en:Tsuutʼina_Nation, 10 speakers ** Seneca language, 25 speakers ** :en:Tlingit_language, 200 speakers * indigenous languages of the USA: ** Hawaiian language, Hawaii == Asia == * Ainu language, Northern Japan, 15 speakers * Aramaic language, Lebanon, Kurdistan * :en:Chukchi_language, Siberia, circa 10,400 speakers (2001) * :en:Udmurt_language, various parts of Russia * Siberians * Beechistani ,Somewhere in Northern India(Beechistaan), 6 speakers *Sanskrit, Nepal-India, Less than 500 speakers, According to Indian history, Sanskrit is the mother of all Indo-European languages. *:en:Athpare_language language, Athpahariya *:en:Bahing_language language, Bahing *:en:Baram_language language, Barām *:en:Chepang_language language *:en:Kumhali_language language, Kumāle *:en:Kusunda_language language, Kusunda *Surel language, Surel == Australia == * all :en:Australian_Aboriginal_languages == Europe == * European Union **Alsatian language (France) very fast decline ** Aragonese language (Spain) very fast decline ** Aromanian language (Greece) very fast decline ** Basque language (Spain and France) very fast decline ** Breton language (France) very fast decline ** Catalan language (France) very fast decline ** Corsican language (France) very fast decline ** Catalan language (Spain) very fast decline ** Greek language (Italy) very fast decline ** :en:Judeo-Italian_languages (Judeo-Italian) (Italy) nearly extinct ** :en:Slavomolisano_dialect (Italy) very fast decline ** Occitan language (France) very fast decline ** Sami languages, (Scandinavia), some having fewer than 100 speakers ** :en:Lower_Sorbian_language (Germany) very fast decline ** :en:West_Flemish (France) very fast decline ** :en:Yevanic_language (Judeo-Greek) (Greece) probably extinct * Outside of the European Union ** Belarusian language, very low usage in Belarus ** :en:Istro-Romanian_language, Istria Croatia, 500 speakers ** :en:Krymchak_language (Judeo-Crimean Tatar) ** Livonian language, Estonia, 35 speakers ** Mordvin (Russia), steady decline *** :en:Erzya_language *** :en:Moksha_language **Scottish Gaelic language (United Kingdom) very fast decline **:en:Votic_language, Russia, 50 speakers ==Related pages== * endangered language * :en:Lists_of_extinct_languages * Language families and languages * :en:Language_policy ==References== == Other websites == * [http://www.tooyoo.l.u-tokyo.ac.jp/Redbook/index.html UNESCO Red Book of Endangered Languages] Category:Language-related lists Category:Endangered languages
