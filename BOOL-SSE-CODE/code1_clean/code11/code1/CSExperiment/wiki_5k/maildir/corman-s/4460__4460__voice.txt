File:Izdisaj.jpg A '''voice''' is used when a person Speech or singer. It describes human communication, rather than that of animals. The sound of the voice is carried by the air, and can be heard. A vocal sound is made when air is passed over the vocal cords, so making a meaningful sound. If a person has no voice, the condition is called muteness. The musical part of a song that is sung by a person using their voice is called '''vocals'''. Many terrestrial animals make sounds, especially those that are vertebrates. By extension, this might be called their voice, but another term is "animal sounds". That includes a wider range of noises which animals may produce.
