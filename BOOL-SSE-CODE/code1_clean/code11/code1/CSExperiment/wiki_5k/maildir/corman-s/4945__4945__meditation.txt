File:Austria - Heiligenkreuz Abbey - 1707.jpg '''Meditation''' is a practice or exercise, where an individual trains one's attention and awareness to get to a clearer and calmer state. Scholars have found meditation difficult to define. The practices vary both between traditions and within them. Generally meditation tries to get past the "thinking" mind and aims to go into a deeper state of relaxation or awareness. It is a common practice in many religions including Buddhism, Christianity (sometimes), Taoism, Hinduism (where Yoga is important) and other religions. Meditation has now become a modern trend, showing many health benefits. The initial origin of meditation is from the Vedic times of India. == Buddhist meditation == In Buddhism, three things are very important: being a good person, making the mind stronger, and understanding (Insight or Wisdom) about why people are in pain (Dukkha).In Buddhism, these three things together are called the "threefold training." In the words of 2,000-year-old Buddhist books, these three things are called ''sīla'', ''citta'' (or ''samādhi'') and ''paññā''. See, for example, Thanissaro (1998a) and Thanissaro (1998b). For Buddhists, meditation is used to calm the mind so that the mind can better see the cause of pain. Buddhists believe that this type of seeing can end pain.See, for instance, Thanissaro (1998c). Buddhist meditation is not just used for Spirituality reasons. Research shows that Buddhist meditation lowers wikt:stress, anxiety and Depression (illness).Kabat-Zinn (1990); and, Linehan (1993), p. 1. Most types of Buddhist meditation focus on something. The most popular things to focus on include breath, metta, other recollections, situational mindfulness and religion images and sounds.See, for example, Kamalashila (2003). There were three inspiring methods that led to Buddhist meditation and they include the shamatha, which represents mindfulness, metta, or lovingkindness, and contemplative meditation. Shamatha is about setting the mind in the right place to prepare for the meditation. It's a technique to calm the mind and can help gain that needed peace, and awareness. The metta, now that the mind is set, is the step for loving. Loving yourself, pets, the people in one's life, even the enemies. The purpose is to feel this strong love for everyone, to have spiritual healings and embrace the kindness and good. Then for the final method, contemplative meditation, where the focus is on the mind and how to better the qualities of wisdom. It's a way to practice running through thoughts, acknowledging all the things that spin around one's head, rather than devoting time on social media. Every step is a guide to new openings, and peace. == Christian meditation == Christians sometimes meditate by thinking about small parts of the Bible, or by saying the words of a Prayer in Christianity to themselves over and over. Meditation is an expression of Christian prayer. In the Catechism of the Catholic Church is specified that by means of meditation "The mind seeks to understand the why and how of the Christian life, in order to adhere and respond to what the Lord is asking"; also it is pointed out that "meditation engages thought, imagination, emotion, and desire. This mobilization of faculties is necessary in order to deepen our convictions of faith, prompt the conversion of our heart, and strengthen our will to follow Christ". Meditation is principally made on the Sacred Scriptures with the Gospels, liturgical texts, writings of the spiritual fathers, and meditative devotions. Meditation is a significant part of the devotion of the Rosary; "by virtue of its meditative character, with the tranquil succession of Hail Marys, the Rosary has a peaceful effect on those who pray it, disposing them to receive and experience in their innermost depths, and to spread around them, that true peace which is the special gift of the Risen Lord (cf. Jn 14:27; 20.21)." == Hindu meditation == Meditation has a long tradition in Hinduism. It comes in many different styles. Here is a short list: * Transcendental Meditation * Yoga Meditation * Punishment * Fasting Meditation in Hinduism is used for different reasons. Some of the reasons are: * Deeper understanding of scriptural subjects * Evolvement of the soul * Cleaning the mind * To change the life situation of a person ==Related pages== * Hare Krishna * Inner peace * ''Zen'' * Yoga * Spirituality == Notes == == References == * * * * Thanissaro Bhikkhu (trans.)
