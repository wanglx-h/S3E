Jordan has borders with Syria to the north, Palestine (region) and Israel to the west, Iraq to the east, Saudi Arabia to the east and south, and the Gulf of Aqaba to the southwest, where the city of Aqaba is next to the Red Sea. The Capital (city) of Jordan is Amman. Aqaba is the only sea port for Jordan with only 27 kilometers of coastline. Jordan is named after Jordan River, which passes on its western borders. Jordan is a country that combines different Arab cultures and dialects. Natural borders that separate it from its Arab neighbors are the Jordan River, which separates Jordan and Israel as well as the Yarmouk River, which separates Jordan and Syria. As for the rest of the borders, it is an extension of the Levant Badia in the north and east, the Influence Desert in the south, and Wadi Araba to the southwest. The terrain in Jordan varies greatly, the most important of which are the Ajloun Mountains in the northwest, and the Shara Mountains in the south, the highest peak on Umm al-Dami Mountain is 1854 meters, and the lowest point in the Dead Sea, which is the lowest point in the world. In 1921, Prince Abdullah I of Jordan established the Emirate of Transjordan with the help of United Kingdom, and it was then subject to British rule in the British Mandate of Palestine. The system in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan is a constitutional monarchy with a representative government. The king exercises his executive power through the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers, who, at the same time, are accountable to the House of Representatives (Jordan) (elected) and the Senate (Jordan) (appointed by the king) who are the Legislature of the state. There is also an Judiciary system. Jordan is a founding member of the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. Jordan is a sovereign constitutional monarchy, yet the king enjoys extensive executive and legislative powers. Jordan is frequently referred to as an "oasis of stability" in a turbulent region, given that it was mostly unaffected by the violence that engulfed the region in 2010. However, the country's population suffers from relatively high rates of unemployment and poverty. ==Governorates== Jordan is divided into 12 Governorates. The governorates are divided into 54 departments or districts named Nahias. {| style="background:none; font-size:95%;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" |- valign="top" | {| class="wikitable" |- !

Most of them speak Arabic language as their first language. The population of Jordan is about 10.5 million people. Jordan is a constitutional monarchy and has a king. The King is the head of state, but he does not have all the power in the country. King Abdullah II of Jordan has been the King of Jordan since February 1999. Most Jordanians are Muslim. There are around 200-400,000 Christians. Jordan's national meal is mansaf. The most popular sport is Football (soccer). Jordanian culture respects womens privacy. Men do not shake hands with women unless the woman offers her hand. Taking photos of women without asking is not allowed. If you take photos of public areas or homes, make sure no women are in the picture without permission. == Economy == Unlike some of the countries around it, Jordan has little petroleum and natural gas. Some of its economy comes from mining instead. Jordan is the largest producer of the mineral phosphate in the world. Jordan is a Member of the OECD since 2019 as the first Arab Country to do so. The currency of Jordan is called the '''Jordanian dinar'''. ==Related pages== * Jordan at the Olympics * Jordan national football team * List of rivers of Jordan * Lama Hattab * Dima Hattab == References == ==Gallery== Gold district, Amman, Jordan2.jpg|Gold district in Amman Byzantine Church, Amman Citadel, Jordan1.jpg|Citadel in Amman Umayyad Qasr, Amman, Jordan5.jpg|Umayyad Qasr in Amman File:The Monastery, Petra, Jordan8.jpg Great Temple, Petra, Jordan7.jpg|Great Temple in Petra Nymphaeum, Jerash, Jordan2.jpg|Nymphaeum in Jerash Oval Forum, Jerash, Jordan2.jpg|Oval Forum in Jerash ==Other websites== Category:Jordan Category:Current monarchies Category:Members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation Category:1946 establishments in Asia
