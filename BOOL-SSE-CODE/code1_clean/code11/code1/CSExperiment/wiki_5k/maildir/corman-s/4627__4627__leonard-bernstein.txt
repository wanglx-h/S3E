His parents, Jennie and Samuel Bernstein, were Jewish immigrants from Rivne, in what used to be the Russian Empire, but is now Ukraine. When he was born, his grandmother wanted him to be named Louis, so that became his Legal name. However, his parents called him Leonard. When he was 16 years old, he legally changed his name from Louis to Leonard. Many people, including his friends, called him "Lenny." Bernstein’s mother gave birth to him while she was staying with her parents in Lawrence, Massachusetts. As a baby, he was not very healthy, so he stayed there until he became strong enough to join his father in Boston. Later, he attended Boston Latin School. When Bernstein was 15, his family moved to Newton, Massachusetts, which is close to Boston. Bernstein’s father owned the Samuel J. Bernstein Hair Company, which sold Machine for Perm (hairstyle) in the 1920s and 1930s. This business made the family wealthy. As a child, Bernstein’s only experience with music was listening to the radio and attending Friday night services at Congregation Mishkan Tefila (a Jewish synagogue) in Roxbury, Massachusetts. When Bernstein was 10, his aunt Clara gave her piano to the Bernsteins. Leonard was very interested and asked for piano Lesson.

Leonard also had a younger brother, Burton, who was born 13 years after him. Despite the age differences, the siblings were very close. Bernstein's father, Samuel, did not support Leonard’s interest in music at first. He refused to pay for piano lessons, so Leonard taught piano to neighborhood children to earn money. One of his students, Sid Ramin, became a lifelong friend and later worked with Bernstein to orchestrate ''West Side Story''.
