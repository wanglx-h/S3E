The name of this system can be shortened or abbreviation to '''SI''', from the French language name '''''S'''ystème '''I'''nternational d'unités''. The International System of Units is a system of measurement based on 7 base units: the metre (length), kilogram (mass), second (time), ampere (electric current), kelvin (temperature), mole (unit) (quantity), and candela (brightness). These base units can be used in combination with each other. This creates ''SI derived units'', which can be used to describe other quantities, such as volume, energy, pressure, and velocity. The system is used almost globally. Only Myanmar, Liberia, and the United States do not use SI as their official system of measurement. In these countries, though, SI is commonly used in science and medicine. == History and use == The metric system was created in France after the French Revolution in 1789. The original system only had two standard units, the kilogram and the metre. The metric system became popular amongst scientists. In the 1860s, James Clerk Maxwell and William Thomson (later known as Lord Kelvin) suggested a system with three base units length, mass, and time. Other units would be derived from those three base units. Later, this suggestion would be used to create the centimetre-gram-second system of units (CGS), which used the centimetre as the base unit for length, the gram as the base unit for mass, and the second as the base unit for time. It also added the dyne as the base unit for force and the erg as the base unit for energy. As scientists studied electricity and magnetism, they realized other base units were needed to describe these subjects. By the middle of the 20th century, many different versions of the metric system were being used. This was very confusing. In 1954, the 9th CGPM (CGPM) created the first version of the International System of Units. The six base units that they used were the metre, kilogram, second, ampere, Kelvin, and candela.. 9th session, Resolution 6. The seventh base unit, the mole, was added in 1971.. 14th session, Resolution 3. SI is now used almost everywhere in the world, except in the United States, Liberia and Myanmar, where the older imperial units are still widely used. Other countries, most of them historically related to the British Empire, are slowly replacing the old imperial system with the metric system or using both systems at the same time. == Units of measurement == === Base units === The SI '''base units''' are measurements used by scientists and other people around the world. All the other units can be written by combining these seven base units in different ways. These other units are called "derived units". {| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em 0" |+ SI base units [http://old.iupac.org/publications/books/author/mills.html Quantities Units and Symbols in Physical Chemistry], IUPAC |- !Unitname !Unitsymbol !Dimensional analysis !Physical quantity !DefinitionInterim definitions are given here only when there has been a ''significant'' difference in the definition. |- !second |style="text-align:center" |s |style="text-align:center" |T |time | * '''Prior''': \frac{1}{86400} of a day of 24hours of 60minutes of 60seconds * '''Interim''' (1956): \frac{1}{31556925.9747} of the tropical year for 1900 January 0 at 12hours ephemeris time. * '''Current''' (1967): The duration of periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two Hyperfine structure levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom. |- !metre |style="text-align:center" |m |style="text-align:center" |L |length | * '''Prior''' (1793): \frac{1}{10000000} of the Meridian (geography) through Paris between the North Pole and the Equator.FG * '''Interim''' (1960): wavelengths in a vacuum of the electromagnetic radiation corresponding to the transition between the 2p and 5d quantum levels of the krypton-86 atom. * '''Current''' (1983): The distance travelled by light in vacuum in \frac{1}{299792458} second. |- !kilogramDespite the prefix "kilo-", the kilogram is the coherent base unit of mass, and is used in the definitions of derived units.

The base units can be divided, multiplied, or raised to exponent. Some derived units have special names. Usually these were created to make calculations simpler. {| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em 0; text-align:center;" |+ style="font-size:larger;font-weight:bold;"|Named units derived from SI base units |- !

Prefixes are added to the beginning of the unit to make a new unit. For example, the prefix ''kilo-'' means "1000" times the original unit and the prefix ''milli-'' means "0.001" times the original unit. So one ''kilometre'' is 1000metres and one ''milligram'' is a 1000th of a gram. == References == Category:SI units Category:Systems
