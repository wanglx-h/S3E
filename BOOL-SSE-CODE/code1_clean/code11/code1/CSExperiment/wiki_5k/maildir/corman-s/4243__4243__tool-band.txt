Rolling Stone'' said it was one of the 100 best metal albums of all time. The band took a break before and after releasing their third album, ''Lateralus''. This was because singer Maynard James Keenan was working with his other band, A Perfect Circle. The band released their fourth album, ''10,000 Days (Tool album)'', on May 2, 2006, and their fifth album (''Fear Inoculum)'' on August 30, 2019. ==History== === Band starts === In 1989, James Maynard Keenan and guitarist Adam Jones met each other in Los Angeles. Keenan let Jones listen to music he had made with another band. Jones thought the music was good, and told Keenan they should make their own band. They started playing music together, while looking for other people to play the bass guitar and drums. Tom Morello introduced them to drummer Danny Carey, who lived in the building where they practiced. Carey joined the band because other drummers the band wanted to play with did not show up. Bassist Paul D'Amour was the last to join the band. After D'Amour and Carey joined, they named the band Tool. ===Opiate=== Tool made its first extended play in 1992. It was called ''Opiate (EP)''. To help sell copies of the EP, they went on tour. They went around the U.S. playing in concerts with two other bands named Fishbone and Rage Against the Machine. They also played in concerts with White Zombie and Corrosion of Conformity. In 1993, the band was playing at the Church of Scientology's Celebrity Centre in Los Angeles. Keenan (who would later write the lyrics "Fuck L. Ron Hubbard and fuck all his clones"), baa-ed like a sheep for most of the show. The EP did not sell many copies at first. After Tool got more popular, more people bought ''Opiate''. It took 13 years for the album to be RIAA certification by the RIAA (an award for selling one million copies). ===Undertow=== Tool's first studio album came out in 1993. It was called ''Undertow (Tool album)''. In 1994, the band released a single from the album named "Prison Sex (song)". With it was a music video that was created and directed by Jones. The video was deemed "too graphic and offensive",(October 8, 2006). "[http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2006/10/08/mag01.asp Tool] ". ''SundayObserver.ik''.

It was certified gold by the RIAA after only eight months, and platinum less than a year later.(June 7, 2002). "[http://toolshed.down.net/news/tales/platinum.html Gold/platinum certifications]".

Tool began a long legal fight with their label Volcano Records (formerly Zoo Records) over problems with their contract. They ended up with a new contract that said they would make three more albums. The members of Tool decided to take some time away after that. The album was certified gold in 10 weeks and achieved double platinum, which means it sold two million copies, in 10 months. In 1998, "Ænema" won the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance. '''Fear Inoculum''' On January 26, 2020, Tool won Best Metal Performance at the 62nd Grammy Award for "7empest". Band members Justin Chancellor and Danny Carey went to the awards show to accept the award. ==Style== Singer Maynard James Keenan has a unique, melodic style of singing. This style is thought to have influenced many other bands. While guitarist Adam Jones's style of playing is very simple, he is known for his use of different techniques of playing together, and trying new things with his instrument. Danny Carey has a very technical, advanced style of drumming. He is known for using odd Time signature, among other things. Justin Chancellor has an aggressive style of picking and fingering, using many guitar techniques which include using a pick, chords, harmonics, effects, and hammer ons and pull offs. ==Discography== ;Studio albums * ''Undertow (Tool album)'' (1993) * ''Ænima'' (1996) * ''Lateralus'' (2001) * ''10,000 Days (Tool album)'' (2006) * ''Fear Inoculum'' (2019) ;Other releases * ''Opiate'' (1992, EP) * ''Salival'' (2000, live, also includes a VHS/DVD) * ''Schism/Parabola''(2006, music videos on DVDs) ==References== ==Other websites== * [http://toolband.com Toolband.com] - official website * [http://toolarmy.com ToolArmy.com: The Collective Unconscious] - official fanclub * [http://toolshed.down.net The Tool Page (t.d.n)] - "semi-official" website Category:1990 establishments in the United States Category:1990s American music groups Category:2000s American music groups Category:2010s American music groups Category:American heavy metal bands Category:Progressive rock bands Category:American Grammy Award winners Category:Musical groups established in 1990 Category:Musical groups from Los Angeles Category:Progressive metal bands Category:Tool (band)
