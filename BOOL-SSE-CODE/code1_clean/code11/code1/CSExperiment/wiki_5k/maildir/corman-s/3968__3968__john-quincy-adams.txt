He served as the 6th president of the United States from 1825 to 1829. Before becoming president, he served as the eighth United States Secretary of State from 1817 to 1825. He was the eldest son of John Adams, the 2nd president of the United States from 1797 to 1801 and First Lady Abigail Adams. Adams was a Federalist Party and later a Democratic-Republican Party and served in the administrations of all the presidents that were before him. He was the eighth United States Secretary of State under James Monroe, who was president before Adams. He began his service when he was just 27 in 1794 when he was named United States Minister to the Netherlands by President George Washington. Adams led the fight against slavery in Congress. In 1838, at age 71, he spoke for the African slaves of the slave ship ''Amistad''. He won the case. He also said that the Gag Rule in Congress (which banned all petitions against slavery from being heard in Congress) was illegal and saw through its removal in 1844 after an eight-year struggle against it. == Early life == He was born on July 11, 1767 in Braintree, Massachusetts. As a child he watched the Battle of Bunker Hill, a fight of the American Revolutionary War, from his family's farm. When his father, John Adams, traveled to Europe, John Quincy went with him as his secretary. He became good at speaking other languages. Aside from English, he was also fluent in Latin and French, and had partial knowledge of Dutch, German, Greek, Italian, Spanish, and Russian. == Education == He went to Harvard University College and became a lawyer. At age 26, he was appointed Minister to the Netherlands and then he went to Berlin. In 1802, he was elected to the United States Senate. Six years later, President James Madison appointed him as Minister to Russia. As Secretary of State when James Monroe was president, Adams organized joint control of Oregon with the United Kingdom and helped get Florida from Spain. He also helped make the Monroe Doctrine. == Presidency == Adams was elected president by the United States House of Representatives after the 1824 United States presidential election gave nobody a majority of electoral votes. People who wanted Andrew Jackson to win said there was a deal between Adams and Speaker of the House Henry Clay; Adams had made Clay his Secretary of State. This was called the "corrupt bargain". Adams passed a law for U.S. improvements as part of what he called the "American System." This means he created roads, canals, and used high tariffs, or taxes on foreign goods. Among his proposals were the creation of a national university,The National University School of Law was not established until 1869 a naval academy,Not established until 1845 during the Polk Administration and a national astronomical observatory.A Bill for Observatory was signed by President Adams in 1825; the United States Naval Observatory was formerly established in 1830 Adams fought Congress many times as many supporters of Andrew Jackson did not like his support of a national bank and tariffs. Criticism of Adams peaked when Adams passed the Tariff of 1828, also known as the "Tariff of Abominations" by opponents. Adams lost the 1828 election to Jackson. The election was noted for the personal attacks made by the candidates against each other. File:John Quincy Adams MET DT1666.jpg == Abolitionist == In the 1830s, slavery emerged as an increasingly polarizing issue in the United States. A longtime opponent of slavery, Adams used his new role in Congress to fight it, and he became the most prominent national leader opposing slavery. After one of his reelection victories, he said that he must "bring about a day prophesied when slavery and war shall be banished from the face of the earth." He wrote in his private journal in 1820:''The discussion of this Missouri question has betrayed the secret of their souls. In the abstract they admit that slavery is an evil, they disclaim it, and cast it all upon the shoulder of…Great Britain. But when probed to the quick upon it, they show at the bottom of their souls pride and vainglory in their condition of masterdom. They look down upon the simplicity of a Yankee's manners, because he has no habits of overbearing like theirs and cannot treat negroes like dogs. It is among the evils of slavery that it taints the very sources of moral principle. It establishes false estimates of virtue and vice: for what can be more false and heartless than this doctrine which makes the first and holiest rights of humanity to depend upon the color of the skin?''In 1836, partially in response to Adams's consistent presentation of citizen petitions requesting the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia, the House of Representatives imposed a "gag rule" that immediately tabled any petitions about slavery. The rule was favored by Democrats and Southern Whigs but was largely opposed by Northern Whig Party (United States) like Adams. In late 1836, Adams began a campaign to ridicule slave owners and the gag rule. He frequently attempted to present anti-slavery petitions, often in ways that provoked strong reactions from Southern representatives. Though the gag rule remained in place, the discussion ignited by his actions and the attempts of others to quiet him raised questions of the right to petition, the right to legislative debate, and the morality of slavery. Adams fought actively against the gag rule for another seven years, eventually moving the resolution that led to its repeal in 1844. In 1841, at the request of Lewis Tappan and Ellis Gray Loring, Adams joined the case of ''United States v. The Amistad''. Adams went before the Supreme Court on behalf of African slaves who had revolted and seized the Spanish ship ''Amistad''. Adams arrived on February 24, 1841, and the 73-year-old former president spoke for four hours. His argument succeeded; the Court ruled in favor of the Africans, who were declared free and returned to their homes. == Later life == Adams returned to Massachusetts for a short time after he lost. He returned to Washington D.C. in 1831 after being elected to the United States House of Representatives. He was a leading opponent of '''slavery.''' He remained in Congress until the day of his death on February 23, 1848. == Death == File:John Quincy Adams drawing2.jpgOn February 21, 1848, Adams suffered a stroke in the House chamber. He collapsed and died in the House two days later on February 23, 1848. He was eighty years old. It was the 6th death of a US president. Due to the importance of Adams, especially in his later years, it was arguably one of the most significant presidential deaths up to that point. == Legacy == Adams is known today as someone who was a good diplomat, Secretary of State and Congressman. It is argued that he was one of the best, if not the best Secretaries of State in history. However, his presidency was at best average. However, this was likely due to Andrew Jackson's opponents in Congress limiting what he could do, leading to Adams not being able to get some things done. == References == Category:1767 births Category:1848 deaths Category:Deaths from stroke Category:John Quincy Adams Category:Presidents of the United States Category:Deans of the United States House of Representatives Category:United States Secretaries of State Category:Children of Presidents of the United States Category:United States senators from Massachusetts Category:United States representatives from Massachusetts Category:Ambassadors of the United States to Russia Category:Federalist Party politicians Category:Democratic-Republican Party politicians Category:National Republican Party politicians Category:Whig Party (United States) politicians Category:19th-century American politicians Category:Ambassadors to the United Kingdom Category:Ambassadors of the United States to the Netherlands Category:19th-century presidents of the United States
