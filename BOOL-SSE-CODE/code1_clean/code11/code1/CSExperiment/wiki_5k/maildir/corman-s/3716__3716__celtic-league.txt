The '''Celtic League''' is a group of people from the six modern Celts nations: Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Brittany, Cornwall and the Isle of Man. Its members want their countries to be free. All six countries have a native Celtic language, and the Celtic League supports learning of them. The six Celtic languages are Irish language, Scottish Gaelic language, Welsh language, Breton language, Cornish language and Manx language. == Related pages == *Pan-Celticism == References == * Ellis, Peter Berresford ''The Celtic Dawn'' * Tanner, Marcus ''Last of the Celts'' == Other websites == * [http://www.manxman.co.im/cleague/ Celtic League Website] * [http://www.celticleague.org/ Celtic League, American branch] * [http://homepages.enterprise.net/mlockerby/ Celtic League, International Site] * [http://alba-branch.tripod.com/ Celtic League, Scottish Branch] Category:Celtic languages Category:Celtic peoples
