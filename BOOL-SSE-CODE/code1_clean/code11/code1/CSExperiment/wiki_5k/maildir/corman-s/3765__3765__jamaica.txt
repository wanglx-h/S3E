The island, in area, lies about south of Cuba, and west of Hispaniola. Its capital city is Kingston; other towns include Montego Bay, St. Ann's Bay and Spanish Town. The island is divided into three counties – Cornwall, Middlesex and Surrey – which are subdivided into 14 parishes: Kingston, St. Andrew, St. Catherine, Clarendon, Manchester, St. Elizabeth, Westmoreland, Hanover, St. James, Trelawny, St. Ann, St. Mary, Portland and St. Thomas. Jamaica is the third-largest island country in the Greater Antilles. Its Taíno name is ''Xaymaca'', meaning "Land of Springs". Jamaica is part of the West Indies. ==History of Jamaica == The Taíno indigenous people, originating in South America, settled on the island between 4000 and 1000BC. When Christopher Columbus arrived in 1494, there were more than 200 villages ruled by ''caciques'' (chiefs of villages). The south coast of Jamaica was the most populated, especially around the area now known as Old Harbour. Christopher Columbus, during his second voyage to the Americas, claimed Jamaica for Spain after landing there on 5 May 1494 and his probable landing point was Dry Harbour, now called Discovery Bay, Jamaica. There is some debate as to whether he landed in St. Ann's Bay or in Discovery Bay. Saint Ann Parish, Jamaica was named "Saint Gloria" by Columbus, as the first sighting of the land. In 1503, during his fourth voyage, Columbus had to spend one year on the northern coast of the island, and he named the island ''Isla de Santiago'' (by James (son of Zebedee), in Spanish ''Santiago''). In 1509, the new Governor of the Hispaniola, Diego Columbus, sent Juan de Esquivel, a Conquistador born in Seville, Spain, with 70 men to Jamaica to complete the conquest of that island. They first lived in the St. Ann's Bay area and soon Esquivel founded a town, ''Sevilla La Nueva'' (in English, "The New Seville") on the north coast, one mile to the west of St. Ann's Bay. Sevilla was abandoned around 1524 because it was deemed unhealthy. The capital was moved to Spanish Town, then called ''Saint Jago de la Vega'', in the south around 1534. ===British rule=== In 1654 Oliver Cromwell decided to break the Spanish control of the West Indies and he sent a Naval fleet in an expedition) led by William Penn (Admiral) and General Robert Venables. The fleet arrived to the Hispaniola island on 13 April 1655 but the British lost in two battles on 17 and 25 April and they decided to move to Jamaica.William Penn: [http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&staticfile=show.php&title=1986&layout=html#chapter_127751 ''Narrative of the Expedition to San Domingo''] . On 10 May 1655, Penn and Venables led a successful attack on Jamaica. The Spanish surrendered to the English, freed their slaves and then fled to Cuba. It was this set of freed slaves and their descendants living in the Jamaican mountains who became known as the Maroon (people). ===Independence=== After a long period of direct British colonial rule, Jamaica gained a degree of local political control in the late 1930s, and held its first election under full universal adult suffrage in 1944. Jamaica joined nine other U.K. territories in the West Indies Federation in 1958 but withdrew after Jamaican voters rejected membership in 1961. Jamaica got its independence in 1962, remaining a member of the Commonwealth. ==Government and politics== File:Parliament.jm.jpg]] Jamaica is a parliamentary system and constitutional monarchy, with King Charles III serving as the monarch. However, as Charles III is shared as head of state of fifteen other countries (the Commonwealth realm) in addition to the UK and resides mostly in the United Kingdom, he is thus often represented as King of Jamaica in Jamaica and abroad by the Governor of Jamaica. The governor-general is nominated by the Prime Minister of Jamaica and appointed by the monarch. All the members of the Cabinet are appointed by the governor-general on the advice of the prime minister. The monarch and the governor-general serve largely Ceremony roles. The Parliament of Jamaica is bicameral. This means that it consists of two Houses, the Senate, also called the Upper House, and the House of Representatives, also known as the Lower House. The members of the House (known as Members of Parliament or ''MPs'') are Election by the people of Jamaica. The leader of the political party with most members in the House of Representatives is appointed by the governor-general to be the prime minister. Senators are nominated jointly by the prime minister and the parliamentary leader of the opposition and are then appointed by the governor-general. Tarch 2016. Prime Minister Holness acts as head of government of Jamaica. Jamaica has traditionally had a system of two Political party, with power often alternating between the People's National Party and Jamaica Labour Party (JLP). The party with current administrative and legislative power is Jamaica Labour Party, with a two-thirds Parliamentary majority as of 2016. ===Parishes=== Jamaica is divided into 14 parishes, which are grouped into three historic county that have no administrative relevance.
