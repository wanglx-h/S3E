In other parts of the world, Tuesday is the second day of the week. == History of the name == The name ''Tuesday'' comes from a Middle English word, ''Tiwesday''. This word came from the Old English language word ''Tiwes dæg''. This was named after the Norse mythology god List of Norse gods and goddesses. Tyr was the God of War, like the Roman war god Mars (mythology), and Greek god Ares. In Latin, ''Tuesday'' is called ''Martis dies'' which means "Mars's Day". In French, Spanish, Italian and Romanian, the (Romance languages), the word for "Tuesday" is nearly the same as the Latin name. Tuesday is ''mardi'' in French language, ''martes'' in Spanish language, ''martedì'' in Italian language, ''dimarts'' in Catalan language, and ''marţi'' in Romanian language. The Celtic languages still spoken use the Latin names,[http://www.ceantar.org/Dicts/MB2/mb13.html MacBain, Alexander. An Etymological Dictionary of the Gaelic Language.
