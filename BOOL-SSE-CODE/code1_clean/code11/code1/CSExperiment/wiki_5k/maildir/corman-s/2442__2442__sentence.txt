A '''sentence''' is a group of words that are joined together to mean something. It is the basic unit of language and expresses a complete thought. It does so by following the grammar basic rules of syntax: ''Ram is walking''. A complete sentence has at least a '''Subject (grammar)''' and a '''main verb''' to state (declare) a complete thought: ''She walks''. A subject is the noun (name) that does the main verb. The main verb is the activity that the subject does. In English language and many other languages, the first word of a written sentence has a Capitalization. At the end of the sentence there is a punctuation mark depending on whether it is a statement, a question, a command, a request or an exclamation. == Phrases and clauses == A ''phrase'' or ''clause'' is part of a sentence.McArthur, Tom (ed) 1992. ''The Oxford companion to the English language''. Oxford University Press.p773–777 This is an example of a sentence: * ''The dog is happy.'' In this sentence, ''The dog'' is the subject, and ''is'' is the verb. This is an example of a phrase: * ''The happy dog'' There is no verb and so we do not know anything about what the happy dog is doing. Therefore, it is not a sentence. A clause is a sentence within a sentence: * ''They milked the cows, and then they made cheese and butter''. This sentence has two co-ordinate (equal) clauses, linked by ''and''.p220 ==Types of sentence== * A '''simple sentence''' has only one clause and one independent variable: ''The cat is sleeping''. * A '''compound sentence''' has two or more clauses, which are joined with conjunctions, punctuation, or both: ''The dog is happy, but the cat is sad''. * A '''complex sentence''' has one clause with a relative clause: ''The dog, which is eating the bone, is happy''. * A '''complex-compound sentence''' (or compound-complex sentence) has many clauses, at least one of which is a relative clause: ''The dog, which is eating the bone, is happy, but the cat is sad''. Sentences have different purposes: * A '''declarative sentence''', or declaration, is the most common type of sentence. It tells something. It ends with a full stop '''.''' (''The dog is happy''.) * An '''interrogative sentence''', or question, asks something. It ends with a question mark '''?''' (''Are you happy?'') * An '''exclamatory sentence''', or exclamation, says something out of the ordinary. It ends with an exclamation mark '''!''' (''That dog is the happiest dog I have ever seen!'') * An '''imperative sentence''', or command, tells someone to do something. It ends with a full stop '''.''' (''Give the dog a bone.'') == Basic English sentences == Here are some sentences written in Basic English: The sky is blue. Today is Monday. Tomorrow is Tuesday. The baby is smiling. Sheila is reading a book. This is the road to take. Read a book about the history of America. There are beautiful flowers growing in the garden. The cushions are new and I feel the comfort they give me. They are playing in the grounds. ==Related pages== * Phrase * Punctuation * Word == References == ==Other websites== *[https://englishnotesguru.com/types-of-sentences-worksheet/ TYpes of sentences worksheet] Category:Sentences
