A '''stapler''' is an office tool that is used to place thin items such as paper together. It uses a small piece of wire (a staple (fastener)) to put them together. The ends of the staple are pointed and go into the paper. File:2017 Zszywacz biurowy.jpg There is also a chain store of stores called ''Staples'', which sells office supply. When you press the stapler down, it will release a staple. The staple is pressed into the paper, and then bent. That way the pieces of paper get stuck together.
