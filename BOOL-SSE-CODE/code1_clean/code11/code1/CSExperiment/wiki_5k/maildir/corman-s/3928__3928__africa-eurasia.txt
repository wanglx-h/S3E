File:LocationAfricaEurasia.png '''Africa-Eurasia''' (also called '''Afro-Eurasia''', '''Eurafrasia''', '''Afrasia''' and the Old World) is the world's biggest landmass. Around 85% (approximately 5.5 billion) of the world population lives there. It is split between the two continents of Africa and Eurasia, the latter of which has been historically further subdivided into Asia and Europe. In geopolitics, the mainland of Africa-Eurasia (excluding islands such as the British Isles, Japan, Madagascar, and the Malay Archipelago) has been referred to as '''World Island'''. The Old World includes Africa-Eurasia and its surrounding islands: * Africa ** North Africa ** Sub-Saharan Africa *** East Africa *** Central Africa *** Southern Africa *** West Africa * Eurasia ** Asia *** Central Asia *** East Asia *** Siberia *** Southeast Asia *** South Asia *** Western Asia ** Europe *** Eastern Europe *** Northern Europe *** Southern Europe *** Western Europe In geology terms, Africa-Eurasia (or Eurafrasia) may be a supercontinent if Africa collides with Europe. One estimate suggests it will happen in 600,000 years, when the southern tip of Spain reaches Africa. If this happens, the Mediterranean Sea will be isolated from the Atlantic Ocean. Africa is expected to collide with Europe completely in 50 million years, closing the Mediterranean.[http://www.scotese.com/future.htm Africa will collide Europe and Asia, 50 Million years from now] == References == Category:Supercontinents
