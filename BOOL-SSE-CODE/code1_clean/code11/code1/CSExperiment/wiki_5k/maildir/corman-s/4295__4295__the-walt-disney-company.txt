Disney is known for Mickey Mouse, Winnie the Pooh, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 movie), Cinderella (1950 movie), The Little Mermaid (1989 movie), The Lion King, Mary Poppins (movie), Aladdin (1992 movie), Frozen (2013 movie), Tarzan (1999 movie), Lilo & Stitch, Beauty and the Beast (1991 movie), Tangled and Pinocchio (1940 movie).
