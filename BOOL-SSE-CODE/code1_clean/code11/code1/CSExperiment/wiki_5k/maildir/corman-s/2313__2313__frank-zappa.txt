He was known for his strange style of music, which was often weird and funny. He made various types of music and many albums. Zappa worked with many other musicans, most notably his 1960s group The Mothers of Invention and his friend and Blues music singer Captain Beefheart. Some people think he is the best composer in popular music or even any non-classical music. Zappa was born in Baltimore, Maryland, but spent most of his life in Southern California. He grew up in Baltimore, in Florida, and in Monterey, California, Claremont, California and El Cajon, California. His mother was of France and Italy descent; his father was an immigrant from Sicily. Zappa had four children with his wife Gail. They gave them all very unusual names: Moon Unit Zappa, Dweezil Zappa, Ahmet Zappa, and Diva. Zappa was openly against Illegal drugs, Televangelism, and censorship music. He often tried to see what he could get away with. Zappa died from prostate cancer in Los Angeles, California. == Other websites == *[http://www.zappa.com/ Zappa.com] *[http://www.zappanale.de Zappanale] * ==Notes== Category:Actors from Baltimore Category:Actors from California Category:Actors from Florida Category:20th-century American musicians Category:American jazz musicians Category:American rock guitarists Category:American songwriters Category:American television actors Category:Cancer deaths in Los Angeles Category:Deaths from prostate cancer Category:Multi-instrumentalists Category:Musicians from California Category:Musicians from Florida Category:Musicians from Maryland Category:1940 births Category:1993 deaths
