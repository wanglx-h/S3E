| death_place =Tenochtitlan }} '''Moctezuma II''', also known as '''Motecuhzoma Xocoyotzin''' (1466-1520) and often called '''Montezuma''' in English language, was the Aztecs emperor (''tlahtoani'') from 1502 to 1520. His name comes from the Nahuatl word ''Motecuhzoma'', which means "he who is leader because of his Rage (emotion)". In Spanish language, he is called Moctezuma. == Arrival of Cortés == Hernán Cortés, a Spanish Empire conquistador, arrived in Mesoamerica in 1519 and Invasion the Aztec Empire. Instead of seeing Cortés as a threat, Moctezuma thought Cortés was the Deity Quetzalcoatl and did not fight back. The Spanish took control of the empire's Capital (city), Tenochtitlan, in 1520. Cortés took Moctezuma prisoner. When the Aztec people resisted, Cortés told Moctezuma to calm them down. While doing that, Moctezuma was killed. === Death === Historians do not know exactly how Moctezuma died. The Spaniards said he was killed by Aztec people who threw rocks at him. Meanwhile, the Aztecs said Cortés killed Moctezuma. They said they found Moctezuma's body in the streets with many sword wounds after the Spanish left. == Other websites == *A reconstructed [http://www.reportret.info/gallery/motecuhzoma1.html portrait of Motecuhzoma Xocoyotzin], based on historical sources, in a contemporary style.
