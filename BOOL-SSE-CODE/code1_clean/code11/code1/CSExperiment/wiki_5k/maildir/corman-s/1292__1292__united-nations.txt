It was founded to replace the League of Nations following World War II and to prevent another conflict. When it was founded, the UN had 51 members. Now there are 193. Most nations are members of the UN and send Diplomacy to the headquarters to hold meetings and make decisions about global issues. The goals of the United Nations are: * To keep world peace. * To help countries cooperate. *To reduce poverty amongst its members * To right to an adequate standard of living for people all over the world. * To make the world a better place. == History == After World War I, the nations of the world formed the League of Nations. The organization was a place where nations could talk through their differences calmly. However, some countries like Germany, Italy, and Japan ignored the League. They tried to solve their problems through war. Members of the League of Nations did not want to go to war to protect other members and so it failed. World War II soon started. The Allies of World War II often called themselves "the United Nations" since they were united against the Axis Powers. After the war, the winners formed a new organization for world peace. On 25 April 1945 in San Francisco, they decided on the name '"United Nations". In June, they signed the United Nations Charter and decided how the organization would work. The UN was created on 24 October 1945, and its first meeting was held in January 1946. Since 1947 24 October has been called “United Nations Day”. The only country whose flag is modeled after the United Nations is Somalia.Tittemore, Brian D. "Belligerents in blue helmets: applying international humanitarian law to United Nations peace operations." Stan. J. Int'l L. 33 (1997): 61. == Headquarters == The United Nations is based in New York City, United States, except for the International Court of Justice, which is in The Hague, Netherlands. The leader of the United Nations is called United Nations Secretary-General. ==Activity== The UN's main buildings are in New York City. The UN also has offices in Geneva, Switzerland, Kenya, and Austria. The UN tries to be peaceful but it has been involved in armed conflicts. In the 1950s during the Soviet Union boycott of United Nations Security Council, the UN supported Korean War. In the 1990s, the UN helped to force Gulf War. At other times, the UN has built peacekeeping forces. They travel to conflicted places in the world to keep the peace. In the 2020s there have been UN peacekeepers working in Cyprus, Lebanon, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Central African Republic, Pakistan, and several other countries. Through a series of goals, resolutions and declarations the United Nations has a set of commitments, actions, and goals to stop and reverse the spread of HIV and scale up towards universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care, and support services. Some of the UN's main work involves the Sustainable Development Goals. These goals, sometimes called the Global Goals, were adopted by the General Assembly in 2015. These 17 goals are based around ending poverty and hunger, making people more equal, and taking action to stop climate change. UN agencies such as UNHCR, WFP, UNICEF, IOM and others are essential in delivering humanitarian assistance. == Divisions == The United Nations has six "principal organs": '''Principal organs of the United Nations''' :wikisource:Charter of the United Nations - :wikisource:Charter_of_the_United_Nations#Chapter_III_-_Organs (''Organs'') {| cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" style="background:#E0E0E0; width:100%" |- style="text-align:center" | width=34% style="padding-left:15px; padding-top:10px" | '''United Nations General Assembly'''- Deliberative assembly of all Member states of the United Nations (each country has one vote) | rowspan="7" style="background:white" | | width="34%" style="padding-left:15px; padding-top:10px" | '''United Nations Secretariat'''- Administrative organ of the UN | rowspan="7" style="background:white" | | width=34% style="padding-left:15px; padding-top:10px" | '''International Court of Justice'''- Universal court for international law (based in The Hague) |- style="text-align: center" | File:UN General Assembly hall.jpg | File:UN HQ 157652121 5b5979da9e2.jpg | File:International Court of Justice HQ 2006.jpg |- | valign="top" style="padding-left:15px; padding-bottom:10px"| * may resolve non-compulsory recommendations to states, or suggestions to the United Nations Security Council * decides on the admission of new members, after a proposal of the Security Council * adopts the budget * elects the non-permanent members of the Security Council and all of the members of Economic and Social Council, after a proposal of the Security Council, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, and the 15 judges of the International Court of Justice. | valign="top" style="padding-left:15px; padding-bottom:10px" | * supports the other UN bodies administratively, such as in the organization of conferences, in the writing of reports and studies, and in the preparation of the budget plan * chairman, the UN Secretary General, is elected by the United Nations General Assembly for a five-year mandate and is the most important representative of the UN. * besides its headquarters in New York City, has three main offices in Geneva, Nairobi ,and Vienna | valign="top" style="padding-left:15px; padding-bottom:10px" | * decides disputes between states that recognize its jurisdiction and creates legal opinions * has 15 judges are elected by the General Assembly for nine years.

They are independent of the UN secretariat, with their own budgets and memberships. Some of them are older than the United Nations. Here are a few of them: * The World Health Organization (WHO) * The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) * The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) * The International Labour Organization (ILO) * The International Monetary Fund (IMF) * The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) The United Nations also has funds and programmes. Unlike specialized agencies, these are reliant on voluntary contributions, or money that countries can choose whether or not to give to. * The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) * The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) * The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) * The World Food Programme (WFP) * The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) ==Related pages== * Members of the United Nations ==References== '''Notes''' ==Other websites== *[http://www.un.org UN website] *[http://www.unfoundation.org UN Foundation website] Category:United Nations Category:1945 establishments
