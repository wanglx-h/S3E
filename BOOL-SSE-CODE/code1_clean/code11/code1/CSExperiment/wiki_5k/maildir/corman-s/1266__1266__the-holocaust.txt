'''The Holocaust''' * * ()|group=lower-alpha}} was the genocide of Jew in Europe by Nazi Germany, other Axis powers and their local collaborators in occupied territories between 1933 and 1945. * * * Peter Hayes: ''Warum? Eine Geschichte des Holocaust.'' Campus, Frankfurt am Main 2017, ISBN 978-3-593-50745-3, S. 11 At least 6,000,000 Jews (67% pre-war Ashkenazi Jews) were killed. ==Overview== The Nazis called themselves ''Übermensch'' ("master race") and wanted to Final Solution. Definition, Holocaust, & Third Reich Britannica|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Final-Solution|access-date=2024-10-18|website=Britannica|language=en}} In an organized, planned and deliberate way, they murdered around six million Jews and five million others who were not part of the "master race". The Nazis Persecution Jews and other groups in many ways. They forced many Jews to live in Ghettos in Europe during the Holocaust. They Deportation millions of people to forced labor camps and Nazi concentration camp. To allow them to kill as quickly as possible, they built Extermination camp with Gas chamber that could kill up to 2,000 people at a time. ===European Jewry=== In 1933, around 9,500,000 Jewish people lived in Europe. (This was less than 2% of Europe's total population.) By 1945, nearly two out of every three Jews in Europe had been killed in the Holocaust. Every Jewish community in Nazi-Occupied territory Europe lost people during the Holocaust. ==Background== ===Definition=== According to the ''Holocaust Encyclopedia'', According to the Yad Vashem, According to the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust, According to the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA), ===Etymology=== The word ''holocaust'' originally Description a Sacrifice where Animal were burned to Ash. At some point during the late 19th century, it also came to mean "Massacre Genocide of a group of Mankind". For instance, some people described the Armenian Genocide as a ''holocaust'' when it happened. After World War II, the Nazis' genocide against the Jews became widely known as "the Holocaust." Britannica|url=https://www.britannica.com/story/what-is-the-origin-of-the-term-holocaust|access-date=2025-03-25|website=www.britannica.com|language=en}} This name was chosen to reflect how the bodies of Nazi concentration camp victims were Cremation in fires or Cremation. Today, mainstream Academia say it is offensive to use the word ''holocaust'' to describe something other than the World War II-era Holocaust.[http://www.bnaibrith.ca/publications/audit2000/audit2000-03.html "Antisemitism and Hate in Canada"]. League for Human Rights of Canada. March 2000. . Retrieved 2 December 2020. Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel said that the word had become too trivialized. He pointed out examples of news networks using the word to describe a small-scale murder case or the defeat of a sports team.Cohen, Asher; Gelber, Joav; Wardi, Charlotte, eds. (1988).

The largest of these was the Warsaw Ghetto. In November 1940, the Nazis forced 380,000 Jews into the ghetto and locked them in. Over 80,000 of them died from starvation, overcrowding, disease, Hypothermia, and other terrible conditions. The second largest, the Łódź Ghetto, held around 210,000 people in total. In this ghetto, more than one in every five people died from the terrible living conditions. According to Leo Schneiderman, who survived the Lodz Ghetto: "The whole ghetto was designed, actually, to starve the people out." ===Concentration camps=== File:Prisoners liberation dachau.jpg cheer the United States Army as they free the camp.]] There were 23 main concentration camps and hundreds of sub-camps throughout the lands that Nazi Germany controlled. According to Karin Orth in the ''Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos: 1933-1945'', as many as one thousand camps may have operated at a time. The Nazis used concentration camps for many purposes: to gather and isolate the Nazis' "enemies"; to punish and torture these "enemies"; to obtain forced labor; to steal victims' belongings on a massive scale; to perform medical experiments on prisoners; and to kill people. Major concentration camps included: * '''Auschwitz concentration camp''' * Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where Anne Frank was killed * Buchenwald concentration camp * Dachau concentration camp, the first Nazi concentration camp * Mauthausen concentration camp * Ravensbrück concentration camp, a camp for female prisoners * Sachsenhausen concentration camp ===Death camps=== File:2013 KL Majdanek Baths and Gas Chamber - 30.jpg The Nazis established six death camps in Poland. Their sole purpose was to kill Jews as quickly and wikt:efficient as possible.The death camps were: * '''Auschwitz concentration camp''' * Bełżec extermination camp * Chełmno extermination camp * Majdanek concentration camp * Sobibor extermination camp * Treblinka extermination camp ==Methods== ===Mass murder=== Special Schutzstaffel units like the ''Einsatzgruppen'' killed hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of Jews at a time in mass shootings. Sometimes they forced Jews and other prisoners to dig giant holes in the ground where, after days of hard work, they were shot. Their bodies were buried and burned in mass graves. File:Men with an unidentified unit execute a group of Soviet civilians kneeling by the side of a mass grave.jpg'' execute a group of Soviet Union Civilian kneeling by the side of a mass grave.]] At Babi Yar in Kyiv ''Einsatzgruppen'' killed 33,771 Jews in two days, between 29-30 September 1941. The Nazis continued to use Babi Yar for mass Execution of Jews, Red Army Prisoner of war, and Roma people throughout the war.

Definition and History Britannica|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/T4-Program|access-date=2024-10-14|website=Britannica|language=en}} The Nazis believed in Nazi eugenics and thought that Disability, chronically ill people, and many Old age were Ableism To eliminate these people, the Nazis sent them to killing centers like Hartheim Killing Facility, where they murdered them in gas chambers. According to the ''Britannica'', When they first used poison gas to kill Jews, the Nazis used gas Van that piped Carbon monoxide poisoning into the passenger compartment. Soon, though, the Nazis built permanent gas chambers where they killed up to 2000 people at a time. By 1942 the Nazi's main method of murdering people in concentration camps was to kill them in gas chambers with Zyklon-B. Description, Manufacturer, & Facts Britannica|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/Zyklon-B|access-date=2024-10-14|website=Britannica|language=en}} This was a rat poison which had cyanide. In a planned, organized, and methodical way, they deported trains full of people to the Extermination camp and sent them straight to the gas chambers. The Nazis killed around 1,100,000 people in concentration camp gas chambers using Zyklon-B. ===Other methods=== The Nazis Execution many people by shooting, stabbing, or beating them to death. Some people survived beatings, but suffered broken bones and/or died when their wounds got infected. ====Forced marches==== Many people also died in wikt:forced march from one camp to another. Some were killed in medical experiments by SS doctors like Josef Mengele. Others were Extermination through labor. ====Forced labor==== The Nazis also deliberately killed prisoners in some concentration camps by treating them so terribly that many died. They forced prisoners to do hard forced labor, but fed them very little (about 25% of the Calorie needed to survive). In the winter, prisoners did not have warm clothing or heating, and many Hypothermia. Others developed frostbite, which sometimes worsened into gangrene. ====Man-made pandemics==== Diseases spread quickly in the camps because there was no healthcare, no sanitation, and a lot of overcrowding. Louse were everywhere, and they spread typhus, which was "ever-present, both Endemic (epidemiology) and epidemic, [and] wikt:fatal". Other illnesses were common, including tuberculosis, malaria, meningitis, scabies, pneumonia, and Diarrhea diseases. Prisoners who were too sick or injured to work were often killed. ==Deaths== The Nazis killed at least 6,000,000 Jews during the Holocaust. File:Holocaustdeathtoll%.png ===Jews=== 67% European Jews were murdered in the Holocaust, including at least 3,000,000 Poland Jews. The Holocaust killed almost all of the Jewish children in Europe. Before World War II, there were about 1,600,000 Jewish children living in the lands that the Nazis would soon control. Only 6% of them survived World War II; between 1,000,000 and 1,500,000 died. Most European Jews had been killed by 1943 before reports of the mass extermination were received. As per the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM), * 2,700,000 Jews were killed at death camps * 2,000,000 Jews were killed in mass shootings and other Genocidal massacre * 800,000 to 1,000,000 Jews were killed in Ghettos in Europe during the Holocaust, forced labor camps and Concentration camp * 250,000 Jews were killed in other acts of violence, including tortures, Pogrom, Death march etc. The approximate proportions of Jews killed are as follows. * 90% of Jews in Poland * * * 90% of Polish Jews Died in the Holocaust.

Many people wrongly thought that all Jews became rich by stealing money from others, like Christianity. Many believed Jews only liked other Jews. Since at least the 2nd century BC, people have levelled a range of false accusations against Jews, including the blood libel – the lie that Jews are taking blood from Christian kids. File:Mein Kampf Völkischer Beobachter 31. Januar 1933.jpg's ''Mein Kampf'' in January 1933]] These beliefs were not true and were based on stereotypes. However, these beliefs were popular in the German language-speaking world and elsewhere in the late 1800s. Adolf Hitler was born in Austria during this time, when many people disliked Jews. He may have been Jealousy of Jewish success in Austria. However, in his book ''Mein Kampf'' ("My Struggle"), he said it was the Jews' fault that Germany and Austria lost World War I. Quotes, Summary, & Analysis Britannica|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Mein-Kampf|access-date=2024-10-18|website=Britannica|language=en}} He also said Germany's Economy problems were the Jews' fault. Many people agreed with Hitler’s ideas and supported him as the leader of the Nazi Party. Also, the Nazis justified the Holocaust with Conspiracy theory based on self-victimization and inversion of reality. They accused Jews of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion and blamed every problem on them. American historian Jeffrey Herf wrote in his Nonfiction ''The Jewish Enemy: Nazi Propaganda during World War II and the Holocaust'': Contrary to common perception, Herf said that Nazis' view of the Jews being an inferior race was not the Motivation for the Holocaust. Instead, it was the stereotype of Jews being an "all-powerful anti-German force" that made the Holocaust happen: American legal scholar Kenneth L. Marcus presented the idea '''Accusation in a Mirror''' ('''AiM''') to describe the Habit of genocide perpetrators – from Nazi Germans to Rwandan genocide – to accuse their victims of seeking a genocide against them in order to justify a genocide themselves. In psychology, such behaviour is called projection. ==Righteous Among the Nations== On the other hand, Some persons saved Jews during the Holocaust because they thought it was the right thing to do. Some of them were later given Righteous Among the Nations Award by Yad Vashem. Yad Vashem|url=https://www.yadvashem.org/righteous.html|access-date=2024-10-18|website=Yad Vashem|language=en}} ==Holocaust denial== Some Extremism say that the Holocaust did not happen or was not as bad as it was. This is called Holocaust denial, or Holocaust distortion. Many Holocaust deniers say that the Nazis did not kill so many victims. Instead, they claim many of them died because they were Disease or Starvation. However, a significant amount of evidence Proof that Holocaust deniers are wrong. Jews were killed because Hitler ordered it. In Germany and some other countries, it is criminal to deny the Holocaust.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6263103.stm "Push for EU Holocaust denial ban"], ''BBC News'', January 15, 2007. Retrieved May 13, 2010. ===Definition=== Contrary to public misconceptions, Holocaust denial does not only mean denying that the Holocaust happened. Instead, it also includes the following acts: # Intentional efforts to excuse or minimize the impact of the Holocaust or its principal elements, including collaborators and Axis powers; # Gross minimization of the number of the victims of the Holocaust in contradiction to Wikipedia:Reliable sources/Perennial sources; # Attempts to Victim blaming the Jews for causing their own genocide; # Statements that cast the Holocaust as a positive historical event. Those statements are not Holocaust denial but are closely connected to it as a radical form of antisemitism. They may suggest that the Holocaust did not go far enough in accomplishing its goal of “the Final Solution”; # Attempts to blur the responsibility for the establishment of List of Nazi concentration camps devised and operated by Nazi Germany by putting blame on other Nation or Ethnic group. For instance, someone acknowledging that the Holocaust happened while denying the Nazi use of poison gas is also a Holocaust denier. ===Recent trend=== A trend of Holocaust denial, some state-sponsored, is also seen in other List of European countries, including Austria, Croatia, * * * * * Czechia, Hungary, * * * Germany, Italy, Poland, * Robert Rozett, “Competitive Victimhood and Holocaust Distortion,” ''The Israel Journal of Foreign Affairs'', XVI (2022); “Distorting the Holocaust and Whitewashing History: Toward a Typology,” XIII: 1 (2019); Yehuda Bauer, “Creating a “Usable” Past: On Holocaust Denial and Distortion,” XIV: 2 (2022); and Jan Grabowski, “The Holocaust and Poland's 'History Policy'” X: 3 (2016). * Joanna Beata Michlic, “The Politics of the Memorialisation of the Holocaust in Poland: Reflections on the Current Misuses of the History of Rescue,” ''Jewish Historical Studies—Transactions of the Jewish Historical Society of England'', LIII: 1 (2022); Piotr Forecki, ''Po Jedwabnem: Anatomia pamięci funkcjonalnej'' (Kraków, 2018); Jan Gross, ''Neighbors: The Destruction of the Jewish Community in Jedwabne'' (Princeton, 2001). * Piotr Forecki, “Domestic ‘Assassins of Memory’: Various Faces of Holocaust Revisionism in Contemporary Poland,” presentation at a symposium in honor of Professor Antony Polonsky called “The Holocaust in Eastern Europe: sources, memory, politics,” March 16, 2021, UCL, London. * * Antony Polonsky and Joanna Beata Michlic (eds.), ''The Neighbors Respond: The Controversy over the Jedwabne Massacre in Poland'' (Princeton, 2009) and Laurence Weinbaum, “Amnesia and Antisemitism in the ‘Second Jagiellonian Age,’” ''Anti-Judaism, Antisemitism, and Delegitimizing Israel'', Robert Wistrich (ed.)

Some of those propaganda does not deny that the Holocaust happened. Instead, it casts doubt on the Holocaust's nature, ignores the historical context leading up to the Holocaust, and abusively compares the Holocaust to other historical events. Those propagandists do this to whitewash the Holocaust and Dehumanization Holocaust victims so as to Whitewashing Nazi antisemitism and justify the mass murder of Jews. Such behavior is rejected by mainstream historians, including Emil Fackenheim, Yehuda Bauer, Deborah Lipstadt and Daniel Goldhagen. Antisemites often accuse Jews of "owning the Holocaust" or "extorting compensation from European governments", and rewrite the Holocaust's history to Exaggeration Jewish collaboration with Nazi Germans so as to blame Jews for their own suffering. * * * * * * * * These false claims are common on social media. ==Related pages== * Holodomor * Rwandan genocide * Cambodian genocide * Secondary antisemitism * Double genocide theory ==Footnotes== ==References== Category:Genocide Category:World War II Category:Antisemitism Category:Jewish history Category:History of Europe Category:Genocides in Europe Category:Crimes against humanity
