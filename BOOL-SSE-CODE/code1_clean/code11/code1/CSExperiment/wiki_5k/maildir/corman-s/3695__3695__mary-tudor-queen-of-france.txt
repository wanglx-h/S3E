Mary was the fifth child of Henry VII of England and Elizabeth of York, and she was the youngest of their children to survive infancy. Louis was over 30 years older than her. After Louis’s death, Mary married Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk. This marriage took place secretly in France without the consent of Mary’s brother, Henry VIII. The union led to the involvement of Thomas Wolsey, a key advisor to Henry, and the couple was eventually pardoned after paying a significant fine. Mary had four children with Charles Brandon. Through her eldest daughter, '''Frances''', Mary became the maternal grandmother of Lady Jane Grey, who was queen of England for nine days in July 1553. == Biography == Mary was the fifth child of Henry VII of England and Elizabeth of York, born at '''Sheen Palace'''. Mary was known for her beauty and had a close relationship with her brother, Henry VIII. In 1514, she married Louis XII at the age of 18. Louis was much older and died less than three months after their wedding, and they had no children. Mary later married Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, in secret in 1515, without her brother’s permission. This was considered treason, but she and Charles were only fined due to Henry's affection for them. They officially married again later that year. Mary had four children with Charles and was often still referred to as the Queen of France. Her relationship with Henry became strained over his marriage to Catherine of Aragon and later Anne Boleyn. After suffering failing health for some years, Mary Tudor died on 25 June, 1533 at the age of thirty seven at Westhorpe Hall, Westhorpe, Suffolk, possibly of Tuberculosis, Cancer, or Angina. Her husband then married Catherine Willoughby. == References == Category:Kings and Queens consort of France Category:1495 births Category:1533 deaths
