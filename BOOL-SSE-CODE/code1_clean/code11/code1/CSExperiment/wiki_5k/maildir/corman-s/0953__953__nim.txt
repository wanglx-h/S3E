'''Nim''' is a simple game used for examples in combinatorial game theory. The rules of nim are simple: # The game begins with some piles of counters. # Players alternate turns. # On a turn, a player takes counters from a pile. At least one counter must be taken, but up to 3. All counters must be in the same pile. # If a player cannot take a counter, that player loses. There is a simple mathematical strategy to play the game perfectly. If both players play perfectly, the winner is determined by the initial setup. == Other websites == * [http://www.draftydraft.com/nim/ Nim Game] Category:Game theory
