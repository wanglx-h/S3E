It has very angry and low singing that sounds like Cookie Monster from the TV show Sesame Street. Most death metal has very fast guitar and drum beats. Almost every death metal drummer plays with two bass drums (or a type of pedal that has two beaters on one bass drum), so that they can play the bass drum beats faster. It is a kind of music focused on the beat and low sounds more than anything. The lyrics in death metal sometimes involve topics such as death, war and pain. Some bands choose to write about philosophy or religion. Some bands try to write about things that other death metal bands do not write about such as ancient history. Some death metal singers don't just sing low like Cookie Monster, others scream really loud too. Some Melodic death metal, and others Technical death metal.
