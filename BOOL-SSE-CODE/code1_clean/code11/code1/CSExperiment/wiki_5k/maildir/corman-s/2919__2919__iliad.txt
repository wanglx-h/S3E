File:THE ILLIAD OF HOMER (translated by POPE) p1.217 2d Book Page 89.jpg Image:Beginning Iliad.svg File:Homeric Greece-en.svg The '''''Iliad''''' ; spelled in English with a single '''l''', as in Greek. The word comes from ''Ileum'', an alternative name for Troy. is the oldest surviving work of Greek literature. It was an Oral history epic poem. People spoke it without reading it. It was written in the 8th century BC. It is an epic (or very long) poem with 24 Chapter (books) written in hexameter. The poem includes early Greek myths and legends. It may have been based on a Bronze Age attack on the city Troy. People usually say that Homer wrote the ''Iliad''. However, scholars are not sure that only one person really wrote the whole poem. The story happens during the Trojan War, some time around 1200 BC. It talks about the confrontations of the warrior Achilles and King Agamemnon. The story is only about a few weeks at the end of the war, but it also talks about many of the Greek myths about the war. It tells the story from the Anger of Achilles, to the death and funeral of Hector and the siege of Troy. Together with another of Homer's poems, the ''Odyssey'', it is one of the two major Ancient Greece epic poems. Some important characters in the ''Iliad'' are Achilles, Odysseus, Agamemnon, Menelaus, Priam, Hector, Paris (mythology), and Helen. == Plot == The poem starts with the god Apollo sending a plague to the Greeks, because they captured the daughter of one of his Trojan priests. Agamemnon is forced to give the daughter back. So that he has a girl of his own, Agamemnon takes the slavery Trojan girl Briseis from her owner Achilles. Achilles is angry and refuses to fight in the war. When Achilles' friend Patroclus is killed by Hector, Achilles starts to fight again and kills Hector in a duel. Later, Hector's father Priam comes in secret to Achilles to take back his favorite son's body to give it a proper funeral, which Achilles allows him to do. The poem ends with the funeral of Hector. ==Related pages== * Trojan War * ''Odyssey'' == References == ==Sources== *Fagles, Robert (transl) 1990. ''The Iliad''.
