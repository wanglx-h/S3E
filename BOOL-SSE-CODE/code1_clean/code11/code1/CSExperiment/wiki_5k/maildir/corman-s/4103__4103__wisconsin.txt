The Capital (political) of Wisconsin is Madison, Wisconsin. The biggest city in Wisconsin is Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In 2018, most of Wisconsin’s immigrants came from Mexico, India, China, Laos and the Philippines. == History == Native Americans first settled in Wisconsin before the arrival of Europeans. == Origin == The word ''Wisconsin'' comes from the name that one of the Algonquian languages speaking American Indian groups living in the area gave to the Wisconsin River. They named the Wisconsin River at the time that the European colonization of the Americas happened. Jacques Marquette, a France , was the first European (or person from Europe) to get to the Wisconsin River and write down the name. He reached the Wisconsin River in 1673. He wrote the name of the river as ''Meskousing'' in his wikt:journal. Over time, other explorers from France this name into ''Ouisconsin''. This is now the French name for the Wisconsin River. As of 1845, the government of the Wisconsin Territory gave the name ''Wisconsin'' to the Wisconsin River. ==Cultures== Many people in Wisconsin go skiing, ice fishing and to snowmobile Racings. The National Football League's Green Bay Packers team is popular. So is the Milwaukee Brewers Major League Baseball team. Music events include the Summerfest. There is the Milwaukee Art Museum. Circle Sanctuary is the largest Wiccan organization in the U.S. == Geography == The Montreal River flows along the border of Wisconsin. Lake Superior and Michigan border Wisconsin to the north. Lake Michigan is to the east of Wisconsin, and Illinois is found directly south of Wisconsin. Other rivers that make up the border of Wisconsin include the Mississippi River and St. Croix River (Wisconsin-Minnesota) to the west and the Menominee River to the northeast. Wisconsin borders Minnesota, Michigan, Illinois, and Iowa. Wisconsin is divided into 72 counties. Wisconsin has a lot of different kinds of geography and is very wikt:diverse. Wisconsin is made up of five main areas of geography. The Lake Superior Lowland to the north is an area of land that is right against Lake Superior. The Northern Highland area of Wisconsin is to the south of the Lake Superior Lowland. This area contains trees and other kinds of forests. The Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest (1,500,000 acres big), is found in this area. The highest point in Wisconsin, Timms Hill, is in the Northern Highland area. The Central Plain (Wisconsin) area is found in the central part of Wisconsin. Lots of sandstone , such as the Dells of the Wisconsin River, are found in the Central Plain area. The Eastern Ridges and Lowlands area is found in the southeastern part of Wisconsin. Many of the biggest cities in Wisconsin are in the Eastern Ridges and Lowlands area. The Western Upland area is in the southwestern part of the state. This area includes wikt:features like bluffs along the Mississippi River and forests and farmland (land put aside for farming). === Climate change === The highest temperature ever recorded in Wisconsin was in the Wisconsin Dells. It was wikt:recorded on July 13, 1936. The temperature reached 120°F (46°C). The lowest temperature in Wisconsin ever written down was in the village of Couderay, Wisconsin. The temperature there was only –55°F (-48°C). This was recorded on both February 2 and February 4, 1996. == Cities and important towns == Wisconsin has cities and towns of many different sizes. Nearly 70 percent of people living in Wisconsin live in urban areas (cities like Milwaukee). 33 percent of the population of Wisconsin lives in the Greater Milwaukee area. Milwaukee is found at the northern end of a string of cities and towns along Lake Michigan. With almost 600,000 people living in Milwaukee, that makes Milwaukee the 22nd-largest city in the country. Madison is also another important city in Wisconsin. With a population of just over 225,000 people, it is a city that grows very fast. A suburb of Madison, Middleton, Wisconsin, was also wikt:ranked the "Best Place to Live in America" in 2007 by ''CNN Money''. There are a bunch of medium-sized cities and towns (meaning their populations are between 25,000 and 100,000 people) in Wisconsin. 12 cities in Wisconsin with a population of 50,000 or more. ==Related pages== * List of cities in Wisconsin == References == == Other websites == * [http://www.nationalatlas.gov/printable/images/pdf/reference/pagegen_wi.pdf Map of Wisconsin at nationalatlas.gov] * [http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/55000.html U.S. Census Bureau] * [http://www.wisconsin.gov/ State of Wisconsin] * [http://dnr.wi.gov/eek/nature/state/ Wisconsin state symbols] * [http://www.legis.state.wi.us/ Wisconsin State Legislature] * [http://www.wicourts.gov/ Wisconsin Court System] * [http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/state-fact-sheets/state-data.aspx?StateFIPS=55&StateName=Wisconsin#.U8U2zrEXtQs USDA Wisconsin State Facts] * [http://www.lmhscscorecard.com/sc/brief.cgi?s=1 Wisconsin Health and Demographic Data] * [http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/state/state_energy_profiles.cfm?sid=WI Energy Profile for Wisconsin- Economic, environmental, and energy data] * [http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/ Wisconsin Historical Society] * [http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/topics/wisconsin-name/ Wisconsin's Name: Where It Came From and What It Means] * [http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/WI The State of Wisconsin Collection] from the [http://uwdc.library.wisc.edu/ UW Digital Collections Center] * [http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/whi/ Wisconsin Historical Images] Category:Wisconsin Category:1848 establishments in the United States
