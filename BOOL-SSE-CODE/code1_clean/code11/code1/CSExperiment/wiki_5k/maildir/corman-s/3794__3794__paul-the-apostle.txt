File:Workshop of Peter Paul Rubens - Saint Paul.jpg of Paul of Tarsus by Peter Paul Rubens]] '''Paul the Apostle''', (born as '''Saul of Tarsus''') and also often called '''Saint Paul''' (2BC–64/65), was a Messianic Judaism-Roman Empire writer and rabbi. He was a convert to Christianity. It is believed that he wrote thirteen books of the Bible, together called the Pauline epistles. They are letters to churches and Christians. He wrote these letters to encourage them, to help them understand Christian teaching, and to help them to live Christian lives. == Life == === Anti-Christian === File:Conversion on the Way to Damascus-Caravaggio (c.1600-1).jpg for a church in Italy, showing Saul lying by the side of the road]] Paul's name was originally '''Saul''' (not to be confused with King Saul from the books of Samuel in the Old Testament). He grew up learning both the Judaism law and the Ancient Greece ways of discussing things. We are first introduced to Saul in the Bible near the end of Acts 7. The Christian movement had begun with the Resurrection of Jesus and Ascension of Jesus of Jesus. Saul was strongly against this, and he was happy as he watched Saint Stephen, the first martyr of Jesus, being killed by stoning after giving a Public speaking that made the Jewish court angry. He worked for the Roman Empire Government and helped lead the arrests and killing of many Christians in Israel and the nearby area. Later on, Saul was told to go to Damascus to find and bring back Christians there to be punished. On the way, God came down from heaven and spoke to Saul. The Bible tells of what happened like this: File:PaulusTarsus LKANRW.jpg of Paul the Apostle]] === Saul becomes Paul === When Saul reached Damascus, he was taken to Ananias, one of Jesus's Disciple (Christianity), where he got his sight back and was baptism as a Christian. He spent the next three years studying the Jewish scriptures again to find explanations for the Christian teachings. His experiences changed his view on Christianity completely. In Acts 13:9, he begins to be called Paul. This was the Hellenic languages version of the name Saul. He used his earlier education to explain his new faith to other people and to discuss things with people who had other beliefs. He travelled around the Roman Empire, teaching others about Christianity, and wrote letters back and forth with the churches he helped to begin. The letters contain many important parts of Christian teaching and have since been part of the New Testament of the Bible, coming between the Acts of the Apostles and the General Epistles. It is not known whether Paul actually wrote all of these letters, or whether other people could have written the letters for him. Parts of these letters are read at Mass (liturgy) as the second of two readings that come before the Gospel. Although the Bible does not say how Paul died, various writers said Paul was put to death by orders of the emperor Nero in ancient Rome, in 64/65 AD. He had the rights of Roman citizenship, which meant that he could be put to death by decapitation with a sword, rather than by crucifixion. Some stories say he was decapitated. ==Related pages== *Twelve Apostles == Other websites == * [http://www.easyenglish.info/bible-study/early-church/index.htm Online study about the early Christians in simple English] * [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/11952-paul-of-tarsus Jewish Encyclopedia: Saul of Tarsus (known as Paul, the Apostle of the Heathen)] * [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/447019/Saint-Paul-the-Apostle "Saint Paul, the Apostle".] Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 2009.
