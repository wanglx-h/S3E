Subject: Wikipedia:Template messages
Templates are used within pages to provide the same message over and over again. Changes to the look, wording, or style of the message can be done quickly, because templates are made again for the reader when the article loads. In other words, when the message is changed, you do not need to update a page that uses it if you use a template. Standard notices that might be on a page for months or forever should be ":en:Wikipedia:Transclusion" for easy updating. This loads the current version of the message and puts it on the page every time you load it. Some templates are used to tell people something about the article. Other templates (also called navboxes) are used to give links to other articles. These templates are in :Category:Navigational boxes. For any of these messages, you can include "subst:" (as in ) when inserting them to put the full text into the page. Doing this means that any future changes to the template will not be shown in that article, but it can be useful sometimes. To make a new message, start a page in the Template namespace. The title should be "Template:", then the name of your message. The page should then be written with the text of your message. Add your new template to this list. ==Article content== These templates are used to let people know about issues with the information in the article. {| border="1" |- ! Name !! Current text !!

I noticed that you recently made a new article or made changes to one by adding things copied from a book, magazine, newspaper or another website without the Wikipedia:Copyrights. Many sources, including websites found on the Internet, are copyrighted. I am afraid Wikipedia cannot accept '''any''' things copied from these sources as it can get Wikipedia into serious legal trouble. The article or changes have been or will soon be deleted. Next time, please look up sources to find out ''information'' for articles and explain it in your own words, and do not copy ''sentences'' or ''images'' from them.
