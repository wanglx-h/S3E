Athletics}} '''Track and field''' is part of the sport of athletics. Athletics is a collection of sport events that includes running, jumping and ''throwing''. Track and field events take place in a sports stadium, either on the running track, or on the field inside the running track. These tracks are generally made up of synthetic rubber – rubber particles bound with latex or polyurethane.
