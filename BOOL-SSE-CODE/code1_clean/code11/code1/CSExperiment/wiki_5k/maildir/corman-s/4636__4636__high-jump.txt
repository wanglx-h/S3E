File:Yelena Slesarenko jumping 2007.jpg The '''high jump''' is a track and field athletics event. Without the aid of any devices, athletes jump over a horizontal wikt:bar placed at measured heights. The high jump was first practised in England in the 19th century. It became an Olympics sport in 1896 for men and in 1928 for women. The rules that were made in 1865 still exist today. Thus, every Sportsperson has three attempts on every height. The athletes are allowed to touch the bar but they must not knock it down. The women's world record of 2.10 metres is held by Yaroslava Mahuchikh. It was set in 2024. Eearlier (1987) Stefka Kostadinova jumped 2.09 metres. That record was set in 1987.
