Depending on the type of van, it can be bigger or smaller than a pickup truck and SUV, and bigger than a common car but relatively smaller than a truck/lorry or a bus. There is some variation in the scope of the word across the different English-speaking countries. The smallest vans, microvans, are used for transporting either goods or people in tiny quantities. Mini MPVs, compact MPVs, and Multi-purpose vehicle are all small vans usually used for transporting people in small quantities. Larger vans with passenger seats are used for institutional purposes, such as transporting students. Larger vans with only front seats are often used for business purposes, to carry goods and equipment. Specially equipped vans are used by television stations as mobile studios. Postal services and courier companies use large step vans to deliver packages. Many companies make vans, including Chevrolet, Daihatsu, Dodge, Fiat, Ford Motor Company, GMC, Honda, Hyundai, Isuzu, Mazda, Mercedes-Benz, Mitsubishi Motors, Nissan, Subaru, Suzuki, Toyota, Vauxhall Motors, and Volkswagen. You may usually drive a van with the same driver's license as an ordinary car, but the heaviest and largest vans may require a truck licence. == List of van models == ==Minivan== A minivan is smaller and usually carries up to three people (like in Hatchback, Station wagon, and SUV. ==Related pages== * Ambulance * Pickup truck * Truck Category:Vans
