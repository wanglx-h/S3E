He also said that all of modern physics is wrong. Scientist reject these ideas, saying that they make no sense and cannot be tested. On his site, Ray said that not believing in Time Cube would be "stupid and evil". Some of his comments were racism and Discrimination towards black people, Judaism, and homosexuality people. Many people found the site to be difficult to understand. Ray spoke about Time Cube at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in January 2002.
