File:IBCAO betamap.jpg The '''Arctic Ocean''' is the ocean around the North Pole. The most northern parts of Eurasia and North America are around the Arctic Ocean. Thick pack ice and snow cover almost all of the ocean in winter and most of it in summer. An icebreaker and a nuclear-powered submarine can use the Northwest Passage through the Arctic Ocean to go between the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean Oceans. The Arctic Ocean has an area ocean of 14.056 million km2, the smallest of the world's five oceans, and it has a coastline of . The central surface is covered by ice about thick. Its biology is quite special. Endangered species include walruses, whales, and polar bears. Year by year, the Arctic Ocean is becoming less icy as a result of global warming. The average depth of the Arctic Ocean is . Its deepest point is in the Eurasian Basin, at . == Geography == The Arctic Ocean covers an area of about 14,056,000km2. The coastline is 45,390km (28,200mi) long It is surrounded by Eurasia, North America, and Greenland and several other islands. The ocean is generally taken to include Baffin Bay, Barents Sea, Beaufort Sea, Chukchi Sea, East Siberian Sea, Greenland Sea, Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Kara Sea, Laptev Sea, White Sea, and other bodies of water. It is connected to the Pacific Ocean by the Bering Strait and to the Atlantic Ocean by the Greenland Sea and the Labrador Sea. Countries bordering the Arctic Ocean are Russia, Norway, Iceland, Greenland (part of Denmark), Canada, and the United States. == Climate == The Arctic Ocean has a polar climate. Its winter is characterized by the polar night, cold and stable weather conditions, and clear skies. The temperature of the surface of the ocean is fairly constant, near the freezing point of Salt water. The ocean consists of saltwater but has less salinity than other oceans have. The ocean's temperature must reach −1.8°C (28.8°F) before freezing occurs. Ice covers almost all of the Arctic Ocean in late winter and the majority of it in late summer. Much of the Arctic ice pack is covered in snow for about 10 months of the year. The maximum snow cover is in March or April, at about 20–50cm (7.9–19.7 in.). The climate of the Arctic region has varied significantly in the past. As recently as 55 million years ago, during the Eocene epoch, the region reached an average annual temperature of 10–20°C (50–68°F). The surface waters of the Arctic Ocean warmed enough to support Tropics lifeforms. == Animal and plant life == Endangered species marine species in the Arctic Ocean include Walrus and Whale. The area has a fragile ecosystem. The Arctic Ocean has relatively little plant life except for phytoplankton. A crucial part of the ocean, phytoplankton feeds on nutrients from the rivers and currents of the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans. == References == == Other websites == * [http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/explorations/05arctic/welcome.html The Hidden Ocean Arctic 2005] Daily logs, photos and video from exploration mission. * [http://www.whoi.edu/imageOfDay.do Oceanography Image of the Day], from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution * [http://www.arctic-council.org Arctic Council] * [http://www.northernforum.org The Northern Forum] * [http://vitalgraphics.grida.no/arcticmap Arctic Environmental Atlas] Interactive map * [http://www.arctic.noaa.gov NOAA Arctic Theme Page] * * [http://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0060.html Daily Arctic Ocean Rawinsonde Data from Soviet Drifting Ice Stations (1954–1990)] at NSIDC * [http://www.unaami.noaa.gov Arctic time series: The Unaami Data collection] * [http://www.arctic.noaa.gov/gallery_np.html NOAA North Pole Web Cam] Images from Web Cams deployed in spring on an ice floe * [http://www.arctic.noaa.gov/gallery_np_weatherdata.html NOAA Near-realtime North Pole Weather Data] Data from instruments deployed on an ice floe * [https://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,63980,00.html ''Search for Arctic Life Heats Up'' by Stephen Leahy] * [http://www.polarfoundation.org/ International Polar Foundation] * [http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/ National Snow and Ice Data Center – Daily report of Arctic ice cover based on satellite data] * [http://www.marbef.org/wiki/Arctic_Ocean Marine Biodiversity Wiki] Category:Oceans Category:Arctic
