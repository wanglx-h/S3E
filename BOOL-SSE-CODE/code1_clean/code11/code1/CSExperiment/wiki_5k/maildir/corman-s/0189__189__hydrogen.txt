Subject: Hydrogen
'''Hydrogen''' is the lightest and most abundant chemical element in the universe. It is the simplest element and the first in the periodic table. It has the chemical symbol '''H''' and atomic number 1, which means it has just one proton in its Atomic nucleus. Hydrogen also has a Relative atomic mass of 1.008. Hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas at room temperature. It is also highly flammable. When hydrogen burns in oxygen, it creates water and releases a lot of energy. Properties, Uses, & Facts Britannica|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/hydrogen|access-date=2025-05-26|website=www.britannica.com|language=en}} Hydrogen can be found as H₂ molecules. This means two hydrogen atoms join together to make a stable gas. It has a very low boiling point and melting point, so it becomes a liquid or solid only at extremely cold temperatures. There are also different forms, or isotopes of hydrogen. The most common is protium, which has just one proton. There is also deuterium, which has one proton and one neutron, and tritium, which has one proton and two neutrons and is radioactive decay. Hydrogen is very reactive, especially with oxygen and other nonmetals. It often forms compounds like water (H₂O), methane (CH₄), and ammonia (NH₃). Hydrogen is the most common element in the universe. It makes up 75% of all normal matter by mass. Most of the hydrogen is found in stars, including the Sun. It fuels the process of nuclear fusion, giving off light and heat. On Earth, hydrogen is not usually found as a pure gas because it is so light and reactive. Instead, it is most commonly found in chemical compounds. It can be found especially in water (H₂O), which covers about 70% of Earth’s surface. Hydrogen is also found in living things, because it is part of many organic compounds, such as sugars, fats, and proteins. Hydrogen can be found in fossil fuels and in some minerals. It can also be found in volcanic gases and the upper atmosphere, where it slowly escapes into Outer space because of its lightness. Hydrogen is very reactive, especially because it has only one electron. This makes it easy for hydrogen to form bonds with other elements. It usually forms molecules like H₂, where two hydrogen atoms share their electrons to become more stable. Hydrogen reacts easily with oxygen to form water (H₂O). This reaction releases a lot of energy and is why hydrogen is used as a fuel in rockets and fuel cells. It also reacts with many nonmetals, such as chlorine, to form compounds like hydrogen chloride (HCl). Hydrogen can act as both a reducing agent (it gives electrons) and, in some cases, as an Oxidizing agent (it takes electrons). Hydrogen can also form acids when combined with certain elements. For example, when it bonds with chlorine, it creates hydrochloric acid when dissolved in water. It can also form hydrides when it reacts with metals, where hydrogen behaves like a Anion. The history of hydrogen goes back to the 1700s, when scientists first began studying gases. In 1766, the British scientist Henry Cavendish was the first to recognize hydrogen as a separate gas. He called it “inflammable air” because it burned easily and produced water when it reacted with air. Later, in 1783, the famous French scientist Antoine Lavoisier gave the gas its modern name: hydrogen, which means “water-former” in Greek language. He realized that water is not an element but a compound made from hydrogen and oxygen. In the 1800s and 1900s, scientists learned more about hydrogen’s properties and uses. It became important in chemical industry, like making ammonia for fertilizer. It was also used in airships, although this was dangerous because hydrogen can catch fire easily. One tragic example was the Hindenburg in 1937, when a hydrogen-filled airship caught fire. In the 20th and 21st centuries, liquid hydrogen was used as rocket fuel. It has also gained attention as a renewable energy. Hydrogen does not exist freely in large amounts on Earth, so it must be produced by us. The two main ways to make hydrogen are steam reforming and electrolysis. Steam reforming is the most common method. It involves heating natural gas (mostly methane) with steam to release hydrogen. This process is widely used in Industry. Electrolysis is another method that uses electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. However, electrolysis is more expensive than steam reforming. Hydrogen can also be produced using other methods, such as biological processes (using bacteria or algae) and Thermochemical cycles that use heat from Nuclear energy or solar energy. Once produced, hydrogen is usually stored as a gas under pressure, or as a liquid at very low temperatures, so it can be used in industries, fuel cells, and rockets. Hydrogen has many important uses in industry, science, and energy. One of its biggest uses is in making ammonia (NH₃) through the Haber process. Ammonia is used to produce fertilizers, which help grow food for people around the world. Hydrogen is also used in Oil refinery to help remove sulfur from fuels. It is used in making methanol, which is a basic chemical for making plastics and other products. In energy, hydrogen is used as a renewable energy. It can power fuel cells, which produce electricity without Air pollution. The only byproduct is water. Fuel cells are used in some cars, buses, and even spacecrafts. Hydrogen is also important in space exploration. It is used as a rocket fuel because it burns with a lot of energy and produces only water vapor. Liquid hydrogen, combined with liquid oxygen, has been used to launch many rockets. == Properties == Hydrogen is grouped as a Nonmetal. This is different from the other elements found in the first Group (periodic table) of the periodic table, which are called alkali metals. Only the solid form of hydrogen should behave like a metal, though. When hydrogen is by itself, it will normally chemical bond with itself to make '''dihydrogen''' (H2). Dihydrogen is very :wikt:stable because of its high bond-dissociation energy of 435.7 kJ/mol. At Standard temperature and pressure, hydrogen gas (H2) has no Colour, smell, or taste. It is also not Poison. This is because it is a nonmetal and burns very easily. Hydrogen gas at this state also has low density and is not Corrosive substance. === Combustion === Molecule hydrogen is :wikt:flammable and Chemical reaction with oxygen: 2 H2(g) + O2(g) → 2 H2O(l) + 572 kJ (286 kJ/mol) Hydrogen gas can be very dangerous. It can explode when mixed with air or certain gases. If hydrogen gas makes up between 4% and 74% of the air, it can catch fire and Explosion. It can also explode when mixed with Chlorine. This happens if the mixture has between 5% and 95% hydrogen. Hydrogen can catch fire by itself if it gets hot enough. This happens at a temperature of about 500°C (932°F). In some cases, if hydrogen leaks out under high pressure, the force of the leak can heat the air around it to that temperature. This can cause the gas to burst into flames or even explode. Hydrogen flames are hard to see. They burn with a faint blue color and give off ultraviolet light. The human eye cannot see ultraviolet light. In daylight, it is almost impossible to see a hydrogen fire. That is why special flame detectors are used to find hydrogen fires and keep people safe.

Hydrogen also forms massive :wikt:array with carbon atoms, forming hydrocarbons. The :wikt:study of the properties of hydrocarbons is known as organic chemistry. The H- anion (negatively Electric charge atom) is named a hydride, though the word is not commonly used. An example of a hydride is lithium hydride (LiH), which is used as a "spark plug" in nuclear weapons. === Acids === Acids Dissolution in water normally :wikt:contain high levels of hydrogen ions, in other words, free protons. Their level is generally used to :wikt:determine its pH, that is, the :wikt:content of hydrogen ions in a volume. For example, hydrochloric acid, found in people's stomachs, can Dissociation (chemistry) into a chloride anion and a free proton, and the property of the free proton is how it can digest food by Corrosion it. Though uncommon on Earth, the H3+ cation is one of the most common ions in the universe. === Isotopes === Hydrogen has 7 known isotopes, two of which are stable (1H and 2H), which are commonly named protium and deuterium. The isotope 3H is known as tritium, has a Half-life (element) of 12.33 years, and is produced in small amounts by cosmic rays. The 4 isotopes left have half-lives on the scale of Orders of magnitude (time)#Seconds. == Hydrogen in nature == In its natural form on Earth, hydrogen is generally a gas. Hydrogen is also one of the parts that make up a water molecule. Hydrogen is important because it is the fuel that powers the Sun and other stars. Hydrogen makes up about 74% of the complete universe. Natural hydrogen is normally made of two hydrogen atoms connected together. Scientists name these diatomic molecules. Hydrogen will have a chemical reaction when mixed with most other elements, though it has no color or Odor. Natural hydrogen is very uncommon in the Earth's Atmosphere of Earth, because nearly all wikt:en:primordial hydrogen would have :wikt:escape into space because of its weight. In nature, it is generally in water. Hydrogen is also in all living things, as a part of the organic compounds that living things are made of. In addition, hydrogen atoms can join with carbon atoms to form hydrocarbons. Petroleum and other fossil fuels are made of these hydrocarbons and commonly used to make energy.

(1672). "Tracts written by the Honourable Robert Boyle containing new experiments, touching the relation betwixt flame and air..." London. In 1776, Henry Cavendish :wikt:identify it as its own Elementary particle and named it "inflammable air". He saw in 1781 that burning it made water.Boyle, R. (1672). "Tracts written by the Honourable Robert Boyle containing new experiments, touching the relation betwixt flame and air..." London. File:Emissions Spectra.webm Antoine Lavoisier gave Hydrogen its name, from the Greek language word for water, 'υδορ (read /HEEW-dor/) and gennen meaning to "produce" as it forms water in a chemical reaction with oxygen. ===Big Bang (or the creation of our universe)=== Hydrogen did nothttps://www.astronomy.com/science/how-did-the-first-element-form-after-the-big-bang/. Retrieved 2024-10-21 begin to form a second after the Big Bang. These hydrogens did not have any Neutron or Electron. The first neutral hydrogen with an electron would not form until 380,000 years later during the Recombination (cosmology), when the universe was cold enough for hydrogens to attract electrons. == Uses of Hydrogen == The most common uses are in the petroleum industry and in making ammonia by the Haber process. Some is used in other places in the Chemical substance industry. A little of it is used as fuel, for example in rockets for spacecraft. Most of the hydrogen that people use comes from a chemical reaction between natural gas and steam. === Nuclear fusion === Nuclear fusion is a very powerful :wikt:source of energy. It depends on forcing atoms together to make helium and energy, as in a star like the Sun, or in a Nuclear weapon. This needs a large amount of energy to get started, and is not easy to do currently. A big :wikt:advantage over nuclear fission, which is used in today's nuclear power stations, is that it makes less nuclear waste and does not use a poisonous and uncommon fuel like uranium. More than 600 million Metric tons of hydrogen undergo fusion every second on the Sun. === Using hydrogen === Hydrogen is mostly used in the petroleum industry, to change heavy petroleum parts into lighter, more useful ones. It is also used to make ammonia. Smaller amounts are burned as fuel. Most hydrogen is made by a reaction between natural gas and steam. The electrolysis of water breaks water into hydrogen and oxygen, using electricity. Burning hydrogen joins with oxygen molecules to make steam (natural water vapor). A fuel cell joins hydrogen with an oxygen molecule, :wikt:release an electron as electricity. For these reasons, many people believe hydrogen power will replace other synthetic fuels in the future. Hydrogen can also be burned to make heat for steam turbines or internal combustion engines. Like other synthetic fuels, hydrogen can be made from natural fuels such as coal or natural gas, or from electricity, and therefore represents a valuable addition to the Electric power transmission; in the same :wikt:role as natural gas. Such a grid and :wikt:infrastructure with fuel cell vehicles is now :wikt:plan by a number of countries, such as Japan, Korea and many European countries. This lets these countries :wikt:buy less petroleum, which is an :wikt:economic advantage. The other advantage is that, used in a fuel cell or burned in a combustion engine as in a hydrogen car, the engine does not make pollution. Only water, and a small amount of nitrogen oxides, forms. == References == == Other websites == * [https://en.citizendium.org/wiki/Hydrogen Hydrogen] - Citizendium Category:Hydrogen
