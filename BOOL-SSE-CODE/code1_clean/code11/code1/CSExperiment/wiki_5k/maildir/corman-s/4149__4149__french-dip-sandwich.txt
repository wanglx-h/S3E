Subject: French dip sandwich
The '''French dip sandwich''' is a popular dish. It is a sandwich, usually on French bread, with roast beef on the inside. It comes with a special sauce called ''jus'' which is usually made with the juice and fat that came off the roast beef when they were cooking it. It was not originally from France; two restaurants in Los Angeles, California, California, ''Cole's'' and ''Philippe's'', both claim to have invented it. ==Related pages== * Cheesesteak ==Other websites== *b:Cookbook:French Dip Sandwiches Category:Sandwiches
