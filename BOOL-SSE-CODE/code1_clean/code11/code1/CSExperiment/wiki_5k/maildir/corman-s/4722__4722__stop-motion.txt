Clay animation is also an example of how stop motion is used. Stop-motion requires any camera that can make single frames (or photos). It works by shooting a single frame, moving the object a little bit, and capturing a frame again. Cartoons use a similar way; one of the main differences is that stop motion uses real objects instead of drawn. Stop-motion is also popular among Child as it is an easy technique to do, as many children currently have Mobile device. Tim Burton, Will Vinton and the Aardman studio have used this method in their productions. ==Related pages== * Clay Category:Animation
