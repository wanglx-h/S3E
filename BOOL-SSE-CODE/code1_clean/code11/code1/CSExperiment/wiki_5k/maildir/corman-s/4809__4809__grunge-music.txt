It started in the mid- 1980s in the Pacific Northwest of the United States, especially in the state of Washington. It became more popular in the early 1990s. Grunge songs often had lyrics with nihilism, depression, unhappiness, or apathy as themes. The widespread use of heroin as a recreational drug found its way into the lyrics and careers of numerous grunge rockers, notably Kurt Cobain and Layne Staley of "Alice in Chains". The songs often had light (or clean) guitar sounds in the verses, and the high energy boost of distorted (or dirty) guitars in the choruses. The line-up for these bands was the typical rock band of guitars, bass, drums and vocal. Although grunge as a movement became less popular by the end of the 1990s, its influence is still heard in many bands. Grunge musical sounds were copied by post-grunge bands such as Foo Fighters and Nickelback and nu metal bands such as Korn and Limp Bizkit. ==Sound== Grunge music uses music from punk rock and heavy metal music. Grunge guitar players use Distortion (music) electric guitar. Like punk and heavy metal, grunge bands use electric guitar, bass guitar, a drummer and a singer. ==Grunge artists== Some well known grunge artists were: * Alice in Chains * Melvins * Mother Love Bone * Mudhoney * Nirvana (band) * Pearl Jam * Screaming Trees * Smashing Pumpkins * Soundgarden * Stone Temple Pilots * Tad (band) * Temple of the Dog ==References== Category:Rock music Category:Alternative music Category:Music in Seattle Category:Punk rock
