There are many languages of Wiktionary. Wiktionary is also a thesaurus. Wiktionary is run by the Wikimedia Foundation, which also runs Wikipedia. The English Wiktionary currently has over 7.3 million pages and 4.0 million users.[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Special:Statistics Special:Statistics - Wiktionary] - Retrieved on February 19, 2023. Much like Wikipedia, the Wiktionary is run in several different languages that can be selected from its wikt:Main Page. These include the Simple English Wiktionary. ==Logo== In 2006, there was a vote for the change of the logo of Wiktionary. The original logo of only words was replaced. However, there were very few people who voted in this contest. Therefore, smaller wikis used the newer logo but the English language Wiktionary stayed with the same logo. In 2009, there was a second contest for a newer logo ''(pictured)''. This was a step to make all the Wiktionaries to have the same logo on all projects. However, the English Wiktionary still did not use the new logo. The Simple English Wiktionary voted on the new logo on November 30, 2010 and the community decided the new logo to use it as their logo.[http://simple.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Simple_talk/Archive_15#New_Wiktionary_logo New Wiktionary Logo vote - Simple English Wiktionary] - Retrieved April 20, 2011 However, no changes were made to the logo and the discussion was thus forgotten. ==References== ==Other websites== * :wikt:Main Page * :wikt:en: * :meta:List of Wiktionaries by language family Category:Online dictionaries Category:Wikimedia Category:Wikis Category:Websites established in 2002
