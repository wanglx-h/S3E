File: Map of Great Plains.svg of the Great Plains with a red line showing the 100th meridian]] The '''Great Plains''' is a plain or prairie in the middle and western parts of North America. It is a steppe or grassland. The western boundary is the Rocky Mountains. In the east, the Great Plains grassland becomes the tallgrass of the Mississippi River basin. The prairie is (in whole or part) in eleven U.S. states, and in the southern parts of three Canadian provinces. In the Great Plains, summers are hot and humid, but winters are cold. Bison used to number millions, and were the main food for people there. Now the area is mainly sown with cereal crops which feed cattle and people. == Related pages == *Grassland == Other websites == *[http://www.lib.ndsu.nodak.edu/govdocs/text/greatplains/text.html North Dakota State University: ''The Geologic Story of The Great Plains''] *[http://www.kansasheritage.org/prairie/ Kansas Heritage Group: ''Native Prairie, Preserve, Flowers, and Research''] *[http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/award97/ndfahtml/ngphome.html Library of Congress: ''Great Plains''] *[http://www.unl.edu/plains/ University of Nebraska-Lincoln: ''The Great Plains Study''] Category:Plains Category:Regions of Canada Category:Regions of the United States
