The '''Romance languages''' (also sometimes called '''Latin languages''' or '''Neo-Latin languages''') are a language family in the Indo-European languages. They started from Vulgar Latin (in Latin, ''vulgar'' is the word for "common" and so "Vulgar Latin" means "Common Latin"). The most spoken Romance languages are Spanish language, Portuguese language, French language, Italian language and Romanian language. They are called "Romance languages" because they originate from Latin, the language spoken by the Western Roman Empire. Their grammatical inflection system has been simplified with the loss of most of the complex Case (grammar) of Classical Latin. The area that the Romance languages are spoken in Europe mostly was in the Western Roman Empire. The Greek language superseded Latin in the Eastern Roman Empire. Latin survived in Romania, whose language, Romanian language, is a Romance language. In Moldova, it is sometimes called Moldovan language. == Demographics == File:Romance-procents.png of speakers of each Romance language, out of the total speakers of all the Romance languages]] The Romance language family is one of the largest in the world have a total of almost a billion First language and second language speakers.
