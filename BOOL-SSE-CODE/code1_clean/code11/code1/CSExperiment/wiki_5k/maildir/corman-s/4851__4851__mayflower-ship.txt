Image:Mayflower in Plymouth Harbor, by William Halsall.jpg In 1620, the '''''Mayflower''''' brought 102 passengers from England and Holland to what is now Cape Cod. The group included people seeking Freedom of religion. This voyage is one of the most famous in early History of the United States. The Pilgrims aboard the ''Mayflower'' intended to sail to the Colony of Virginia. They landed instead on Cape Cod and formed the Plymouth Colony.Eugene Aubrey Stratton. ''Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691,'' (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 17 == Voyage == The ''Mayflower'' left England with the ship ''Speedwell'' on 15 August 1620, carrying Pilgrims from England and Holland. However, the ''Speedwell'' turned out to be unseaworthy. Both ships were twice forced to return to England. The ''Mayflower'' finally left Plymouth, Devon on 16 September 1620. On 19 November 1620 they spotted land. However, because of storms and navigation problems, they were much farther north than they intended. On 21 November 1620 they landed on Cape Cod. The passengers lived on the ship for a few months. They went ashore to build shelters during the day, then returned to the ship at night. During the winter of 1620-1621, about half of the passengers died. By March 1621, there were enough shelters for everyone to live on land. === Mayflower Compact === ''See the main article: Mayflower Compact'' While still aboard the ''Mayflower'', the Pilgrims wrote a set of rules about how they would live and treat each other.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, ''Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691,'' (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), pp. 20, 411-413George Ernest Bowman, '' The Mayflower Compact and its signers'', (Boston: Massachusetts Society of Mayflower Descendants, 1920). Photocopies of the 1622, 1646 and 1669 versions of the document pp. 7–19. This is an important document in American history. It includes Democracy ideals, and it designed a framework for the first government in what is now the United States.
