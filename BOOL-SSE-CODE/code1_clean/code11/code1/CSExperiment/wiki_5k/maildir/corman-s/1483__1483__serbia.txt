Ćirković, SRBI MEĐU EUROPSKIM NARODIMA,(Serbs) 2008. http://www.mo-vrebac-pavlovac.hr/attachments/article/451/Sima%20%C4%86irkovi%C4%87%20SRBI%20ME%C4%90U%20EVROPSKIM%20NARODIMA.pdf #page=26-27 The Serbs became Christian around the 10th century. For 200 years, the Nemanjić dynasty ruled. They made Serbia a kingdom, built new towns, monasteries, and forts, and made Serbia bigger. In 1371 the Nemanjic Dynasty died out. Serbia became unsafe and local leaders fought each other for control. After the Battle of Kosovo 1389 the Ottoman Empire fought the Serbs for 70 years until in 1459 the Ottoman Turks conquered Serbia and other Balkan countries. === Ottoman period === Once the Ottomans conquered Serbia, they got rid of the Serbian upper class. Most Serbs worked as farmers on land owned by Turks. They had to pay high taxes to the Turks. Some Serbs became Muslims. Serbs had their own laws in the Ottoman Empire through the millet system. The Christian Austrian Empire fought the Turks many times, including in the Great Turkish War of the late 17th Century. In 1718 Austria took northern Serbia and some other places. The last Austro-Turkish war was in 1781-1791. During the 19th century Serbia gradually became independent. During World War I Austria conquered Serbia but lost the bigger war. Serbia joined other Balkan countries to form Yugoslavia. ==Geography== Serbia is found in the Balkans and the Pannonian Plain. The Danube passes through Serbia.
