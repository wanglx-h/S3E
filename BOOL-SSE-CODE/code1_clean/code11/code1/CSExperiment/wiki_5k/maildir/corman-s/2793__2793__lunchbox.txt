File:Henkelmänner.jpg A '''lunchbox''' is used to carry a person's lunch. They can come in many shapes and sizes and by a number of manufacturers. They can also be in the form of a brown paper bag. The first aluminium lunch box was created in 1954 by a man by the name of Leo May when he happened to crush his tin lunch box. Category:Containers
