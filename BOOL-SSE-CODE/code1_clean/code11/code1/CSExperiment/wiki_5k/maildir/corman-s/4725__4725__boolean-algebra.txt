In mathematics, '''Boolean algebra''' is an algebra for Binary number digits (where 0 means false and 1 means true). It is equipped with three Operation (mathematics): conjunction (AND), disjunction (OR) and negation (NOT). It uses normal math symbols, but it does not work in the same way. It is named for George Boole, who invented it in the middle 19th century. Boolean algebra did not get much attention except from mathematicians until the 20th century when engineers began using it for logic gates. == NOT gate == {| class="wikitable" |- ! NOT |- | '''0''' | 1 |- | '''1''' | 0 |} The NOT operator is written with a bar over numbers or letters like this: :\bar{1} = 0 :\bar{0} = 1 :\bar{\mbox{A}} = \mbox{Q} It means that the output is ''not'' the input. == AND gate == {| class="wikitable" |- ! AND ! 0 ! 1 |- | '''0''' | 0 | 0 |- | '''1''' | 0 | 1 |} The AND operator is written as \cdot like this: :0 \cdot 0 = 0 :0 \cdot 1 = 0 :1 \cdot 0 = 0 :1 \cdot 1 = 1 The output is true if and only if one and the other input is true. == OR gate == {| class="wikitable" |- ! OR ! 0 ! 1 |- | '''0''' | 0 | 1 |- | '''1''' | 1 | 1 |} The OR operator is written as + like this: :0 + 0 = 0 :0 + 1 = 1 :1 + 0 = 1 :1 + 1 = 1 If one or the other input is true, then the output to be true (and false otherwise). == XOR gate == {| class="wikitable" |- ! XOR ! 0 ! 1 |- | '''0''' | 0 | 1 |- | '''1''' | 1 | 0 |} XOR basically means "exclusive or", meaning one input or the other must be true, but not both. The XOR operator is written as - like this: :0 - 0 = 0 :0 - 1 = 1 :1 - 0 = 1 :1 - 1 = 0 In other words, the XOR operator returns true precisely when one or the other input is true—but not both. == Identities == Different gates can be put together in different orders: :\overline{\mbox{A} \cdot \mbox{B}} is the same as an AND then a NOT. This is called a NAND gate. It is not the same as a NOT then an AND: \overline{\mbox{A}} \cdot \overline{\mbox{B}} :\mbox{A} + 1 = 1 :\mbox{A} \cdot 1 = \mbox{A} which is called ''AND identity table'' {| class="wikitable" |- bgcolor="#dddddd"| XAND !rowspan="1"| AND !width="1"| 1 !rowspan="1"| 0 !rowspan="1"| Any |- bgcolor="#eeeeee" |align="left" rowspan="1" | 1 |TRUE | 0 | 0 |- |- bgcolor="#dddddd" |align="left" rowspan="1" | 0 | 0 | 0 |\overline{ANY} |- |- bgcolor="#eeeeee" |align="center" rowspan="1"| Any | 0 | \overline{ANY} | \{Any\} |- |} , if ANY=\{x|\{x\}=\{\{TRUE\}\or\{\overline{TRUE}\}, \};\and (TRUE, 0) \vdash TRUE \and \overline{0} = \{x\}. or if ANY=\{x \|\{TRUE\}, \{\overline{TRUE}\} .\},=TRUE, TRUE., == De Morgan's laws == Augustus De Morgan discovered that it is possible to preserve the truth values of Boolean expression by changing a + sign to a \cdot sign, while making or breaking a bar. That is: :\overline{\mbox{A} + \mbox{B}} = \overline{\mbox {A}} \cdot \overline{\mbox{B}} :\overline{\mbox{A} \cdot \mbox{B}} = \overline{\mbox {A}} + \overline{\mbox{B}} These findings are commonly known as De Morgan's laws. ==Related pages== * Abstract algebra * Boolean data type * Boolean satisfiability problem * Fuzzy logic * Propositional logic ==References== ==Other websites== * [http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/vol_4/chpt_7/1.html Boolean algebra] on All About Circuits * [http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra Boolean algebra] Citizendium Category:Boolean algebra Category:Electronics
