File:Whole world - land and oceans 12000.jpg When people say "the '''world'''" they usually mean Earth, especially in a cultural and geopolitical sense. Human and all other known living things live in this world. Sometimes "world" means another planet. Before people discovered that Earth is a planet, they often used "World" to mean "Universe". They still sometimes use it to mean all humans or all civilization. Sometimes they mean a small part of Earth such as Western world, Islamic world, third world, new world or ancient world. == Related pages == * Universe Category:Geography
