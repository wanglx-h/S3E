Subject: Eastern Orthodox Church
The '''Eastern Orthodox Church''', officially the '''Orthodox Church''', is a Christianity Church (building). Their type of Christianity is also called '''Orthodox Christianity''' or '''Orthodoxy'''. Their members are called Orthodox Christians, while there is similar type of Christianity called the Oriental Orthodoxy, whose churches are not in communion with the Eastern Orthodox Church. ==Overview== There are about 300 million Orthodox Christians in the world. Most Orthodox Christians are found in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. The Eastern Orthodox Church teaches that it is the Church started by Jesus Christ in his instructions to the Twelve apostles. It practices what it understands to be the original Christian faith and maintains the sacred tradition passed down from the apostles. The worship service is known as the ''Divine Liturgy''. The beliefs and rituals of the service are similar to the Eucharist in the Roman Catholic Church. ==History== In 395, the Roman Empire was split into a western part and an eastern part. The western part lasted to the 5th or 6th century. Τhe exact dates are a point of debate. The eastern part, which is commonly called Byzantine Empire, lasted until the 15th century. The split of the Roman Empire also affected the church, which developed differently in both parts. ===East-West Schism=== In 1054, there was the East-West Schism. The western part developed what is now the Roman Catholicism, and the eastern part is now called Eastern Orthodox Church. In Western Europe, there is the Patriarch of Rome, who is commonly called the Pope. In Eastern Europe, there is the Patriarch of Constantinople. Because of such historical development, many Eastern Orthodox churches also have a local Patriarch. In the west, the Pope is an absolutism leader. The Patriarch of Constantinople is the "first among equals". His power is not absolute, as seen when meeting with other Patriarchs. His power is the same of all bishops.File:East-Ortho-cross.svg ==Doctrines== Some holidays include Christmas and Easter. Orthodox believe in everything in the Nicene Creed: :''I believe in one God, the Father, the Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth and of all things visible and invisible.'' :''And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, begotten of the Father before all ages.'' :''Light of Light, true God of true God, begotten not created, of one essence with the Father through whom all things were made.'' :''For us men and for our salvation He came down from heaven and was incarnate with the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary and became man.'' :''He was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate, and He suffered and was buried.'' :''On the third day He rose according to the Scriptures.'' :''He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father.'' :''He will come again in glory to judge the living and dead. His kingdom shall have no end.'' :''And in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the Giver of life, who proceeds from the Father, who together with the Father and the Son is worshiped and glorified, who spoke through the prophets.'' :''In One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church.'' :''I acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.'' :''I expect the resurrection of the dead.'' :''And the life of the ages to come. Amen.'' :In summary, they believe in one God, who consists of three Persons (Father, Son & Spirit) who are one and the same (of one essence). As the Son (Jesus), He arrived from Heaven, died, and resurrected. He will eventually return as a Judge for all of humanity, as described in the Bible. ==Today== File:World Eastern Orthodox population.pngThe many churches of the Orthodox Church are distinct in terms of administration and local culture, but for the most part exist in full communion with one another.
