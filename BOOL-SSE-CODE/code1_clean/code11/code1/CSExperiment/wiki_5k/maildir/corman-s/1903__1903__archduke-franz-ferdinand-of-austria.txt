He then went home and hid his gun and bomb but was later arrested.

He jumped into the Miljacka River but failed to die and so he got arrested. The Archduke was shocked but headed to the Town Hall anyway and did his speech. The paper was covered in the blood of an assistant, who had been injured in the bomb. After his speech he decided to go to the hospital to visit the 20 people injured in the bomb. As the driver took a turn to head to the hospital, Princip jumped out and shot Sophie in the abdomen.She collapsed and died instantly then shot the Archduke in his neck and in his leg. Franz Ferdinand died on the way to the hospital after his last last words: “Sophie! Sophie! Don’t die! For our children!
