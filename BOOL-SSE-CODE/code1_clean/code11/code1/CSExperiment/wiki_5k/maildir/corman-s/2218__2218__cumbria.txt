It is in the very north-western part of England on the border with Scotland. The most important and biggest town is Carlisle, in the north of the county. This is the county town and there is an ancient (very old) castle in the centre of the town. In 1974, Cumberland, Westmorland and bits of Yorkshire and Lancashire were put into the new county of Cumbria. The world famous Lake District national park is in Cumbria. Millions of tourists visit the Lake District to enjoy sailing on the lakes and the impressive mountains that are here. The highest mountain in England is in the Lake District, it is called Scafell Pike. Cumbria is very popular with people who enjoy walking although the weather is very poor here. It often rains and is cold. Many tourists from Japan and China visit Cumbria. Popular places for them and other tourists to see are the poet William Wordsworth's two houses, the home of the famous children's writer Beatrix Potter and the island and lake where the writer Arthur Ransome based his books about the 'Swallows And Amazons'. == Other websites == * [http://www.cumbria-the-lake-district.co.uk/ Official Tourist Board Website] * [http://www.visitcumbria.com/index.htm Cumbria Tourist and Historical Website] * [http://www.bbc.co.uk/cumbria/digital_lives/index.shtml BBC Cumbria Digital Lives Project] * [http://www.cumbria.uk.com Cumbria.uk.com Search Engine] * [http://www.thecumbriadirectory.com/ The Cumbria Directory] Category:Ceremonial counties of England Category:Cumbria Category:1974 establishments in England
