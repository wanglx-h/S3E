File:Jiao zi.jpg '''Currency''' is a unit of money used for buying and selling Product (consumer goods) and services, commonly backed by a country or a union of countries. Some currencies are "pegged" or "fixed" to something, like another currency. These currencies have a constant value compared to what it is pegged to. For example, the Cape Verde escudo is pegged to the Euro. This means that any changes in the value of the Euro equally affect the escudo. Some currencies are pegged to a commodity, like gold or silver rather than to another currency. This was called the "gold standard" or "silver standard". Most countries stopped using silver and gold standards in the 20th century. Some well-known currencies are: * the United States dollar * the Euro * the Pound sterling ==Names of different currencies around the world== This list appears in alphabetical order: * Afghan afghani - Afghanistan * Baht - Thailand * Balboa (currency) - Panama (United States dollar used for paper money) * Ethiopian birr - Ethiopia * Venezuelan bolívar - Venezuela * Boliviano - Bolivia * Cedi - Ghana * Costa Rican colón - Costa Rica * Cordoba (currency) - Nicaragua * Crown - Czech Republic (koruna), Denmark (Danish krone), Iceland (króna), Norway (Norwegian krone), Sweden (krona).
