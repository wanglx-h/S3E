To '''chat''' is to '''talk''' about ordinary things that are not usually very important. However, important issues can also classify as “chat”, for instance when organising gatherings, meetings or events, such as air show attendance. A person can chat with another person, or to many people. People also use this word now for parts of the Internet where we can talk with many different people at the same time. Usually, people chat on the Internet in a chat room or instant messaging service like AOL (AIM), Yahoo! Windows Live Messenger or Tencent QQ. There are also programs which let people use different messaging services from one program, such as Pidgin (software). Online Chat is real time, text-based, digital communication between two or more parties. ==Related pages== * Internet Relay Chat (IRC) * Conversation Category:Communication Category:Internet communication Category:Messaging
