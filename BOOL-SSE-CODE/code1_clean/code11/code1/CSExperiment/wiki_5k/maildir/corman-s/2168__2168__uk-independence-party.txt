Its policies promote conservatism, national conservatism, and Euroscepticism. The party was founded in 1993, and they first won seats in the European Parliament in 1999. They won 3 seats in 1999, which was increased to 12 in 2004 and 13 in 2009. It is now 9. The party does not do well under Britain's 'First-past-the-post' system of elections and only had one seat in the British House of Commons, although they received 3.8 million votes (12.6% of the total vote) at the 2015 UK general election. Ukip suffered a complete loss of its remaining council seats in the May 2023 local elections, leaving it without any representation at any level. Supporters of UKIP mostly believe in the following things: * The United Kingdom should leave the European Union. * There should be more referendums on certain issues. * British people should not have to carry ID cards. In 2008 UKIP banned people who used to be members of the British National Party from joining. However, in 2022/23, this ban was lifted by the current party chair, Ben Walker. Instead, a ban on various left-wing organisations and environmentalist groups was enacted. On 9 October 2014 Douglas Carswell became UKIP's first elected MP. Carswell quit the party in March 2017. In 2020, UKIP had a total of 3,888 members but as of 2024, various reports indicate that UKIP’s membership has dwindled even further. ==May 2014 local elections== In the May 2014 local elections UKIP got 30% of the vote in Sunderland.
