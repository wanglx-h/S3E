It has a population of around 1,750,000 people. It is part of the East of England region. Chelmsford is the county town of Essex, as well as being one of three cities in the county alongside Colchester, known to be Britain (place name)'s first city''',''' and Southend-on-Sea, one of the country's biggest seaside resorts. Essex has Greater London and Hertfordshire on its western border and the whole of the east of the county is Coast. The north of the county borders Suffolk and Cambridgeshire. The south of the county is on the Thames Estuary. The Dartford Tunnel can be used to drive under the River Thames between Essex and Kent. Other large towns in Essex include Basildon, Braintree and Harwich. There has been lots of recent debate about whether certain sections of East London should be included as parts of Essex, such as Ilford and Romford. Due to boundary changes across the years, these areas were historically in Essex but have been dissolved into the Greater London area since. == Related pages == * Kingdom of Essex == Other websites == Category:Essex Category:Ceremonial counties of England
