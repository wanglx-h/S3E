'''''Star Trek''''' is an American media franchise owned by Paramount Pictures and CBS, as well as various spin-offs. The main parts of the ''Star Trek'' franchise are: * Seven television series (first shown from 1966 to today) and * Thirteen movies (shown in theaters from 1980 to 2016). Other parts of the franchise are: books (both fiction and non-fiction), magazines, comics, action figures, scale model and computer video games. ''Star Trek'' was created as a TV series in 1966 by Gene Roddenberry. He and the other authors of ''Star Trek'' have, over time, developed a whole fictional universe set in the future. Following this fictional universe is the way they have chosen to maintain continuity between the various TV series and the movies. ''Trekkies'' or ''Trekkers'' may refer to the many fanatic who love the series and support this ''Star Trek Universe''. Many conventions and newsletters exist to serve these fans. There are even amateur movies made by the fans. == Creation == In the 1960s, Gene Roddenberry created ''Star Trek''. He sold it as a Western (genre) (a television genre about cowboys), but in Outer space, and compared it to the television show ''Wagon Train''.[http://www.ex-astris-scientia.org/misc/40_years/trek_pitch.pdf Star Trek first draft] - created by Gene Roddenberry. URL accessed March 08, 2009 He also based it on ''Gulliver's Travels''. After two pilots (test episodes), ''Star Trek'' was first shown on television in 1966. == History of ''Star Trek'' == In 2053, World War III ended on Earth. In 2063 Zefram Cochrane, invented the Warp technology, a way to travel faster than the speed of light. Because of this invention, Vulcan (Star Trek)s came to Earth to meet the humans. This is shown in ''Star Trek: First Contact''. The Vulcans helped humans fight disease and hunger. In 2150 humans created a United Earth Government that combined all the old governments into one. A war between Earth and the Romulans made species from different planets work together, and the Coalition of Planets was started in 2156. In 2161, the planets Vulcan, Earth, Andoria and Tellar started the United Federation of Planets. == Television series == === ''The Original Series'' (1966–1969) === ''Star Trek: The Original Series'' is sometimes abbreviated to TOS. In it, the Starship Enterprise travels through space to discover new places - "to boldly go where no man has gone before". The show was set in the 23rd century. The main characters are: * Captain James Tiberius Kirk, played by William Shatner * Spock, played by Leonard Nimoy * Dr. Leonard McCoy, played by DeForest Kelley * Scotty (Star Trek), played by James Doohan * Uhura, played by Nichelle Nichols * Hikaru Sulu, played by George Takei * Pavel Chekov, played by Walter Koenig It was shown on television for three years. It was cancelled in 1969. === ''The Animated Series'' (1973–1974) === ''Star Trek: The Animated Series'' is also called ''TAS''. It is an animation version of ''The Original Series''. The crew are the same, and most are Actor#Voice acting by the same actors. Because it was animated, the planets and species could look more interesting. Gene Roddenberry asked for the stories in ''TAS'' to be removed from ''Star Trek'''s canon (the official history of ''Star Trek'' that is the same in all series). It is still argued about if they are part of canon or not, but usually agreed that they are not. The [http://www.startrek.com/ official Star Trek website] has added some things from ''TAS'' to their library.[http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/features/specials/article/66895.html The ''Animated Series'' Gets Real] - URL accessed 10th March, 2009. === ''The Next Generation'' (1987–1994) === ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' is also called ''TNG''. It is set 70 years after ''The Original Series'', in the 24th century. The crew travel on a new Spacecraft called the "Enterprise-D". The stories are also about exploring, and often about fighting hostile (violent or angry) ships. The crew has many different races. The main characters are: * Captain Jean-Luc Picard, played by Patrick Stewart * Commander William Riker, played by Jonathon Frakes * Data (Star Trek) (an android (robot)), played by Brent Spiner * Dr. Beverly Crusher, played by Gates McFadden * Worf (a Klingon), played by Michael Dorn * Geordi La Forge, played by LeVar Burton * Counselor Deanna Troi, played by Marina Sirtis * Wesley Crusher, played by Wil Wheaton It was shown on television for seven seasons, from 1987 to 1994. === ''Deep Space Nine'' (1993–1999) === ''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'' is also sometimes called ''DS9''. It is set in the late 24th century, at the end of ''The Next Generation'''s time line and the start of Voyager's. It is not like ''TOS'' and ''TNG'' because it is set on a space station and is not about exploring. This means it has more soap opera elements (lots of stories about the characters). Most of the stories are about the Cardassian race and the war with the Dominion. The main characters are: * Captain Benjamin Sisko (Commander for seasons 1 to 3), played by Avery Brooks * Major Kira Nerys, played by Nana Visitor * Odo, played by Rene Auberjonois * Jadzia Dax, played by Terry Farrell * Ezri Dax, played by Nicole de Boer * Worf, played by Michael Dorn * Miles O'Brien, played by Colm Meaney * Quark (Star Trek), played by Armin Shimerman It was shown on television for seven seasons, from 1993 to 1999. === ''Voyager'' (1995–2001) === ''Star Trek: Voyager'' is set in the late 24th century. It is different from the other series because it takes place in the Delta Quadrant. The Spacecraft Voyager was trapped there after a chase by the Maquis (Starfleet Rebellious). The stories are about them trying to find their way home. This is a long journey, and will take them 75 years. The main characters are: * Captain Kathryn Janeway, played by Kate Mulgrew * Chakotay, played by Robert Beltran * Tuvok, played by Tim Russ * B'Elanna Torres, played by Roxann Dawson * Tom Paris, played by Robert Duncan McNeill * Harry Kim, played by Garrett Wang * The Doctor (Star Trek), played by Robert Picardo * Seven of Nine, played by Jeri Ryan It was shown on television for seven seasons, from 1995 to 2001. It was made to help start a new television channel, UPN. === ''Enterprise'' (2001–2005) === ''Star Trek: Enterprise'' is set in the 22nd century, which means it is before all the other series on the ''Star Trek'' timeline. It is about the humans and the Vulcans working together after first contact. The Spacecraft, Enterprise, was the first Warp technology ship made by the humans (with some Vulcan assistance). The first season famously had many continuity errors (events and technology that did not match what happens in the other series).[http://www.ex-astris-scientia.org/inconsistencies/enterprise_continuity.htm Ex Astris Scientia] URL accessed 11 March, 2009 The main characters are: * Captain Jonathan Archer, played by Scott Bakula * T'Pol, played by Jolene Blalock * Charles "Trip" Tucker, played by Connor Trinneer * Malcolm Reed, played by Dominic Keating * Hoshi Sato, played by Linda Park * Travis Mayweather, played by Anthony Montgomery * Dr. Phlox, played by John Billingsley It was shown on television for four seasons, from 2001 to 2005. === ''Discovery'' (2017-) === ''Star Trek: Discovery'' is the newest ''Star Trek'' series. It is set in the 23rd century, ten years before the original ''Star Trek'' series. The first season is about a war between the Federation and the Klingons.

In no particular order, they are: * Strange New Worlds * Lower Decks * Short Treks * Very Short Treks (described as "anything but canon" in its own trailers) * Prodigy * Picard == Movies == {| class=wikitable !No. !Title !Year !Crew !Director |- |I || ''Star Trek: The Motion Picture'' || 1979 in movies || Star Trek: The Original Series || Robert Wise |- |II || ''Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan'' || 1982 in movies || The Original Series || Nicholas Meyer |- |III || ''Star Trek III: The Search for Spock'' || 1984 in movies || The Original Series || Leonard Nimoy |- |IV || ''Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home'' || 1986 in movies || The Original Series || Leonard Nimoy |- |V || ''Star Trek V: The Final Frontier'' || 1989 in movies || The Original Series || William Shatner |- |VI ||style="white-space: nowrap;"| ''Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country'' || 1991 in movies || The Original Series || Nicholas Meyer |- |VII || ''Star Trek: Generations'' || 1994 in movies || Star Trek: The Next Generation || David Carson (director) |- |VIII || ''Star Trek: First Contact'' || 1996 in movies || The Next Generation || Jonathan Frakes |- |IX || ''Star Trek: Insurrection'' || 1998 in movies || The Next Generation || Jonathan Frakes |- |X || ''Star Trek: Nemesis'' || 2002 in movies || The Next Generation || Stuart Baird |- |XI || ''Star Trek (2009)'' || 2009 in movies || The Original Series || Jeffrey Jacob Abrams |- |XII || ''Star Trek Into Darkness'' || 2013 in movies || The Original Series || Jeffrey Jacob Abrams |- |XIII || ''Star Trek Beyond'' || 2016 in movies || The Original Series || Justin Lin |- |XIV || ''Star Trek: Section 31'' || 2025 in movies || || Olatunde Osunsanmi |} == Culture == The ''Star Trek'' franchising is a multibillion-dollar industry (a very large business). It has influenced (affected) many things in real life. === Trekkies === ''Star Trek'' has a large following of fans who are very :wikt:enthusiastic (care a great deal) about the show. They are usually called '''Trekkies'''. The word was first used by Arthur W. Saha when he saw people wearing fake Vulcan ears at a convention (an event where lots of people interested in the same thing organise to meet) in 1967.[http://www.sciencefictionbuzz.com/startrekclassic.html Star Trek Classic on Science Fiction Buzz] - URL accessed 14 March, 2009 Some fans like to be known as '''Trekkers''' instead. Two documentaries (factual television shows) have been made about them, called ''Trekkies'' and ''Trekkies 2''. === Enterprise === In 1976, NASA made a prototype (test) space shuttle. It was first going to be called ''Constitution'', but Star Trek fans wrote letters to NASA asking for it to be called ''Enterprise'' instead. ''Enterprise'' was used for flight tests, although it was never sent into space. It is now displayed (put on show) at the Smithsonian Institution.[http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/resources/orbiters/enterprise.html Shuttle Orbiter Enterprise (OV-101)] - URL accessed 11 March, 2009 === Parodies and tributes === The movie ''Galaxy Quest'' is a ''Star Trek'' parody, which means it was made to be like ''Star Trek'' in a funny way. There have been parodies on television in the cartoons ''Futurama'', ''The Simpsons'' and ''Family Guy''. The video games company Blizzard Entertainment puts references to ''Star Trek'' in many of its games, like ''Starcraft'' and ''World of Warcraft''. Fans of the show made a new episode, ''Pilgrim of Eternity'', in 2013. The crew were also professional film and TV people. == Themes == ''Star Trek'' episodes often tell a moral story. Philosophy and morality questions are common. In the ''Star Trek: Voyager'' episode "Tuvix", a transporter accident puts two characters, Tuvok and Neelix, into one body. This makes a new person, Tuvix, who has his own wikt:simple:personality. The crew of the Voyager must decide what to do: they can kill Tuvix by separating him back into Tuvok and Neelix, or they can kill Tuvok and Neelix by letting Tuvix live. In the end, Captain Janeway decides to save Tuvok and Neelix, although the Doctor thinks this is wrong. ''Star Trek'' episodes also often reflect (copy) what is happening in the real world. One example is the episode "A Private Little War" in ''Star Trek: The Original Series''. This is said to be like the Vietnam War.[http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/st/interviews/justman/page4.shtml BBC Interview with Robert H. Justman] - URL accessed 11 March, 2009 In the episode, the Klingons threaten innocent people. Captain Kirk has to decide whether to give the people guns so that they can defend themselves. The episode asks whether you can fight evil without doing evil yourself. One focus of all the ''Star Trek'' franchises is a Federation law called "The Prime Directive." The Prime Directive states that advanced civilizations should not change more primitive ones; societies should be allowed to develop on their own. The Prime Directive often makes for a moral conflictfor example, the Prime Directive might forbid using advanced technology to save an intelligent race. == References == == Other websites == *[http://www.startrek.com StarTrek.com]—The Official Star Trek website *[http://www.memory-alpha.org/en/index.php/Main_Page Memory Alpha]—A Star Trek encyclopedia that uses information ''only'' from canon (official history) *[http://startrek.wikia.com Memory Beta]—A Star Trek encyclopedia that uses information from ''both'' canon and non-canon sources Category:Star Trek Category:Fictional universes Category:Science fiction Category:Media franchises
