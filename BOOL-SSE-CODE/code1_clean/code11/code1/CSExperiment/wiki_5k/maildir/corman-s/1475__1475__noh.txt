It started in the 14th century and continues today. Noh is made up of ''mai'' (dances), ''hayashi'' (music) and ''utai'' (words usually in songs). The performers use masks and dance slowly. Zeami and his father Kan'ami brought Noh to its present-day form during the Muromachi period. == Types of Noh drama == Theater pieces of Noh are classified into 5 groups. * Divine; the hero or heroine is divine like a god, heavenly people, and so on. The hero or heroine makes a benediction at the end of the drama. * ''Shura-mono'' (Warrior); the hero (rarely heroine) is a warrior, usually already dead. * ''Kazura-mono'' (Women); the heroine and often her love romance is the focus. * ''Zatsu-no'' (Miscellaneous); Noh which cannot be placed in the other four groups. * ''Oni-noh'' (''Oni''; demons) ; Non-humans, like ''oni'', ''tengu'' (fairy, lion), are the heroes of this type. Mainly it is played at the end of the program. == Noh players == All Noh players are man. They have been taught their skills by their fathers. When a woman or girl appears in the drama, a male actor plays her role with a woman mask. There are three types of Noh players: ''shite'', ''waki'' and ''kyogen''. ''Shite'' plays the hero or the heroine. He talks sings and dances. ''Waki'' (meaning "Side") and plays the sidekick of ''Shite''. The Waki usually plays the role of a traveler role. He introduces us to the world in the drama. ''Kyogen'' appears in the middle of the drama if it has two parts, and plays the role of the local citizen. He talks to ''Waki'' and makes him notice something new or realize what has happened. == Music on Noh == ''Hayashi'' means musical instrumentals. Two kinds of drum (''Tuzumi'', ''Taiko'') and a flute (''Fue'') are used in the theater. == References == Category:Japanese music Category:Theatrical forms Category:Japanese plays
