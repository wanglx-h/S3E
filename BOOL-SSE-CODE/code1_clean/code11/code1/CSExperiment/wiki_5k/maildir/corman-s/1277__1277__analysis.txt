The technique has been applied in the study of mathematics and logic since before Aristotle (384–322 Before Christ), though ''analysis'' as a formal concept is a relatively recent development. The word comes from the Ancient Greek ἀνάλυσις (''analusis'', "a breaking up", from ''ana-'' "up, throughout" and ''lysis'' "a loosening"). In this context, Analysis is the opposite of synthesis, which is to bring ideas together. The following concepts are closely related to this basic idea: * Mathematical analysis is the name given to any branch of mathematics that looks at what Function (mathematics) are, how they behave, and what things can be done with them. * Analytical chemistry looks at the qualities of substances, and their composition. == Some definitions == #The process of breaking up a concept, proposition, or fact into its simple or ultimate constituents.

Geometry assumes a proposition to be true and searches for another known truth from which the proposition may be deduced. Physical science resolves complex wholes into their elements.
