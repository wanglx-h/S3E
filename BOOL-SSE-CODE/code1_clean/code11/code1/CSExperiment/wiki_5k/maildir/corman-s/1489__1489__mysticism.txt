People who practice these beliefs are called ''mystics''. Mystics exist within most religions, though not all people who practice religions are mystics. Mystics may experience visions or dreams, or hear God as a voice. ==Hindu mystics== Some examples of Hinduism mystics: :Adi Sankara :Ramakrishna Paramhansa ==Christian mystics== Some examples of Christianity mystics: :Augustine of Hippo (354–430) :Pope Gregory I (590–604) :Bridget of Sweden (1303–1373) :John of the Cross (1542–1591) :George Fox (1624–1691) :William Blake (1757–1827) :Thomas Merton (1915–1968) ==Islamic mystics== Islam Mysticism is known as ''Tassawuf'' (or Sufism).
