Image: Brass.jpg '''Brass''' is an alloy of copper and zinc. Some types of brass are called bronzes. Brass has a golden appearance. It is harder than pure metals and resists corrosion. It costs more than zinc. There are some common brasses: * Alpha brasses - with less than 40% zinc * Beta brasses - * White brasses - with more than 45% zinc Things brass are used to make include: * Brass instruments * Ornaments * Electricity fittings * Buttons * Screws * Tap (valve)s * Hinges * Door handle ==Properties== Brass is more malleable than bronze or zinc. The melting point of brass can be 900 to 940 °C or 1,650 to 1,720 °F, depending on what it is made of. The density of brass is 8.4 to 8.73 g/cm3 (0.303 to 0.315 lb/cu in). Today, almost 90% of all brass Alloy are Recycling. Brass is not Ferromagnetism. Brass scrap is collected and Transport to the foundry. In the foundry, it is melted and recast into Billet. The billets are heated and stretched into the form and size that is wanted. Brass will corrode when it is exposed to moisture, Chloride, Acetate, ammonia, and some Acid. == Brass alloys == There are many brass alloys. They include: * Abyssinian gold * Admiralty brass * Aich's alloy * Aluminum brass * Arsenical brass * Cartridge brass * Common brass * DZR brass * Delta metal * Free machining brass * Gilding metal * High brass * Leaded brass * Lead-free brass * Low brass * Manganese brass * Muntz metal * Naval brass * Nickel brass * Nordic gold * Orichalcum * Prince's metal * Red brass * Tombac * Silicon tombac * Tonval brass * Yellow brass == References == Category:Copper alloys Category:Zinc alloys Category:Basic English 850 words
