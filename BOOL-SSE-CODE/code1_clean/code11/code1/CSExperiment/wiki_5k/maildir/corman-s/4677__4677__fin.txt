The word was first used for the limbs of fish, but it is now also used to mean other animal limbs and human-made devices. The fins of fish are called: *'''Dorsal fin''' on the back. These fins keep the fish from rolling over. *'''Caudal''' or tail fin. This fin pushes the fish forward in the water. *'''Pectoral fins''' (paired). These fins help the fish steer. *'''Pelvic fin''' (paired). These fins help the fish steer. *'''Anal fin''': stability Category:Animal anatomy
