It is Israel's second largest city and main commerce, financial, industrial and cultural center. It is on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea. As of 2024, there are 4.4 million people living in Tel Aviv. Tel Aviv is a part of an area of cities called Gush Dan, which is the largest metropolitan area of Israel. There is around 3.4 million people living in this urban area. ==History== In 1909, Jew started building Tel Aviv northeast of Jaffa, making it the first city founded by Jews in modern times. Tel Aviv was part of Jaffa at first, but it became a separate town in 1921. Tel Aviv grew quickly as Jewish immigrants arrived, mainly from Europe. Between the years 1925-1929 the Scottish people city planner Sir Patrick Geddes designed the Geddes Plan for Tel Aviv. In the early 1930s the area of the Yarkon River mouth began to develop with the opening of the international trade fair - the "Orient Fair" and the opening of the "Tel Aviv Port" alongside it. From the other side of the Yarkon River, the Reading Power Station and the Sde Dov Airport were built. It was Israel's first capital (city) when the nation was established in 1948. The capital was moved to Jerusalem in 1949, but the Israeli Ministry of Defense and many foreign embassy stayed in Tel Aviv. Most Israeli ministry (government department) that are located in Jerusalem have offices in Tel Aviv. The national intelligence agency of Israel, Mossad (external security), Military Intelligence Directorate (Israel) (military intelligence) and Shin Bet (internal security) also have their headquarters in Tel Aviv. In 1950, Tel Aviv and Jaffa (called ''Yafo'' in Hebrew) joined to create the city of Tel Aviv-Yafo. Tel Aviv-Yafo is the wikt:official name of the city, but it is almost always called Tel Aviv. Tel Aviv continued to grow quickly in the 1950s and 1960s. The fast growth of the Tel Aviv area caused problems such as air pollution, slums, and traffic that took until the 2000s to fix. Traffic is still a problem. That is why the Tel Aviv Light Rail is being built to ease the road traffic. Most of the people of Tel Aviv live in apartment buildings. During the Gulf War of 1991, Iraq fired about 25 missiles toward Tel Aviv. Several missiles and falling wikt:debris struck residential areas in or around Tel Aviv. Two people were killed, and about 7,500 apartments were damaged. ==Cultural life== The culture center of Tel Aviv is a downtown intersection of streets at Dizengoff Circle. Fashionable shops and sidewalk cafes line the nearby streets. The 37-story Shalom Tower is in the city's finance wikt:district, several blocks south of Dizengoff Circle.
