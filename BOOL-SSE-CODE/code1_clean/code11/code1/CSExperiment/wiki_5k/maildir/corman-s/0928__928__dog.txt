They were the first animals to live with humans.Irving-Pease, Evan K.; Ryan, Hannah; Jamieson, Alexandra; Dimopoulos, Evangelos A.; Larson, Greger; Frantz, Laurent A.F. 2018. Paleogenomics of Animal Domestication. In Lindqvist, C.; Rajora, O. (eds) ''Paleogenomics. Population Genomics''. Springer, Cham. pp. 225–272. doi:10.1007/13836_2018_55. ISBN 978-3-030-04752-8 There was a lot of different types among wolves in the Late Pleistocene. The dingo is also a dog, but many dingos have become wild animals again and live in the wild, away from humans (parts of Australia). Today, some dogs are used as pets, and others are used to help humans do their work. They are popular pets because they are usually playful, friendly, loyal, and listen to humans. Thirty million dogs in the United States have been wikt:register as pets. Dogs eat both meat and vegetables. Often mixed together and sold in stores as dog food. Dogs often have jobs including police dogs, army dogs, assistance dogs, fire dogs, messenger dogs, hunting dogs, herding dogs, or rescue dogs. They are sometimes called "canines" from the Latin language word for dog - ''canis''. wolf are also canines. A baby dog is called a '''pup''' or '''puppy'''. A dog is called a puppy until it is about one year old. Dogs are sometimes known as "human's best friend" because they are kept as pets, are usually loyal, and like being around humans. Dogs like to be petted, but only when they can first see the petter's hand before being petted. August 26 is National Dog Day worldwide.[https://www.nationaldogday.com/ National Dog Day &#124; Celebrating Dogs] While March 23 is National Puppy Day in the United States. == Appearance and behaviour == Dogs can smell and hear better than humans but cannot see well in color because they are color blindness. Due to the structure of their eyes, dogs can see better in low light than humans. They also have a larger field of vision. Like wolves, wild dogs travel in groups called pack (canine). Packs of dogs are listed by rank, and dogs with low rank will submit to other dogs with a higher rank. The highest ranked dog is called the alpha male. A dog in a group helps and cares for others. Pet dogs often view their owner as the alpha male. == Lifespan of dogs == File:Dog and human year graph(fixed).png Different dog breeds have different lifespans. In general, smaller dogs live longer than bigger ones. The size and the breed of the dog change how long the dog lives on average. Breeds such as the Dachshund usually live for fifteen years, Chihuahua (dog) can reach the age of twenty. On the other hand, the Great Dane has an average lifespan of six to eight years; some Great Danes have lived for as long as ten years. An American Bulldog lives for around 15 years. Bigger dogs will have smaller lives than smaller dogs because of the pressure on its heart to move around. ==Anatomy== ===Size and skeleton=== Dogs come in a wide range of sizes, from very large breeds like the Great Dane weighing 50-79 kilogram and measuring 71-81 cm, to very small breeds like the Chihuahua weighing 0.5-3 kg and measuring 13-20 cm. Regardless of size, all healthy dogs have a similar bone structure, except for their tails. There are variations in the skeletal structure among different types of dogs. The dog's skeleton is well-suited for running, with neck and back vertebrae having extensions for back muscles, ribs providing space for the heart and lungs, and flexible shoulders. Selective breeding over time has led to larger skeletons in breeds like smaller skeletons in breeds like terriers. Most dogs have 26 vertebrae in their tails, but some naturally have as few as three. The dog's skull has consistent components across breeds but varies in shape. == Dogs and humans == Dogs are often called "man's best friend" because they fit in with human life. Dogs can serve people in many ways. For example, there are guard dogs, hunting dogs, Sheepdog, guide dogs for blind people, and police dogs. There are also dogs that are trained to smell for diseases in the human body or to find bombs or illegal drugs. These dogs sometimes help police in airports or other areas. Sniffer dogs (usually beagles) are sometimes trained for this job. Dogs have even been sent by Russians into outer space, a few years before any human being. The first dog sent up was named Laika, but she died within a few hours. There is much more variety in dogs than in cats. That is mainly because of the way humans have selected and bred dogs for specific jobs and functions. It may also have something to do with the fact that dogs are pack animals, whereas cats are not.

There are over 450 recognized dog breeds, according to the American Kennel Club. Dogs started to become more diverse during the Victorian era when humans began controlling which dogs were bred. Most breeds come from a small number of original dogs from the last 200 years. Since then, dogs have changed quickly in appearance and have been selectively bred by people. The differences in skull shape, body size, and limb length between breeds are greater than those found in all carnivores combined. These breeds have unique features like body size, skull shape, tail type, fur texture, and color.
