'''Poetry''' is written, spoken or sung language that is used in stronger or more original ways than prose is used. Poetry uses the ''Meaning'' of words as prose does; but it also uses the ''Sound'' of words as if they were music, especially Rhyme, other repeating sounds, and Rhythm (Tempo or Meter (poetry))."poetry". Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms (4 ed.), OUP 2015. Online access via Wikipedia Library 2 January 2023. Poetry arranges words and groups of words to make Repetition and Parallelism (grammar). Poetry uses Figure of speech, Ellipsis and delayed identifications to suggest that there is more meaning in the language. Some people believe that poetry began when language began. They think it is probably "as old as history and older, present wherever religion is present."
