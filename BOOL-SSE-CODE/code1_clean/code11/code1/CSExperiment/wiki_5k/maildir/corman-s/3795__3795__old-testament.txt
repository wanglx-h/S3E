File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 079.jpg]] In Christianity, the '''Old Testament''' is the name of the first part of the Bible which was completed before Jesus Christ was born. Scholars prefer the term Hebrew Bible. Tertullian was probably the first person to call these books the "Old Testament." He used the Latin language name ''vetus testamentum'' in the 2nd century. The collection contains different texts, called "books", about God, and the people of Israel. It can be divided into several sections: the Torah, the Books of Chronicles, the Prophets and Wisdom books. In Judaism, this collection of books is known as Tanakh because it is divided into three parts (Torah, Nevi'im and Ketuvim). Most Jews and many Christians believe these texts to be holy. According to them, God inspired people to write them. Different religious communities include (or leave out) certain books from the Old Testament. The Catholic Church uses Saint Jerome's Latin translation of the Old Testament called Vulgate. The Eastern Orthodox church uses the ancient Greek translation of Jewish sacred writings called the Septuagint. The Eastern Orthodox list of sacred books has a few more books than the Roman Catholic list. Protestantism Bibles stick more closely to the books in the Tanakh but list them in a different order. == Themes == In the Old Testament, Almighty God is the one who created the world. The God of the Old Testament is not always presented as Monotheism, even though there may be other gods, the God of the Old Testament is always shown as the only God whom Israel is to worship. The God of the Old Testament is the one "true God"; only Yahweh is Almighty. Both Jews and Christians have always interpreted the Bible (both the "Old" and "New" Testaments) as an affirmation of the oneness of Almighty God.Barton, John 1997. ''How the Bible came to be''. Westminster John Knox Press. ISBN 978-0-664-25785-9, p=9 The Old Testament stresses the special relationship between God and his chosen people, Israel, but includes instructions for proselytes as well. This relationship is expressed in the biblical covenant (contract) between the two, received by Moses. The law codes in books such as Book of Exodus and especially Deuteronomy are the terms of the contract: Israel swears faithfulness to Tetragrammaton, and God swears to be Israel's special protector and supporter. ''The Jewish Study Bible'' denies that covenant means contract. Other themes in the Old Testament include salvation, Redemption (theology), Deity judgment, obedience and disobedience, faith and faithfulness. Throughout there is a strong emphasis on ethics and ritual purity. God demands both. According to the Old Testament, it is important to be wikt:fair and to help those who are vulnerable. Those in power should not be biased when they judge people. The Old Testament forbids corruption, wikt:deceive people when Trade. It is also against some sexual practices, which are seen as sinful. All morality is traced back to God, who is the source of all goodness. The problem of evil plays a large part in the Old Testament. The problem the Old Testament authors faced was that a good God must have had just reason for bringing disaster (meaning notably, but not only, the Babylonian exile) upon his people. The theme is played out, with many variations, in books as different as the histories of Kings and Chronicles, the prophets like Ezekiel and Jeremiah, and in the wisdom books like Job and Ecclesiastes. == Books in the Old Testament == ===The Torah, or "Books of Moses"=== #Book of Genesis (50 Chapters) #Book of Exodus (40 Chapters) #Leviticus (27 Chapters) # Book of Numbers (36 Chapters) #Deuteronomy (34 Chapters) ===Historical books=== #Book of Joshua (24 Chapters) #Book of Judges (21 Chapters) # Book of Ruth (4 chapters) # Book of 1 Samuel (31 Chapters) # Books of Samuel (24 Chapters) # Books of Kings (22 Chapters) # Books of Kings (25 Chapters) # Books of Chronicles (29 Chapters) # Books of Chronicles (36 Chapters) # Book of Ezra (10 Chapters) # Book of Nehemiah (13 Chapters) #Book of Esther (10 Chapters) ===Wisdom books=== #The Book of Job (42 Chapters) #Psalms (150 Chapters) #Book of Proverbs (31 Chapters) #Ecclesiastes (12 Chapters) #Song of Songs (8 Chapters) ===Major prophets=== #Book of Isaiah (66 Chapters) #Book of Jeremiah (52 Chapters) #Book of Lamentations (5 Chapters) #Book of Ezekiel (48 Chapters) #Book of Daniel (12 Chapters) ===Minor prophets=== #Book of Hosea (14 Chapters) #Book of Joel (3 Chapters) #Book of Amos (9 Chapters) #Book of Obadiah (1 Chapter) #Book of Jonah (4 Chapters) #Book of Micah (7 Chapters) #Book of Nahum (3 Chapters) #Book of Habakkuk (3 Chapters) #Book of Zephaniah (3 Chapters) #Book of Haggai (2 Chapters) #Book of Zechariah (14 Chapters) #Book of Malachi (4 Chapters) == Notes == == References == Category:Old Testament
