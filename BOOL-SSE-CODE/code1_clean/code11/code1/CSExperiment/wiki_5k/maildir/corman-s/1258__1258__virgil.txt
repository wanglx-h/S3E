File:Vergilius.jpg portrait of Virgil, 3rd-century AD.]] '''Publius Vergilius Maro''' (; traditional dates 15 October 70 BC21 September 19 BC), usually called '''Virgil''' or '''Vergil''' ( ) in English, was a poet in the Latin language. His poems are about gods and their mythology. Virgil's most famous epic poem is called the ''Aeneis''. == Life == Tradition is that Virgil was born in the village of Andes, near Mantua in Cisalpine Gaul.The epitaph on his tomb in Posilipo near Naples was ''Mantua me genuit; Calabri rapuere; tenet nunc Parthenope. Cecini pascua, rura, duces'' ("Mantua gave birth to me, the Calabrians took me, now Naples holds me; I sang of pastures [the Eclogues], country [the Georgics] and leaders [the Aeneid]"). Scholars looking at the way he used words think that he may have Etruscan mythology, Umbrian or even a Celtic background. Study of his name has led to beliefs that his family may have been earlier Ancient Rome settlers. These modern beliefs are not supported by evidence from his own writings or from writers of his biography. Some scholars have noted that his nickname, ''MARO'', is an anagram of the two main themes in the Aeneid: ''AMOR'' (love) and ''ROMA'' (Rome). == References == Category:70 BC births Category:19 BC deaths Category:Ancient Roman poets Category:1st-century BC writers
