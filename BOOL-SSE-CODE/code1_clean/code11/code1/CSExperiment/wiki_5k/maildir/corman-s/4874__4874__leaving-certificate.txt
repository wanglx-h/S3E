Subject: Leaving Certificate
The '''Leaving Certificate''' is the final exam in the Republic of Ireland secondary school education system. Students have to do the Junior Certificate before they can take the Leaving Certificate. Students also have to take Mathematics and English language. If they took Irish during the Junior Certificate, they also have to take Irish language. Students have to take exams on at least six subjects. They can take either High or Ordinary level tests. In Irish and Maths, there is also a Foundation level. This is for people who have trouble with that subject. The results are given out in the middle of August. A leaving certificate is required in order to go on to college or university.
