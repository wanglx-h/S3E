The show won a Sylvania Award for best children's show and was broadcast nationally on NBC. Rogers studied theology at the nearby Pittsburgh Theological Seminary during his lunch breaks. However, he did not want to go into Preach and was told to continue making children's television after he became a minister. He worked with the University of Pittsburgh's child development and care program. In 1963, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) hired Rogers to create the 15-minute children's program ''Misterogers.'' Rogers moved to Toronto and the series ran for three seasons. Three years later, Rogers moved back to the United States. In 1966, Rogers got the rights to his program from the CBC and moved the show to WQED (TV) in Pittsburgh, where he had worked on ''The Children's Corner''. === ''Mister Rogers' Neighborhood'' === File:Fred Rogers and X the Owl Look Magazine photo 1969.png File:François Clemmons and Fred Rogers Having Foot Bath.jpg ''Mister Rogers' Neighborhood'' began in 1968.

He would then change into Athletic shoe and a Zipper Cardigan (sweater) sweater. The sweaters were all made by his mother. In his show, Rogers would always go on trips, teach new things and show short movies on "Picture, Picture". Each show included a trip to Rogers's "Neighborhood of Make-Believe" with a trolley, a castle, and the people who lived in the neighborhood, including King Friday XIII. Rogers always fed his aquarium fish during the show. He would always tell his audience that he was feeding them. This was because he got a letter from a young blind girl who wanted to know each time he did this. The program would end with Rogers singing "It's Such a Good Feeling". Rogers believed in acting normally, not differently when he was being filmed. He said that "One of the greatest gifts you can give anybody is the gift of your honest self." Rogers wrote almost all of the music on the program. He wanted to teach children to love themselves and others, and he talked about common childhood fears with comforting songs. He once took a trip to a children's hospital to show children that a hospital is not a place to fear. Rogers talked about social issues on his program, such as the Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy of Robert F. Kennedy, racism and divorce. In one famous episode, Rogers put his feet in water with Officer Clemmons (François Clemmons), who was African-American, in a kiddie pool on a hot day.

Rogers ended each program by telling his viewers, ::"You've made this day a special day, by just your being you. There's no person in the whole world like you; and I like you just the way you are" Rogers never talked about his religious beliefs on the show because he did not want any viewer to feel ignored from the show. During the Gulf War, he told his audience that all children in the neighborhood would be well cared for. Rogers asked parents to promise to take care of their children. In 1990, members of the Ku Klux Klan in Missouri played racist versions of Rogers's songs, so Rogers filed a lawsuit against the White supremacy group. A district court judge in Missouri ordered the Ku Klux Klan to stop using Rogers's songs and to give any records they had to Rogers. The judge said the group had committed copyright infringement. After the September 11 attacks, Rogers made Public service announcement for parents about how to discuss tragic world news events with their children. He told viewers to "look for the helpers". Many people still share the quote online after tragic news events. Rogers said in the public service announcement, ::"When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, 'Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.' To this day, especially in times of "disaster," I remember my mother's words and I am always comforted by realizing that there are still so many helpers – so many caring people in this world" === Money for PBS === In 1969, Rogers appeared before the United States Senate United States Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Communications, Technology, and the Internet. His goal was to ask the Senate to support PBS with money and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, because of proposed budget cuts.

He argued that other television programming like his ''Neighborhood'' helped teach children to become happy citizens.

Looks like you just earned the $20million". The Senate increased money for PBS from $9million to $22million. === Role in ''Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.'' === As the issues of households being able to record television programs with a videocassette recorder grew, Rogers was active in supporting VCR companies in court. In 1979, in the case ''Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.'', Rogers said he was not against home recordings of his television programs because families could watch them together at a later time. When the case reached the Supreme Court of the United States in 1983, the majority decision used what Rogers had said. The court found that the Betamax video recorder did not commit Copyright infringement. The court said that his views were an important piece of evidence "that many [television] producers are willing to allow private Recording to continue". ===Other works=== File:Fred Rogers and Daniel S.
