The Dutch started the town in 1634 as part of the colony of New Netherland. During the 19th century Brooklyn expanded and filled Kings County. It remained a separate city before the people there Plebiscite to join New York City in 1898. Today, many parts of Brooklyn are home to people who are mostly from one culture or ethnicity.
