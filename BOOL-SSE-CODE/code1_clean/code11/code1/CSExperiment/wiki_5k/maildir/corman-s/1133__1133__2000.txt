'''2000''' (Roman numerals) was a century leap year leap year starting on Saturday in the Gregorian calendar. It was the last year of the 2nd millennium and the 20th century. 2000 was designated the International Year for the Culture of Peace and the World Mathematical Year. Popular culture holds the year 20007061890293 as the first year of the 21st century and the 3rd millennium, due to a tendency to group the years according to decimal values, as if the nonexistent year zero were counted. According to the Gregorian calendar, these distinctions fall to the year 2001, because the 1st century back then was also retroactively said to start with year AD 1. Since the Gregorian calendar doesn't have year zero, its first millennium spanned from years 1 to 1000 inclusively and its second millennium from years 1001 to 2000. For more information, see century and millennium. The year 2000 is sometimes abbreviated as Y2K. The Y stands for year, and the K stands for kilo which means "thousand." The year 2000 was the subject of Y2K concerns, which were fears that computers wouldn't shift from 1999 to 2000 correctly. However, by the end of 1999, many companies had already converted to new, or upgraded, existing software. Some even obtained Y2K certification. As a result of massive effort, relatively few problems occurred. == Events == === January === *January 1 - To most people, it was the first day of the 21st century and 3rd millennium.
