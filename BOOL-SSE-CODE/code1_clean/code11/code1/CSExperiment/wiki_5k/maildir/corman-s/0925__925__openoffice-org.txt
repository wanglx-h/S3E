The free software project was hosted by Sun Microsystems and then Oracle Corporation and it was based on the older StarOffice software that was created by Sun Microsystems. It was available for many different operating systems, including Microsoft Windows, Linux, OS X, FreeBSD and Solaris; and was meant to be an alternative to Microsoft Office. It supported Microsoft Office file formats as well as its own OpenDocument format. The ".org" part of the previous name OpenOffice.org was there because OpenOffice is already trademarked. It was often called "OOo" for short. In January 2010, Oracle Corporation bought Sun Microsystems, which developed OpenOffice.org until that point. In September 2010, a large part of the developers created The Document Foundation and Fork (software development) the project into the new '''LibreOffice''' project because, among other reasons, they were not certain if the development would be successful under Oracle management. In April 2011, Oracle stopped development of OpenOffice.org and laid off the remaining development team. A few months later, it donated the existing source code and trademarks to the Apache Foundation, which released the first version of '''Apache OpenOffice'''. == Parts == OpenOffice is a collection of applications that work together closely to provide the features expected from a modern office suite. Many of the parts are designed to be alternatives to those available in Microsoft Office. The parts available include: {|class="wikitable" style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto" |File:OOoWriter.svg ||'''OpenOffice.org Writer'''|| A word processor similar in look and feel to Microsoft Word and offering a comparable range of functions and tools. It also includes the ability to export Portable Document Format (PDF) files with no additional software, and can also function as a WYSIWYG editor for creating and editing web pages. |- |File:OOoCalc.svg ||'''OpenOffice.org Calc'''|| A spreadsheet similar to Microsoft Excel with a roughly equivalent range of features. Calc provides a number of features not present in Excel, including a system which automatically defines series for graphing, based on the layout of the user’s data. Calc is also capable of writing spreadsheets directly as a PDF file. |- |File:OOoImpress.svg ||'''OpenOffice.org Impress'''|| A presentation program similar to Microsoft PowerPoint. It can export presentations to Adobe Flash (SWF) files allowing them to be played on any computer with the Flash player installed. It also includes the ability to create PDF files, and the ability to read Microsoft PowerPoint's .ppt format. Impress suffers from a lack of ready-made presentation designs. However, templates are readily available on the Internet.[http://documentation.openoffice.org/Samples_Templates/User/template/presentations/index.html Presentation templates at OpenOffice.org][http://documentation.openoffice.org/Samples_Templates/User/template_2_x/impress/index.html Impress Templates - User/Template] |- |File:OOoBase.svg ||'''OpenOffice.org Base'''|| A database program similar to Microsoft Access. Base allows the creation and manipulation of databases, and the building of forms and reports to provide easy access to data for end-users. As with Access, Base may be used as a front-end to a number of different database systems, including Access databases (JET), Open Database Connectivity data sources and MySQL/PostgreSQL. Base became part of the suite starting with version 2.0. Native to the OpenOffice.org suite is an adaptation of HSQL. While ooBase can be a front-end for any of the databases listed, there is no need for any of them to be installed. |- |File:OOoDraw.svg ||'''OpenOffice.org Draw'''|| A vector graphics editor comparable in features to early versions of CorelDRAW. It features versatile "connectors" between shapes, which are available in a range of line styles and facilitate building drawings such as flowcharts. It has similar features to Desktop publishing software such as Scribus and Microsoft Publisher. |- |File:OOoMath.svg ||'''OpenOffice.org Math'''|| A tool for creating and editing mathematical formulae, similar to Equation Editor. Formulae can be embedded inside other OpenOffice.org documents, such as those created by Writer. It supports multiple typeface and can export to PDF. |} == Other websites == * == References == Category:Office suites Category:OpenOffice.org
