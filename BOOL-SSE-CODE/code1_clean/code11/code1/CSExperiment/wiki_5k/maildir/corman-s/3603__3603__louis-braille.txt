File:Braille.jpg '''Louis Braille''' (4 January 1809 - 6 January 1852) was a French people inventor. He was born in :en:Coupvray. He invented the Braille system, which helps blind people to read. Braille is read by passing one's fingers over characters made up of an arrangement of one to six raised points. It has been adapted to almost every known language. Numbers can be written normal in Braille and there are as well some short forms for common words. Braille was the child of a leather maker. He was the youngest of four children. He had three older siblings, two sisters and a brother. He became blind at the age of three, because he accidentally stuck a stitching awl into one eye while he was in his father's workshop. At the time, there were no antibiotics, and soon his injured eye was infection. The infection spread to his other eye and soon, he became blind in both eyes. He went to the :en:Institut_National_des_Jeunes_Aveugles when he was 10. Braille was a good student, especially in science and music. Later, when he was an adult, he became a church Organ (music). He was also a teacher at the Institute of Blind Youth. Braille died in Paris at the age of 43 of a disease called tuberculosis. == References == Category:1809 births Category:1852 deaths Category:Deaths from tuberculosis Category:Disease-related deaths in Paris Category:French inventors Category:Braille
