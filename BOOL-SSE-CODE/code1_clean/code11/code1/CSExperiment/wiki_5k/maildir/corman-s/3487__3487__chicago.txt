Wind speeds range from 8miles per hour (13km/h) in late summer to 12miles per hour (19km/h) in spring months. The "Windy City" nickname could be connected to Chicago politicians from the 1800s. When Chicago hosted the World's Fair, citizens of Chicago started to brag about it. They bragged so much that the city of Chicago became known as "The Windy City. The phrase may have also been created by Chicago tourism boosters promoting the city. They suggested that the cool breezes from Lake Michigan make Chicago a good summer destination. == Community areas== File:Map of the Community Areas and 'Sides' of the City of Chicago.svg The '''community areas in Chicago''', are defined by the Social Science Research Committee at the University of Chicago.The City of Chicago recognizes 77 divisions in the city.

The government of the City of Chicago is divided into executive and legislative branches. Civil and criminal law cases are heard in the Cook County Circuit Court of the State of Illinois court system, or in the Northern District of Illinois, in the federal system. In the former, the public prosecutor is the Illinois State's Attorney, in the latter, the United States Attorney. ===Mayors of Chicago=== The Mayor of Chicago is the chief executive, elected by general election for a term of four years, with no term limits. The mayor appoints commissioners and other officials who oversee the various departments. In addition to the mayor, Chicago's two other citywide elected officials are the clerk and the treasurer. The City Council is the legislative branch and is made up of 50 aldermen, one elected from each ward in the city. The council enacts local ordinances and approves the city budget. Government priorities and activities are established in a budget ordinance usually adopted each November. The council takes official action through the passage of ordinances and resolutions. The current mayor is Brandon Johnson since 2023. ==Crimes== Chicago had a murder rate of 14.5 per 100,000 residents in 2012.
