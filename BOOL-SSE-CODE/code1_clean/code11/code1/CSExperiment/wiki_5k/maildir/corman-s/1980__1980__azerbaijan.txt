It borders on Russia in the north, Georgia (country) and, Armenia in the west, Iran in the south, and the Caspian Sea on the east. Its capital (city) is Baku. Azerbaijan is also a Persian word that means "guard of fire" (Persian: نگهبان آتش). Azerbaijan also includes the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, an exclave between Armenia on the north and east, Iran on the south and west, and Turkey on the northwest. Azerbaijan's land is both in Asia and Europe. This means it is a Eurasian country. Because Azerbaijan is close to Europe and its history is related to Europe, Azerbaijan is a member of a number of European groups, including the Council of Europe since 2001. Azerbaijan has diplomatic relations with 158 countries. They have membership in 38 international organizations. On May 9, 2006 Azerbaijan was elected to membership in the newly made Human Rights Council by the United Nations General Assembly. More than 90% of the people are ethnic Azerbaijanis. Minorities include Russians, Georgians and other minorities. The Constitution of Azerbaijan does not say there is an official religion. But, Shia Islam, is by far the largest religion in the country, followed by Sunni Islam. There are also a small number of Christians (mainly Eastern Orthodox), Jews (mainly Ashkenazi), agnostics and atheists. == History == Azerbaijan was historically part of Iran and the name of Azerbaijan comes from ''Atropates''. He was a Persian people satrap under the Achaemenid Empire. After the Arab conquest in the 7th century the country has been always under Muslim influence, when its people became Muslim, until the Russian Empire entered the Caucasus region. From 1920 to 1991, Azerbaijan was a Communist country, and as the Azerbaijan SSR, a member of the Soviet Union. Azerbaijan became independent from the Soviet Union when it collapsed in 1991. Since the early 19th century many Russians settled in Azerbaijan, but after the end of the Soviet Union with the independence of Azerbaijan, most Russians and other minorities have left the country and are continuing to leave the country. ==Biodiversity== There are 106 species of mammals, 97 species of fish, 363 species of birds, 10 species of amphibians and 52 species of reptiles which have been recorded and classified in Azerbaijan. The national animal of Azerbaijan is the Karabakh horse. It is a mountain-steppe racing and riding horse native to Azerbaijan. It is one of the oldest breeds, with ancestry dating to the ancient world. However today the horse is an endangered species. Azerbaijan's flora is more than 4,500 species of higher plants. Due the unique climate in Azerbaijan, the flora is much richer in the number of species than the flora of the other countries of the South Caucasus. About 67 percent of the species growing in the whole Caucasus can be in Azerbaijan. ==Education== Many Azerbaijanis have some form of higher education, most notably in scientific and technical subjects. According to Soviet data, 100 percent of males and females (ages nine to forty-nine) were literate (able to read) in 1970. In 2009, the literacy rate in Azerbaijan was 99.5 percent. ==Culture== The culture of Azerbaijan has come about as a result of many influences. Today, Western world influences, including globalization consumer culture, are strong. National traditions are well kept in the country. Some of the main parts of the Azerbaijani culture are: music, literature, folk dances and art, cuisine, architecture, and movies. ===Music and folk dances=== Music of Azerbaijan builds on Folk music that goes back nearly a thousand years.David C. King. ''Azerbaijan'', Marshall Cavendish, 2006, p. 94 Among national musical instruments there are 14 string instruments, eight percussion instruments and six wind instruments. Mugham, meykhana and Ashiq are some of the many musical traditions of Azerbaijan. Mugham is music with poetry and instrumental interludes. When performing Mugham, the singers have to bring their emotions into singing and music. Mugham singer Alim Qasimov is one of the five best singers of all time. Meykhana is a song with no music. It is usually done by several people. They make up the words about a particular subject. Ashiq joins poetry, storytelling, dance and vocal and instrumental music. It is as a symbol of Azerbaijani culture. Azerbaijan was at the Eurovision Song Contest 2008 for the first time in 2008. They hosted the contest in Eurovision Song Contest 2012, in Baku. There are dozens of Azerbaijani folk dances. They are performed at formal festivals. The dancers wear national clothes like the Chokha. Most dances have a very fast rhythm. ===Architecture=== Azerbaijani architecture typically joins Eastern world and Western culture. Many ancient treasures such as the Maiden Tower (Baku) and Palace of the Shirvanshahs in the Baku survive in modern Azerbaijan. Plans have been shown for the building of the Azerbaijan Tower. It will reportedly replace the Burj Khalifa as the tallest building in the world. The planned height is . ===Movies=== The movie industry in Azerbaijan dates back to 1898. In fact, Azerbaijan was among the first countries involved in making movies. In 1991, after Azerbaijan gained its freedom from the Soviet Union, the first Baku International Film Festival East-West was held in Baku. ===Food=== The traditional food is famous for many vegetables and greens used seasonally in the dishes. Fresh herbs, including mint, cilantro (coriander), dill, basil, parsley, tarragon, leeks, chives, thyme, marjoram, green onion, and watercress, are very popular. They are often served with main dishes on the table. National dishes show the variety of the landscape. They are based on fish from the Caspian Sea, local meat (mainly mutton and beef), and the many seasonal vegetables and greens. Saffron-rice plov is the flagship food in Azerbaijan and black tea is the national beverage. ===Literature=== The earliest known person in Azerbaijani literature was Hasanoghlu or Pur Hasan Asfaraini. He made a Diwan (poetry) of Persian language and Turkic language ghazals.A.Caferoglu, "Adhari(azeri)",in ''Encyclopedia of Islam'', (new edition), Vol. 1, (Leiden, 1986) Classical literature in Azerbaijani was formed in 14th century. Among the poets of this period were Gazi Burhanaddin and Jahan Shah. The famed Book of Dede Korkut has two manuscripts copied in the 16th century.Michael E. Meeker, “The Dede Korkut Ethic”, International Journal of Middle East Studies, Vol. 24, No. 3 (Aug., 1992), 395–417. It is a collection of 12 stories showing the oral tradition of Oghuz nomads.İlker Evrım Bınbaş,Encyclopædia Iranica, "Oguz Khan Narratives" [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/oguz-khan-narratives Encyclopædia Iranica | Articles], accessed October, 2010. "The Ketāb-e Dede Qorqut, which is a collection of twelve stories reflecting the oral traditions of the Turkmens in the 15th-century eastern Anatolia, is also called Oḡuz-nāma" In the span of the 17th century and 18th century, Fizuli's unique types as well Ashik poetry were taken up by poets and writers such as Qovsi of Tabriz and Abbas II of Persia. The first newspaper in Azerbaijani, ''Akinchi'' was published in 1875. ===Sports=== Sport in Azerbaijan is very old. Even now, both traditional and modern sports are still practiced. Freestyle wrestling has been traditionally said to be Azerbaijan's national sport. The most popular sports in Azerbaijan are association football and chess. The Azerbaijan national football team does not do well in international competitions. On March 19, 2010, Azerbaijan won the bid to host the 2012 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup. Futsal is another popular sport in Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan national futsal team got fourth place in 2010 UEFA Futsal Championship. Backgammon plays a major role in Azerbaijani culture. This game is very popular in Azerbaijan and is widely played by the local public.[http://www.inforing.net/publications/infopress/sport.php?ELEMENT_ID=3348 Нарды – игра, требующая сноровки и удачи] ==Demographics== {| class="wikitable infobox" style="float:left; margin-left:1em;" |- ! style="background:#f99;" colspan="2"|Ethnic composition (2009) |- |Azerbaijani people||91.60% |- |Lezgian people||2.02% |- |Armenians in Azerbaijan||1.35% |- |Russians||1.34% |- |Talysh people||1.26% |- |Other nations||2.43% |} Out of 9,165,000 people (July 2011), nearly 52% were urban.

The government has largely completed privatization of agriculture and small, medium and large state-ownership company. Azerbaijan is continuing making economic reforms, and old economic ties and structures have been slowly replaced. With independence, Azerbaijan became a member of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Islamic Development Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
