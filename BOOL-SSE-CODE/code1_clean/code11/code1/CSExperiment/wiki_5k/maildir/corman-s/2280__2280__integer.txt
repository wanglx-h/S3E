In mathematics, '''integers''' are whole numbers (natural numbers, their negatives, and zero).Negative numbers have a :wikt:minus (−) in front of the number. Positive numbers have no sign or a :wikt:plus (+) sign in front. Zero usually has no sign. Integers can also be shown on a number line like this: {...-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, +1, +2, +3, +4,...}\,\! In particular, zero or 0 is an integer that is neither positive nor negative. An integer is a whole number with no fractional or decimal part. Integers have no smallest or largest value because for any given integer, there is always a larger and smaller integer. Any integer is either greater than or smaller than any other integer. Consecutive integers are integers that come after each other (as in {1, 2, 3, 4}). The sum, difference and product of integers is always an integer.(for example, (12 + 2345 × (67 - 8)) × 9 is an integer). An integer divided by an integer is sometimes not an integer (for example, 1 ÷ 2 = 0.5). \mathbf{Z} or \mathbb{Z} is the name of the set of integers, and \mathbb{Z}_+\! is the set of positive integers. (\mathbf{Z}, +, 0) is an abelian group. The number of integers is infinite. The cardinal number of \mathbf{Z} is \aleph_0. The ordinal number of \mathbf{Z} is ^*\omega + \omega. To sum up, an integer is a whole number that has no decimals. == In programming == In some programming languages, like C (programming language), there are types called "int" or "integer." == Notes == Category:Number theory Category:Integers
