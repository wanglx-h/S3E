File:Bristol.zoo.crocshoes.arp.jpg '''Leather''' is the skin of an animal made into a durable material by tanning. The skins of cows, pigs, and Domestic goats are often used to make leather. Skins of snakes, alligators or crocodiles, and ostriches are sometimes used to make fancier leather. Shoes, bags, clothes, and balls are often made of leather. Sometimes people make leather out of whales, ducks, giraffes, and African elephants. All of these ways of making leather are very simple but some are rare. == How leather is made == The way leather is made is divided into three processes. They are preparing the leather, tanning it, and crusting. In preparing the leather, many things are done to make it ready for tanning. They include soaking it, removing the hair, liming, deliming, Bathing, bleaching, and pickling. Tanning is a process that makes the Protein, especially collagen, in the raw hide stable. It increases the thermal and chemical stability of the animal Skin. The difference between fresh and tanned animal skin is that fresh animal skin dries to make it hard and stiff. When water is added to it, it becomes bad. But, animal skin that is tanned dries to make it wikt:flexible. It does not become bad when water is added to it. Crusting is a process that makes the leather thin and Lubrication it. Chemicals added when crusting must be set in place. Crusting ends with drying and making the leather soft. It may include splitting, shaving, dyeing, Whitening (leather processing) or other methods. ==From other animals== Today, most leather is made from the skin of cattle, which makes up about 67% of all the leather made. Other animals that are used include Domestic sheep (about 12%), Pig (about 11%), and Domestic goat (about 10%).
