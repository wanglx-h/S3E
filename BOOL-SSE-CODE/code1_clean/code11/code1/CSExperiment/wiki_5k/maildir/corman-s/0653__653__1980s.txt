It is distinct from the decade known as the 199th decade which began on January 1, 1981 and ended on December 31, 1990. This decade (group of ten years) is sometimes called the "Greed decade" in English speaking countries. Unlike the 1960s and 1970s, this is when the word ''yuppie'' was used to describe "young urban professionals" – young adults who lived in city and started to get good jobs. This was also the rise of a more conservatism period in these countries – Ronald Reagan was president for most of this time in the United States, Margaret Thatcher was the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and Brian Mulroney was Prime Minister of Canada. This decade also saw the Soviet Union fight a war that seemed endless in Afghanistan, civil war in Ethiopia. It saw the fall of the Berlin Wall; this started the end of the Cold War and the end of Communism in Eastern Europe. The "eighties" are also well known for their extreme fashions, such as "big hair", New Wave, punk rock, funk, or preppies. Rap music first started to get big in the 80s. It often went with breakdancing in what is now called the "old school" days. Many developments were also made in computer technology during these years; and video games became popular. In sports, Italy national football team and Argentina national football team won the FIFA World Cup. The Philadelphia Phillies, Los Angeles Dodgers, St. Louis Cardinals, Baltimore Orioles, Detroit Tigers, Kansas City Royals, New York Mets, Minnesota Twins and Oakland Athletics won the World Series. The Pittsburgh Steelers, Oakland Raiders, San Francisco 49ers, Washington Redskins, Oakland Raiders, Chicago Bears and New York Giants won the Super Bowl. Finally, the Los Angeles Lakers dominated the NBA, with only the Houston Rockets winning a title. ==Important events== * 1980 - 1988 – Iran-Iraq War * Solidarity (Polish trade union) movement in Poland. * Glasnost and Perestroika reforms in the Soviet Union. * 1981 – AIDS is discovered for the first time. * 1981 – Assassination attempts are made on Ronald Reagan and Pope John Paul II. * 1982 – Falklands War between Argentina and the United Kingdom. * 1979 - 1989 – Soviet-Afghan War * 1984 - Sikh Genocide * 1986 – Prime Minister of Sweden Olof Palme is Assassination of Olof Palme * 1986 – The Space Shuttle Challenger explodes. * 1986 – End of Ferdinand Marcos regime in the Philippines * 1986 – The Chernobyl accident happens in Ukraine because of a test that went wrong.
