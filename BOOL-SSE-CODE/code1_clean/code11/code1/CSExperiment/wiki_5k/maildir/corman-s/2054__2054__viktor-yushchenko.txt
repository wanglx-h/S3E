On November 26, 2004, he lost the Ukrainian presidential election. However, he and his followers argued that the election had been corrupted. They argued that the election results had been falsified by the Ukrainian government, in support of the opposing candidate Viktor Yanukovych. They organized political demonstrations in the autumn and winter of 2004 that gathered millions of people all over the country. They called the demonstrations ''Orange Revolution''. The Constitutional Court ordered a second round of elections, which Yuschenko won. Yushchenko claimed to have been poisoned by political enemies. He was hospitalized and his appearance showed signs of a serious illness.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4035789.stm Profile: Viktor Yushchenko], BBC News Yulia Tymoshenko and Yushchenko were once strong allies (during the Orange Revolution).
