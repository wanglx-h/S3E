Its population is about 1,800,000. The capital of Lesotho is called Maseru. == Geography == Lesotho has no coast on the sea nor on a lake. This type of country is called ''landlocked'', meaning it is surrounded by land. All of Lesotho's trade must either be flown in by aeroplane, or brought in by land. Lesotho's position is unusual: it is completely surrounded by South Africa and has no borders with any other country. This type of country is called an ''enclave''. Lesotho is one of the only three enclaved countries in the world (the other two are San Marino and the Vatican City). This makes Lesotho's relationship with South Africa very important to them both. Lesotho has many mountains and is one of the most mountainous countries in the world. All of Lesotho is at least 1,400 m above sea level. People sometimes travel there to ski in winter. The many mountains in Lesotho mean that it rains there a lot. Lesotho uses some of its water to generate electricity and sells some of the water to South Africa. File:LocationLesotho.png == History == Lesotho became a country in 1818, but it was then called '''Basutoland'''. A man called Moshoeshoe brought several of the groups of people in the area together and formed a new country with him as its king. This new country came under attack from its enemies and in 1868 Moshoeshoe asked Queen Victoria of Great Britain for help. Great Britain said it would help if Lesotho became part of the British Empire. Lesotho eventually gained its independence on 4 October 1966. Now it is a member of the British Commonwealth. King Letsie III is the ruler of Lesotho. ==Cities== {| class="wikitable" |----- ! colspan="6" bgcolor="#FFA500" | Cities in Lesotho |----- ! rowspan="2" bgcolor="#98FB98" | Rang || rowspan="2" bgcolor="#98FB98" | City || colspan="3" bgcolor="#98FB98" | Population || rowspan="2" bgcolor="#98FB98" | District |----- ! bgcolor="#98FB98" | Census 1986 || bgcolor="#98FB98" | Census 1996 || bgcolor="#98FB98" | Estimate 2005 |----- |align=right | 1. || Maseru || align=right | 98,017 || align=right | 137,837 || align=right | 218,355 || Maseru District |----- |align=right | 2. || Teyateyaneng || align=right | 24,336 || align=right | 48,869 || align=right | 75,115 || Berea District |----- |align=right | 3. || Mafeteng || align=right | 12,598 || align=right | 20,804 || align=right | 57,059 || Mafeteng District |----- |align=right | 4. || Hlotse || align=right | 8,021 || align=right | 23,122 || align=right | 47,675 || Leribe |----- |align=right | 5. || Mohale's Hoek || align=right | 7,899 || align=right | 17,871 || align=right | 40,514 || Mohale's Hoek District |----- |align=right | 6. || Maputsoe || align=right | 8,267 || align=right | 27,951 || align=right | 32,117 || Leribe |----- |align=right | 7. || Qacha's Nek || align=right | 4,589 || align=right | 4,797 || align=right | 25,573 || Qacha's Nek District |----- |align=right | 8. || Quthing || align=right | 4,471 || align=right | 9,858 || align=right | 24,130 || Quthing District |----- |align=right | 9. || Peka (Lesotho) || align=right | N.A. || align=right | N.A. || align=right | 17,161 || Leribe |----- |align=right | 10. || Butha-Buthe || align=right | 7,509 || align=right | 12,611 || align=right | 16,330 || Butha-Buthe District |----- |align=right | 11. || Roma, Lesotho || align=right | 5,817 || align=right | N.A. || align=right | 11,612 || Maseru District |----- |align=right | 12. || Mokhotlong || align=right | 2,257 || align=right | 4,275 || align=right | 8,809 || Mokhotlong District |----- |align=right | 13. || Thaba-Tseka || align=right | 2,127 || align=right | 4,449 || align=right | 5,423 || Thaba-Tseka District |} ==Related pages== *Lesotho at the Olympics *Lesotho national football team *List of rivers of Lesotho ==References== Category:Lesotho Category:States and territories established in the 1960s Category:1966 establishments in Africa Category:Current monarchies Category:Least developed countries Category:Commonwealth member states Category:English-speaking countries
