File:Lewis Carroll Self Portrait 1856 circa.jpg '''Lewis Carroll''' was the pen name of '''Charles Lutwidge Dodgson''' (Daresbury, Cheshire, 27 January 1832 – Guildford, Surrey, 14 January 1898).[http://www.online-literature.com/carroll The Literature Network] Dodgson was an Fellow, a logician (mathematics expert), a writer, a poet, an Anglican clergyman, and a photographer. He is most famous for his story ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' which he told to a young friend, Alice Liddell, when he took the girl and two sisters on a boat trip. Alice enjoyed the story and asked Dodgson to write it down. Carroll then wrote a second story about Alice called ''Through the Looking-Glass''. Both stories are still popular all over the world. Dodgson was a Fellow of Christ Church, Oxford, specialising in logic and mathematics. He wrote a number of books and pamphlets on the subject. He died of pneumonia in Guildford, Surrey. ==Works== ===Literary works=== * ''La Guida di Bragia'', a ballad opera for the marionette theatre (around 1850) * ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' (1865) * ''Phantasmagoria (poem)'', and other poems (1869).
