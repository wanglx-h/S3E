Muslim conquests following Muhammad's death led to the creation of the Arab caliphates, occupying a vast geographical area. The Islamic conquests culminated in the Arab Empire being established across three continents (Asia, Africa, and Europe). Today, there are about 1.57 billion Muslims in the world, which is about 1 person in every 4 people. The Muslim population continues to grow. == Related pages == * Islam * Islamic state * Non-denominational Muslims * Arabs * Caliphate * Umayyad Caliphate == References == ==Other websites== *[http://www.islamicsupremecouncil.org/understanding-islam/legal-rulings/53-ritual-prayer-its-meaning-and-manner.html Ritual Prayer: Its Meaning and Manner] – The Islamic Supreme Council of America. *[http://teachmiddleeast.lib.uchicago.edu/historical-perspectives/rulership-and-justice/islamic-period/essay/essay-02.html Muhammad and the First Muslim Ummah] – University of Chicago * [http://www.islamophobiatoday.com/ ''Islamophobia Today'' Newspaper] – An Islamophobia news clearing house * [https://www.academia.edu/24419416/UNDERSTANDING_and_COUNTERING_ISLAMOPHOBIA Sammy Aziz Rahmatti, ''Understanding and Countering Islamophobia''] *Wiktionary:Wikisaurus:Muslim * * Category:Muslims
