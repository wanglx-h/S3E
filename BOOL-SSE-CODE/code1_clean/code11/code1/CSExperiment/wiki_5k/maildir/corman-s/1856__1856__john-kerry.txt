He is a former United States Secretary of State and former Senator from Massachusetts and the United States Democratic Party nominee for president in 2004 United States presidential election. He lost to George W. Bush. He has served in the United States Senate for 23 years and has also served as the lieutenant governor of Massachusetts under Michael Dukakis. In November 2020, then President-elect Joe Biden named Kerry as the U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate. He resigned in early 2024 to help with Biden's Joe Biden 2024 presidential campaign. ==Early life== File:JohnKerry.jpg Kerry was born on December 11, 1943 at Fitzsimons Army Medical Center in Aurora, Colorado. His father was an officer in the United States Army Air Force. He studied at Yale University and at Boston College Law school. Kerry was raised as a Catholic Church by his Catholic father and Episcopalian mother.Caldwell, Deborah, [http://www.beliefnet.com/News/Politics/2004/08/Not-A-Prodigal-Son.aspx "Not a Prodigal Son"], ''beliefnet.com'', August 2004. It was discovered in 2003 by Felix Gundacker, a genealogist working with ''The Boston Globe'', that Kerry's paternal grandparents, who had been born Jewish, as "Fritz Kohn" and "Ida Löwe", in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, changed their names to "Frederick and Ida Kerry" in 1900 and converted from Judaism to Roman Catholicism in 1901 ==Career== In 1968 and 1969, Kerry was a United States Navy officer in Vietnam. During the 2012 Obama reelection campaign, Kerry participated in one on one debate prep with the president, impersonating the Republican candidate Mitt Romney. Kerry's vice presidential candidate was John Edwards. The ticket lost the election to George W. Bush and Dick Cheney. One of the reasons Kerry lost is because people said he was an elitist (he did not understand most Americans) and also because a group called "Swift Boat Veterans for Truth" attacked his service in Vietnam. In November 2006, Kerry once apologizes after saying that college students needed to study hard or else they would "get stuck in Iraq." ==Secretary of State== File:Supreme Court Justice Kagan Swears in Secretary Kerry (1).jpg, Feb 1, 2013]] On December 21, 2012, President Barack Obama nominated Kerry to succeed Hillary Rodham Clinton as United States Secretary of State. The committee said yes on making Kerry the new Secretary of State. Kerry won confirmation by the Senate on January 29, 2012 by a 94-3 vote. He assumed the office of Secretary of State on February 1, 2013. In a letter to Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick, Kerry announced his resignation from the Senate effective February 1. Kerry was sworn in as Secretary of State on February 1, 2013. ==Special Envoy for Climate Change== On November 23, 2020, President-elect Joe Biden announced that Kerry will serve as the U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate in the Biden administration. He was sworn in on January 20, 2021, the same day Biden was Inauguration of Joe Biden as president. On January 13, 2024, at least three sources close to Kerry revealed that he would step down as U.S. climate envoy by the upcoming spring to help with Biden's re-election campaign. He told the Financial Times he planned to stay active in the climate finance space. He officially resigned from his position on March 6, 2024. ==Personal life== He was married to Julia from 1970 until they divorced in 1988. Then he was married to Teresa Heinz since 1995. He has two children and three step-children. He now lives in Boston, Massachusetts. Kerry and his former competitor George W. Bush share an ancestor on Kerry's mother's side and Bush's father's side from the 1600s. Kerry is 6ft 4 in (1.93 m) tall, enjoys surfing and windsurfing, as well as ice hockey, hunting and playing bass guitar. According to an interview he gave to ''Rolling Stone'' magazine in 2004, Kerry's favorite album is ''Abbey Road'' and he is a fan of The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, as well as of Jimi Hendrix and Jimmy Buffett. He never liked heavy metal music. During his 2004 presidential campaign, Kerry used Bruce Springsteen's "No Surrender" as one of his campaign songs. Later he would adopt U2's "Beautiful Day" as his official campaign song. ===Health=== In 2003, Kerry was diagnosed with and successfully treated for prostate cancer. ==References== ==Other websites== * [http://www.johnkerry.com/ JohnKerry.com] —John Kerry's political web site * [https://web.archive.org/web/20041209135553/http://www./ johnkerry. com/about/john_kerry/military_records.html Kerry's military records]—from JohnKerry.com via the Internet Archive * [http://www.johnkerryforsenate.com John Kerry for Senate] -Official 2008 senatorial re-election campaign website * [http://kerry.senate.gov/ John Kerry's Online Office] —Official senatorial site * [http://www.campaignforourcountry.com/ Campaign for Our Country] —PAC led by Kerry * [http://www.boston.com/globe/nation/packages/kerry/images/day1/transcript.htm John Kerry's letter to his parents about Richard Pershing's death]—1968. * s:Vietnam Veterans Against the War Statement—April 1971. * [http://www.cwes01.com/13790/23910/ktpp179-210.pdf John Kerry's Senate hearing testimony] to the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations in 1971 (PDF file) * [http://www.nationalreview.com/document/kerry200404231047.asp John Kerry's complete 1971 statement before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee from National Review] * [http://www.richmond.edu/~ebolt/history398/JohnKerryTestimony.html Selections from John Kerry's 1971 statement before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee] * [http://fas.org/irp/congress/1992_rpt/bcci/ The BCCI Affair, A Report to the Committee on Foreign Relations, United States Senate], by Senator John Kerry and Senator Hank Brown, December 1992 * [https://archive.org/details/GreatSpeechesAndInterviewsWithJohnKerryAndOthers Obama rally with John Kerry and Others MP3] on February 2, 2008 in Sacramento, CA * [http://judaism.about.com/od/jewishgenealogy/a/jewpas_kerry.htm Irish Catholic or Czech Jew?] —Kerry's long lost Jewish ethnic ancestry * Schanberg, Sydney H., [http://www.villagevoice.com/2004-02-17/news/when-john-kerry-s-courage-went-m-i-a/ When John Kerry's Courage Went M.I.A., ''The Village Voice, '' February 17, 2004] * Kranish, Michael, [http://www.boston.com/globe/nation/packages/kerry/ John Kerry: Candidate in the making], ''The Boston Globe'', June 15, 2003 * [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3003306.stm Profile: John Kerry], Paul Reynolds, BBC News, November 5, 2004 * [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/choice2004/ Frontline: the choice 2004]—Thorough two-hour special comparing Kerry and Bush * [http://www.nysun.com/article/3775 Researcher Alleges Potential Plagiarism in 11 Passages of Kerry's Writings] Category:1943 births Category:Living people Category:American military personnel of the Vietnam War Category:American Roman Catholics Category:People from Aurora, Colorado Category:2004 United States presidential candidates Category:John Kerry Category:Politicians from Boston Category:Politicians from Colorado Category:Purple Heart recipients Category:United States Secretaries of State Category:United States senators from Massachusetts Category:Democratic Party (United States) politicians Category:Yale University alumni Category:21st-century American politicians Category:20th-century American politicians Category:Lawyers from Boston Category:Lawyers from Colorado Category:Military people from Colorado
