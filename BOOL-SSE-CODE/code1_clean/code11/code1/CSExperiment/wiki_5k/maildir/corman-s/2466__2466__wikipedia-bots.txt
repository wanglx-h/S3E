'''Bots''' are automated scripting language or processes which perform jobs on Wikipedia. Usually, they do jobs which would take a long time to do without the bot. Bots perform their jobs under a different user name than the owner, so that it is easy to tell them apart. Also, bot edits are hidden from pages like Special:Recentchanges to keep them from flooding the list. To see the bot edits, [ manually add hidebots=0] to your :w:query string, or click "show bot edits" at the top of Special:Recentchanges. The most popular type of bot is called the [http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywikipediabot/ Python Wikipedia Robot Framework] or "pywikibot" for short. See also [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Creating_a_bot#Programming_languages_and_libraries this list of other frameworks] for creating bots. == Current bots == These users have been given a "bot flag" and are approved to perform tasks. See Special:Listusers/bot for a current list of fully approved bots. All bots should be approved (with or without a bot flag) before editing. During their approval process (see below), bots may make up to 50 edits to show how they will be working. Any bot not approved (with or without a flag) or found to be making edits it was not approved for may be blocked. {| class="wikitable sortable" ! Bot Name !! Owner !!

These bots do not usually edit often enough for them to need the bot flag. Also, there may be other reasons for their edits to not be marked as a bot edit. The following bots are approved to edit without a bot flag: {| class="wikitable sortable" ! Bot Name !! Owner !!

Describe your bot on the Wikipedia talk:Bots, create a new account for it, run some tests for a short time, and get agreement from other users that the bot's use is a good idea. Once that is done, your bot may be given a bot flag by a bureaucrat. === Global bots === * This wiki uses the m:bot policy, and allows m:bot policy#Global_bots and m:bot policy#Automatic_approval. Other bots should apply on Wikipedia talk:Bots. == Bot help requests == If you have a task which you think a bot can help with, contact one of the bot owners, or make a request on the Wikipedia talk:Bots. == Related pages == # :en:Wikipedia:Bot requests # meta:Interwiki bot # meta:Interwiki bot/Getting started # meta:Category:Pywikipedia # sourceforge:projects/pywikipediabot # sourceforge:projects/dotnetwikibot # :Category:Wikipedia bots
