Only Omaha has more people of any city in Nebraska. Lincoln is also the county seat of Lancaster County, Nebraska and the home of the University of Nebraska–Lincoln. Lincoln's 2020 Census population was 291,082. Lincoln was founded in 1856 as the village of Lancaster. It became the county seat of the newly created Lancaster County, Nebraska in 1859. The capital of Nebraska Territory had been Omaha, Nebraska since the start of the territory in 1854. Most of the territory's population lived south of the Platte River. After much of the territory south of the Platte became a part of Kansas, the legislature voted to move the capital south of the river and as far west as possible. They made the village of Lancaster the new capital, in part due to the salt flats and marshes. File:USA ne lincoln capitol.jpg]] People from Omaha tried to stop the move by renaming Lancaster after the recently killed President Abraham Lincoln. Many of the people south of the river had wanted the Confederate States of America to win the recent Civil War. These people thought that the legislature would not approve the move if the future capital were named after Lincoln. The plan did not work, as Lancaster was renamed Lincoln and also became the state capital upon Nebraska's admission to the Union on March 1, 1867. The people either liked or disliked the new name depending on how they felt about the Civil War. File:Nebraska State Capitol (at night, 2016), Lincoln, Nebraska, USA.jpg Nebraska State Capitol was designed by Bertram Goodhue and constructed between 1922 and 1932. The capitol building is a skyscraper topped by a golden dome. The tower is crowned by a 6-meter (20ft) statue of a farmer sowing grain on a pedestal of wheat and corn, to represent the state's agricultural heritage. City zoning rules prevent any other building from rivaling it in height, making it a landmark not only within the city but for the surrounding area. Inside, there are many paintings and iridescent murals showing Native American heritage and the history and culture of the early pioneers who settled Nebraska. It is the second tallest U.S. State Capitol building behind the Louisiana State Capitol building in Baton Rouge. In March of 2023, Red Way was announced to start operating from Lincoln Airport, but, in August of 2023, because the airline was running out of money, the airline decided to shut down. Lincoln has a humid continental climate (''Dfa'' in the Köppen climate classification). ==References== Category:County seats in Nebraska Category:Lincoln, Nebraska Category:State capitals in the United States Category:1856 establishments in Nebraska Territory
