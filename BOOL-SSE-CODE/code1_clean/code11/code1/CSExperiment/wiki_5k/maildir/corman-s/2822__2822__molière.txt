His real name was '''Jean-Baptiste Poquelin''', Molière was his stage name. He wrote some of the most important comedy in human history. He was born in Paris where his father owned a carpet shop. As a young person, Molière decided to live an artist's life. At the age of 21, he founded a theatre company that soon went bankrupt. From 1645 to 1658, he toured France with some of his friends. Later, King Louis XIV made Molière responsible for the entertainment at the court of Versailles near Paris. Molière was happy to have the king among his friends, because he had many enemies, especially important people in the Roman Catholic church. Molière's comedies deal with human weaknesses: jealousy, meanness, hypocrisy, fear of death. By putting his characters in ridiculous situations, Molière wants to entertain and educate his audience. One of his most important Play (theatre) is ''Tartuffe'', showing a bigotry man stealing his way into a rich family. Molière's last play was ''Le Malade Imaginaire'', called in English ''The Hypochondriac''. As in many of his comedies, Molière played the main role. He died due to pulmonary tuberculosis on stage during the fourth performance. Because of his problems with the church, he was not allowed to be buried in a church cemetery. == References == == Other websites == * * [http://www.toutmoliere.net Molière's works online] at toutmoliere.net (in French) * [http://www.site-moliere.com/pieces/ Molière's works online] at site-moliere.com * [http://www.inlibroveritas.net/auteur30.html Molière's works online] at InLibroVeritas.net * [http://www.classicistranieri.com/dblog/articolo.asp?articolo=4546 Molière's works online] at classicistranieri.com * [http://www.biblioweb.org/-MOLIERE-.html Biography, Bibliography, Analysis, Plot overview] at biblioweb.org (in French) * [http://www.theatre-classique.fr Molière's Verses Plays] Publication, Statistics, Words Research (in French) * [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbGqsquB0Bw Professional quality parody - "The Life & Times of Molière"] at YouTube.com Category:1622 births Category:1673 deaths Category:Actors from Paris Category:French playwrights Category:Writers from Paris Category:Pen names Category:Burials at Père Lachaise Cemetery
