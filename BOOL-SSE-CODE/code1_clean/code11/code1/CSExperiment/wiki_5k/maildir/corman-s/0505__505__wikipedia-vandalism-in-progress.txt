__NOTOC__ :''Please add new reports at the bottom.'' == Current alerts == ===Bot-reported=== === User-reported === *: This account was created today and today it has created a ruckus on Wikipedia. I have warned this account user many times but he is not stopping. You can see his edits: **On Karauli Princely State, He reverted my [https://simple.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Karauli_Princely_State&diff=prev&oldid=10433251 edits] even though I had clearly mentioned in the edit summary each time what I had done, yet he is still fighting with me through edit war. I've even given him warnings, but he isn't stopping. ** On Khatana article, Vkragnarr is removing the [https://simple.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Khatana&diff=prev&oldid=10433515 infobox] from the Khatana article without any reason. ** On Rawal Gujjars article, VikRagnarr removing the [https://simple.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rawal_Gujjars&diff=prev&oldid=10433741 reliable source] without any reason. ** On Patanvadia Koli article, VikRagnarr removing [https://simple.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Patanvadia_Koli&diff=prev&oldid=10433502 Indianexpress] which is reliable source but he removing it without any reason. This source is registered as a reliable source you can see :en:WP:INDIANEXP here. Vikrgnarr has done the same thing on [https://simple.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Koli_Patel&diff=prev&oldid=10433495 Koli Patel] You can see it. In the same spirit, Vikragnarr removed the source [https://simple.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Koli_caste&diff=prev&oldid=10433254 here] too without any reason. One thing to notice is that VikRagnarr is editing exactly like HistorianAlfredo and is editing the same articles on which HistorianAlfredo had edited once. Just today, Fr33kman blocked the account of HistorianAlfredo for 3 months and right after that a new account in the name of VikRagnarr was created. Isn't it amazing? —User:Harbhajan Piyale (User talk:Harbhajan Piyale • Special:Contributions/Harbhajan Piyale) 15:50, 2 August 2025 (UTC) * actions evidently indicate a vandalism-only account.
