Also, Boundary Peak is less than away from its higher neighbor. Hence Boundary Peak can be described as not being wholly within Nevada. By contrast, the prominence of Wheeler Peak, , is quite large and in fact it is the twelfth largest in the contiguous United States. Wheeler Peak is the highest point in a radius of more than and is entirely within the state of Nevada.}} | elevation_max_ft = 13,147 | elevation_max_m = 4007.1 | elevation_ft = 5,500 | elevation_m = 1680 | elevation_min_point = Colorado River at | elevation_min_ft = 481 | elevation_min_m = 147 | iso_code = US-NV | website = http://www.nv.gov/ | Capital = | Representatives = }} '''Nevada''' is one of the United States' U.S. state. Its capital (city) is Carson City, Nevada. The largest city is Las Vegas, Nevada. Other big cities are Henderson, Nevada and Reno, Nevada. More than two-thirds of the people live in the Las Vegas urban area.https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/urban-rural.html Most of Nevada is in the Great Basin. It is the driest state in the United States. Nevada was first inhabited by Native Americans. It was colonized by Spain and was part of New Spain. Later, it was part of New Mexico. It was taken by the United States in the Mexican–American War. The most common ancestries in Nevada include Mexican, German, Irish, English, Italian and Asian.[https://www.info-america-usa.com/nevada/ Nevada] Many White people and Hispanics live in the state. ==History== Nevada was originally wikt:founder in 1821 as part of the First Mexico Empire. The Mexican Empire turned into the Mexican Republic in 1823, along with Nevada. Before the arrival of Europeans, Nevada was inhabited by Native American tribes including the Shoshone, the Paiute, the Washoe, and the Mohave. ===The Mexican-American Conflict=== Fighting between the United States and Mexico started. They fought over what was to become the Southwestern United States and who could own this land. This was called the Mexican-American War. The war ended in an American wikt:victory in 1848. Nevada later became an American territory in 1861. It was called the "Nevada Territory". This was not all of Nevada as it is today. The eastern part of Nevada was part of "Utah Territory" and the southern part was part of "New Mexico". In 1859 in the Comstock Lode, gold and silver were first discovered. This started a huge growth in mining in the state which Nevada is known for. ===Gaining statehood=== On October 31, 1864, now celebrated as "Nevada Day", Nevada was made the 36th state in the United States. It was given the distinct shape resembling a rectangle with a triangle. It was named ''Nevada'' meaning "snowy land" in Spanish language, because it was snowy in the North. Later, on May 5, 1866, Nevada got its current borders because the Paiutes County in Arizona was taken as part of Nevada. It is now Clark County, Nevada. It was also agreed upon that the western part of Utah would become Eastern Nevada. ==Economy== Tourism is very important to the economy of Nevada. Many people visit Las Vegas, which has many Casino and resorts. There is not as much farming as there is in some other states, because Nevada is so dry. However, mining is big in Nevada. More gold is mined in Nevada than in any other state.
