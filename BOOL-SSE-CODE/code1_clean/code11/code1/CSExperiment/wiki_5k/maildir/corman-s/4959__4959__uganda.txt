Its capital (city) and biggest city is Kampala. The currency is the Ugandan Shilling. The official languages of Uganda are English language and Kiswahili. The most common religion is Christianity. The President of Uganda is Yoweri Kaguta Museveni. The country is to the East of Africa. The population of Uganda is 50 million people as of 2024. The area of Uganda is about 236,040 km2. Uganda produces coffee and copper. The literacy rate of Uganda is 68%, which mean people in Uganda who are at least 15 years old know how to read and write. Uganda is among countries thought to be very corrupt by Transparency International. It is rated at 2.4 on a scale from 0 (the most corrupt) to 10 (the most clean). Uganda is one of the poorest nations in the world. 37.7 percent of the people live on less than $1.25 a day. == History == Uganda, located in East Africa, has a rich history. It was home to ancient kingdoms like Buganda, Bunyoro, and Ankole. Colonial rule began with the arrival of the British in the late 19th century. Independence was achieved in 1962 under the leadership of Milton Obote. The country faced political instability, with Idi Amin's regime notorious for human rights abuses in the 1970s. Yoweri Museveni took power in 1986, bringing relative stability. Uganda has since experienced economic growth, though challenges like conflicts in the north have persisted. ==Geography== File:Papyrus, Uganda (15770849392).jpg Uganda is almost completely in the Nile basin. At the centre of the country is Lake Kyoga. Although landlocked, Uganda has many large lakes. Besides Lake Victoria and Lake Kyoga, there are Lake Albert (Africa), Lake Edward and the smaller Lake George (Uganda). Most important cities are in the south, near Lake Victoria, including the capital Kampala and the nearby city of Entebbe. The climate is mostly equatorial. But it is not the same everywhere because there are some changes in altitude. The difference in altitude changes the climate. Southern Uganda is wetter with rain generally throughout the year. At Entebbe on the northern shore of Lake Victoria, most rain falls from March to June and in the November/December period. Further to the north a dry season slowly emerges. At Gulu about 120km from the South Sudanese border, November to February is much drier than the rest of the year. ==Cities== The largest cities in Uganda are: {| style="font-size:100%;" |- | width="100%" align="center" | '''25 Largest Cities in Uganda''' '''(2011 Estimates)''' |- valign="top" | {| class="wikitable sortable" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" ! style="width:2em;" |Rank!!Name!!2011 Population Estimate |- |1||'''Kampala'''||1,659,600 |- |2||'''Kira Town'''||179,800 |- |3||'''Gulu'''||154,300 |- |4||'''Lira, Uganda'''||108,600 |- |5||'''Mbale'''||91,800 |- |6||'''Nansana'''||89,900 |- |7||'''Jinja, Uganda'''||89,700 |- |8||'''Mbarara'''||83,700 |- |9||'''Entebbe'''||79,700 |- |10||'''Kasese'''||74,300 |- |11||'''Masaka'''||74,100 |- |12||'''Soroti'''||66,000 |- |13||'''Njeru'''||64,900 |- |14||'''Kitgum'''||59,700 |- |15||'''Arua'''||59,400 |- |16||'''Mukono||59,000 |- |17||'''Iganga'''||53,700 |- |18||'''Koboko'''||51,300 |- |19||'''Busia, Uganda'''||47,100 |- |20||'''Fort Portal'''||47,100 |- |21||'''Kabale'''||44,600 |- |22||'''Masindi'''||45,400 |- |23||'''Tororo'''||43,700 |- |24||'''Hoima'''||42,600 |- |25||'''Mityana'''||39,300 |- |} |} ==Culture and sport== Because there are so many communities, culture in Uganda is diverse. Many Asians (mostly from India) who had to leave during the regime of Amin have returned to Uganda. Association football is the national sport in Uganda. Games with the Uganda national football team usually attract large crowds of Ugandans. The Ugandan Super League is the top division of Ugandan football. There are 16 clubs from across the country.

Uganda won gold medals at the Olympics in athletics with legendary hurdler John Akii-Bua in 1972 and marathon winner at the London 2012 Olympics Stephen Kiprotich.
