File:Main-vom-maintower-ffm001.jpg The '''Main''' (pronounced in German like the English word ''mine'') is a river in Germany, 524km in length, and one of the bigger tributaries of the Rhine river. Its average discharge at Frankfurt East Harbour is 190 cubic metres/second. It flows through the States of Germany (states) of Bavaria, Hesse and 25 Kilometers along the border of Bavaria with Baden-Württemberg. The biggest city on the Main is Frankfurt am Main, others are Bayreuth, Bamberg, Würzburg, Hanau and Offenbach am Main. The mid Main valley is characterised by many winerys. It is part of the region of Franken. Boats on the Main can use the Rhine-Main-Danube Canal to go to Eastern Europe. File:Fluss Main in Deutschland.PNG The name of the river has nothing to do with the English word ''main'', which means ''most important'', or the French word ''main'', which means ''hand''. The river was named ''Mogin'' by the ancient celts after their god Mogon. Later, the Roman Empire called the river ''Moenus'' in Latin language. In the Middle Ages, this name became ''Meyn'' and later ''Main''. Category:Rivers of Baden-Württemberg Category:Rivers of Bavaria Category:Rivers of Hesse
