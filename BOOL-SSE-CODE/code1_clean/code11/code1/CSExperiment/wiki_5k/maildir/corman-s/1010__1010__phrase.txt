A '''phrase''' is a group of words that adds meaning to a sentence. A phrase is not a sentence because it is not a complete idea with a wikt:subject, verb and a wikt:predicate. English language has five different kinds of phrases, one for each of the main Part of speech. In a phrase, the main word or the word that is that is the subject of the phrase is called the '''head'''. In the following examples, it is printed in '''bold'''. The other words in the phrase do the work of changing, or modifyingm the head. In a '''noun phrase''', one or more words work together to give more information about a noun. * all my dear '''children''' * the information '''age''' * seventeen hungry '''lions''' in the rocks In an '''adjective phrase''', one or more words work together to give more information about an adjective. * so very '''sweet''' * '''earnest''' in her desire * very '''happy''' with his work In a '''verb phrase''', one or more words work together to give more meaning to a verb. In English, the verb phrase is very complex, but a good description of its many forms can be found [http://papyr.com/hypertextbooks/engl_126/ph_verb.htm here]. In an '''adverb phrase''', one or more words work together to give more information about an adverb. * especially '''softly''' * '''formerly''' of the city of Perth * much too '''quickly''' to see clearly In a '''prepositional phrase''', one or more words work together to give information about time, location, or possession, or condition.
