His inauguration speech lasted an hour and forty minutes. William Henry Harrison caught a serious case of pneumonia, and on April 4 that same year he died. He was the first president to die in office. Harrison was the oldest president to take office at , until it was outdone in 1981 by Ronald Reagan who assumed the presidency at the age of 69. He was the last president to be born before the United States Declaration of Independence. His grandson was the 23rd president of the United States, Benjamin Harrison. ==Early life== Harrison was born on February 9, 1773. He is the youngest of Benjamin Harrison V and Elizabeth Bassett's seven children. They lived in Berkeley Plantation at Charles City County, Virginia. He was the last president to be born as a British citizen before the American Independence. His father was a planter and a delegate to the Continental Congress (1774–1777) who signed the United States Declaration of Independence. He was Governor of Virginia between 1781 and 1784. His older brother Carter Bassett Harrison was elected a representative of Virginia in the United States House of Representatives. In 1787, he attended the Presbyterian Hampden-Sydney College. He attended the school until 1790. Harrison was fluent in Latin and French language. ==Marriage and family== In 1795, he met Anna Harrison. They had 10 children. ==As President== He took the oath of office on March 4, 1841 which was a cold and wet day. His inauguration was the longest in American history at 8,460 words and lasting almost two hours. Harrison's inaugural address was a detailed statement of the Whig agenda, mainly unclaimed honest of Andrew Jackson's and Martin Van Buren's policies. Harrison promised to reestablish the Bank of the United States and extend its maximum amount for credit by issuing paper currency (see Henry Clay). Harrison is also regarded as the President of the United States with the shortest term in office, serving 30 days, 12 hours, and 30 minutes. ==Illness and death== On March 26, 1841, Harrison became ill with a common cold. His illness was believed to have been caused by the bad weather in the inauguration. The cold was worsened, quickly turning to pneumonia and pleurisy. He tried to rest in the White House, but could not find a quiet room because of the crowd of office seekers. His very busy social schedule made it harder for time to rest. Harrison's doctors tried cures of applying opium, castor oil, leeches, and Virginia snakeweed. But the treatments only made Harrison worse, and he became restless. Harrison died on his 32nd day as president on April 4, 1841 at 12:30 am of pneumonia, jaundice, and septicima. He was 68 years old and the first president of the United States to die in office. Harrison's funeral took place in Wesley Chapel in Cincinnati, Ohio on April 7, 1841, three days after his death. His original interment was in Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C.. He was later buried in North Bend, Ohio. ==References== == Other websites == * [https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/presidents/william-henry-harrison/ William Henry Harrison's White House biography] Category:1773 births Category:1841 deaths Category:Deaths from pneumonia Category:Deaths from jaundice Category:United States senators from Ohio Category:United States representatives from Ohio Category:Politicians from Virginia Category:William Henry Harrison Category:Benjamin Harrison Category:Whig Party (United States) politicians Category:19th-century American politicians Category:18th-century American politicians Category:19th-century presidents of the United States
