'''August''' (Aug.) is the eighth month of the year in the Gregorian calendar, coming between July and September. It has 31 days. It is named after the Roman emperor Augustus Caesar. August does not begin on the same day of the week as any other month in common years, but begins on the same day of the week as February in leap years. August always ends on the same day of the week as November. == The Month == File:Hw-augustus.jpg, after whom August is named]] This month was first called ''Sextilis'' in Latin, because it was the sixth month in the old Roman calendar. The Roman calendar began in March about 735BC with Romulus and Remus. October was the eighth month. August was the eighth month when January or February were added to the start of the year by King Numa Pompilius about 700BC. Or, when those two months were moved from the end to the beginning of the year by the decemvirs about 450BC (Roman writers disagree). In 153 BC January 1 was determined as the beginning of the year. August is named for Augustus Caesar who became Roman consul in this month. The month has 31 days because Julius Caesar added two days when he created the Julian calendar in 45 BC. August is after July and before September. August, in either hemisphere, is the seasonal equivalent of February in the other. In the Northern hemisphere it is a summer month and it is a winter month in the Southern hemisphere. No other month in common years begins on the same day of the week as August, but August begins on the same day of the week as February in leap years. August ends on the same day of the week as November every year, as each other's last days are 13 weeks (91 days) apart. In common years, August starts on the same day of the week as March and November of the previous year, and in leap years, June of the previous year. In common years, August finishes on the same day of the week as March and June of the previous year, and in leap years, September of the previous year. In common years immediately after other common years, August starts on the same day of the week as February of the previous year. In years immediately before common years, August starts on the same day of the week as May of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, October of the following year. In years immediately before common years, August finishes on the same day of the week as May of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, February and October of the following year. == August observances == === Fixed observances and events === File:Schweizerflaggen St. Gallen.JPGs celebrating Switzerland's national day on August 1.]] * August 1 National Day of Switzerland * August 1 Independence Day (Benin) * August 1 Emancipation Day (Bermuda, Guyana, Jamaica, Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago) * August 1 Army Day (People's Republic of China) * August 1 Lammas Day, cross-quarter day in the Celts calendar * August 1 Statehood Day (Colorado) * August 2 Republic Day (Republic of Macedonia) * August 2 Emancipation Day (Bahamas) * August 3 Independence Day (Niger) * August 5 Independence Day (Burkina Faso) * August 5 Victory Day (Croatia) * August 6 Independence Day (Bolivia) * August 6 Independence Day (Jamaica) * August 7 Independence Day (Ivory Coast) * August 8 Father's Day (Taiwan) * August 9 National Day of Singapore * August 9 Day of the Indigenous People (Suriname) * August 9 National Women's Day (South Africa) * August 10 Independence Day (Ecuador) * August 10 Missouri Day * August 11 Independence Day (Chad) * August 12 Perseid Meteor Shower * August 12 Queen Sirikit's Birthday (Thailand) * August 13 Independence Day (Central African Republic) * August 14 Independence Day (Pakistan) * August 15 Assumption of Mary in Western Christianity * August 15 Independence Day (India) * August 15 Independence Day (Republic of the Congo) * August 15 Independence Day (Bahrain) * August 15 National Day of South Korea * August 15 National Day of Liechtenstein * August 15 Victory in Japan Day * August 17 Independence Day (Indonesia) * August 17 Independence Day (Gabon) * August 19 World Humanitarian Day * August 19 Independence Day (Afghanistan) * August 20 Feast day of Stephen I of Hungary * August 20 Regaining of Independence (Estonia) * August 21 Admission Day (Hawaii) * August 21 Ninoy Aquino Day (Philippines) * August 21 Saint Helena Day * August 22 Start of Ashenda (Ethiopia and Eritrea) * August 23 National Heroes Day (Philippines) * August 24 Independence Day (Ukraine) * August 25 Independence Day (Uruguay) * August 26 Heroes' Day (Namibia) * August 27 Independence Day (Moldova) * August 28 Assumption of Mary (Eastern Christianity) * August 29 National Uprising Day (Slovakia) * August 30 Constitution Day (Kazakhstan) * August 30 Republic Day (Tatarstan) * August 30 Victory Day (Turkey) * August 31 Independence Day (Kyrgyzstan) * August 31 Independence Day (Malaysia) * August 31 Independence Day (Trinidad and Tobago) === Moveable and Monthlong events === File:PipesAndDrums.jpg.]] * Edinburgh Festival, including the Military Tattoo at Edinburgh Castle, takes place through most of August and beginning of September. * UK Bank Holidays: First Monday in Scotland, last Monday in England and Wales * National Eisteddfod, cultural celebration in Wales: First week in August * Children's Day in Uruguay: Second Sunday in August * Monday after August 17: Holiday in Argentina, commemorating José de San Martín * Discovery Day in Canada: third Monday in August * Summer Olympics, often held in July and/or August == Selection of Historical Events == File:Bundesbrief2.jpg]] File:Indonesia declaration of independence 17 August 1945.jpg declaring Indonesia independent.]] File:Krakatoa eruption lithograph.jpg exploded on August 27, 1883.]] File:Martin Luther King -
