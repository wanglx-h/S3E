Image:Vector normalization.svg A '''vector''' is a mathematical wikt:object that has a size, called the ''magnitude'', and a direction. It is often represented by boldface letters (such as \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w}), or as a line segment from one point to another (as in \overrightarrow{AB}). For example, a vector would be used to show the distance and direction something moved in. When asking for directions, if one says "Walk one kilometer towards the North", that would be a vector, but if they say "Walk one kilometer", without showing a direction, then that would be a scalar. We usually draw vectors as arrows. The length of the arrow is Proportionality to the vector's magnitude. The direction in which the arrow points to is the vector's direction. ==Examples of vectors== * John walks north 20 meters. The direction "north" together with the distance "20 meters" is a vector. * An apple Falling down at 10 meters per second. The direction "down" combined with the speed "10 meters per second" is a vector. This kind of vector is also called velocity. ==Examples of scalars== * The distance between two places is 10 kilometers. This distance is not a vector because it does not contain a direction. * The number of fruit in a box is not a vector. * A person pointing is not a vector because there is only a direction. There is no magnitude (the distance from the person's finger to a building, for example). * The length of an object. * A car drives at 100 kilometers per hour. This does not describe a vector, as there is only a magnitude, but no direction. ==More examples of vectors== * Displacement vector is a vector. Displacement is the distance that something moves ''in a certain direction''. A measure of distance alone is a scalar. * Force (physics) that includes direction is a vector. * Velocity is a vector, because it is a speed in a certain direction.

An object is accelerating if it is changing speed or changing direction. ==How to add vectors== ===Adding vectors on paper using the head to tail method=== File:Head-to-tail Addition.png The Head to Tail method of adding vectors is useful for doing an estimate on paper of the result of adding two vectors. To do it: * Each vector is drawn as an arrow with an amount of length behind it, where each unit of length on the paper represents a certain magnitude of the vector. * Draw the next vector, with the tail(end) of the second vector at the head(front) of the first vector. * Repeat for all further vectors: Draw the tail of the next vector at head of the previous one. * Draw a line from the tail of the first vector to the head of the last vector - that's the resultant(sum) of all the vectors. It's called the "Head to Tail" method, because each head from the previous vector leads in to the tail of the next one. ===Using component form=== Using the component form to add two vectors literally means adding the components of the vectors to create a new vector. For example, let '''a''' and '''b''' be two two-Dimension vectors. These vectors can be written in terms of their components. \mathbf{a} = ( a_x, a_y ) \mathbf{b} = ( b_x, b_y ) Suppose '''c''' is the sum of these two vectors, so that '''c''' = '''a''' + '''b'''. This means that \mathbf{c} = ( a_x + b_x, a_y + b_y ). Here is an example of addition of two vectors, using their component forms: \mathbf{a} = ( 3, -1 ) \mathbf{b} = ( 2, 2 ) \begin{align}\mathbf{c} & = \mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} \\ & = ( a_x + b_x, a_y + b_y ) \\ & = ( 3 + 2, -1 + 2 ) \\ & = ( 5, 1 ) \end{align} This method works for all vectors, not just 2D ones. ==How to multiply vectors== ===Using the dot product=== The dot product is one method to multiply vectors. It produces a scalar. It uses component form: \begin{align}\mathbf{a} & = (2, 3)\\ \mathbf{b} & = (1, 4) \\ \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} & = (2,3)\cdot(1,4) \\ & = (2\cdot 1)+(3\cdot 4) \\ & = 2+12 \\ &= 14 \end{align} ===Using the cross product=== The cross product is another method to multiply vectors. Unlike dot product, it produces a vector. Using component form: \mathbf{a}\times\mathbf{b}=|\mathbf{a}||\mathbf{b}|\sin(\theta) \mathbf{n} Here, |\mathbf{a}| means the length of \mathbf{a}, and \mathbf{n} is the unit vector at right angles to both \mathbf{a} and \mathbf{b}. ===Multiplying by a scalar=== To multiply a vector by a scalar (a normal number), you multiply the number by each component of the vector: c\,\mathbf{x} = (c\,x_1,c\,x_2,...,c\,x_n) An example of this is \begin{align}c & = 5\\ \mathbf{x} & = (3,4)\\ c\,\mathbf{x} & = (5\cdot3, 5\cdot4)\\ & = (15, 20) \end{align} ==Related pages== * Analytic geometry * Eigenvalues and eigenvectors * Null vector * Unit vector * Vector field * Vector graphics * Vector space * Vector subspace ==References== Category:Vectors Category:Basic physics ideas
