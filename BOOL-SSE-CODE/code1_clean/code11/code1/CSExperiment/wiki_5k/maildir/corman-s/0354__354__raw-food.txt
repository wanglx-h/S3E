*''For the World Wrestling Entertainment brand/TV Show, see WWE Raw.'' Foods are '''raw''' when they are not cooked. Most things are safe to eat raw, but some of them can be poisonous. ==Health== There's currently no solid evidence to suggest that raw food is more healthy than cooked food. ===Germs=== Raw food can sometimes make people sick because of bacteria which would otherwise be killed by cooking.
