The first members of the band were Freddie Mercury (lead vocals, piano), Brian May (lead guitar, vocals), Roger Taylor (Queen drummer) (drums, vocals), and John Deacon (bass guitar). Their current guest lead singer is Adam Lambert. Freddie Mercury died of AIDS-related bronchopneumonia on November 24, 1991 at the age of 45.http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/24/newsid_2546000/2546945.stm BBC In 1997, John Deacon retired from music to spend more time with his family. The other two members toured with Paul Rodgers from 2005 to 2006. In December 2018 it was announced that Queen & Lambert would bring its Rhapsody Tour to The Formation and evolution of the Solar System in 2019. Three of Queen's biggest hits were"Bohemian Rhapsody”, "We Will Rock You", and "We Are the Champions". ==Formation== With his friend Tim Staffell, Brian May started a band called 1984 in the mid-1960s. The band broke up after a short time, then May started another band, teaming up with two fellow college students, Tim Staffell and Roger Taylor. They called themselves Smile (band) with Roger Taylor on drums and vocals, Tim Staffell on vocals and bass, and Brian May on guitar and vocals. They had a few hits such as "April Lady". Tim Staffell became friends with another college student, Farrokh "Freddie" Bulsara (to be later known as Freddie Mercury) and Freddie became a big fan of Smile and encouraged them a lot. Later on, Tim left Smile to join Humpy Bongs and Freddie subsequently joined the band on vocals and piano in 1970. Freddie came up with the name Queen, so they changed it from "Smile" to Queen. They then started auditions for a new bassist. They were going through several bassists during this time and none of them stuck. None of the auditioners managed to suit the place of the new bassist, but finally, in 1971, John Deacon joined the band. Queen's first album was released in 1973 and it was called ''Queen'' with songs such as "Seven Seas of Rhye" and "Liar (song)". Freddie then changed his name to Freddie Mercury after the lyrics "Mother Mercury, look what they've done to me" in the song "My Fairy King". ==Personnel== Freddie Mercury - lead vocals, piano (1970–1991) Paul Rodgers - lead vocals (2004–2009) Adam Lambert - lead vocals (2009–present) Brian May - lead guitar, backing vocals (1970–present) :en:Fred_Mandel - synthesizer, rhythm guitar (1982–1984) :en:Spike_Edney - synthesizer, rhythm guitar (1984–present) Mike Grose - bass guitar (1970–1970) Barry Mitchell - bass guitar (1970–1971) Doug Bougie - bass guitar (1971–1971) John Deacon - bass guitar, rhythm guitar, acoustic guitar, Synthesizer (1971–1997) Neil Fairclough - bass guitar (2011–present) Roger Taylor (Queen drummer) - Drum kit, Percussion instrument, backing vocals (1970–present) Tyler Warren - Percussion instrument (2011–present) ==Album Hits== *''Queen'' – "Keep Yourself Alive" – 1973 *''Queen II'' – "Seven Seas of Rhye"– 1974 *''Sheer Heart Attack'' – "Killer Queen" – 1974 *''A Night at The Opera'' – "Bohemian Rhapsody", "You're My Best Friend (Queen song)", "I'm In Love With My Car– 1975 *''A Day at the Races'' – "Somebody to Love (Queen song), "Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy – 1976 *''News of the World'' – "We Are the Champions / " We Will Rock You" (Double A-side and B-side)– 1977 *''Jazz''– "Bicycle Race" / "Fat Bottomed Girls" (Double A side single), "Don't Stop Me Now"– 1978 *''The Game'' – "Another One Bites the Dust", "Crazy Little Thing Called Love"– 1980 *''Flash Gordon'' – "Flash's Theme" – 1980 *''Hot Space'' – "Under Pressure (Queen song) – 1982 *''The Works'' – "Radio Ga Ga", "I Want To Break Free", "Hammer to Fall– 1984 *''A Kind of Magic'' – "One Vision", "A Kind of Magic (single), "Who Wants to Live Forever"– 1986 *''The Miracle'' – "I Want It All (Queen song)– 1989 *''Innuendo'' – "The Show Must Go On (Queen song), "These Are the Days of Our Lives"– 1991 *''Made in Heaven'' – "Heaven For Everyone" – 1995 *''The Cosmos Rocks'' – "C-lebrity"– 2008 == Studio albums == *''Queen (album)'' (1973) *''Queen II'' (1974) *''Sheer Heart Attack'' (1974) *''A Night at the Opera (Queen album)'' (1975) *''A Day at the Races (album)'' (1976) *''News of the World (album)'' (1977) *''Jazz (album)'' (1978) *''The Game (album)'' (1980) *''Flash Gordon (album)'' (1980) *''Hot Space'' (1982) *''The Works (Queen album)'' (1984) *''A Kind of Magic'' (1986) *''The Miracle (album)'' (1989) *''Innuendo (album)'' (1991) *''Made in Heaven'' (1995) == References == Category:1970 establishments in England Category:1970s British music groups Category:1980s British music groups Category:1990s British music groups Category:2000s British music groups Category:2010s British music groups Category:English rock bands Category:Musical groups established in 1970 Category:Musical groups from London Category:Queen (band)
