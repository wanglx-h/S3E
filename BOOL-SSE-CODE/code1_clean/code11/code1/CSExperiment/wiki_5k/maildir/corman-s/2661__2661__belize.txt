It used to be called ''British Honduras'', but changed its name in 1973. Long before that it was part of the Maya civilization. Belize is the only English language country in Central America. Some people in Belize speak Spanish language or Belizean Kriol language, but English language is the official language and the most commonly spoken. This is because Belize is a former colony of the United Kingdom, while its neighbors were once colonies of Spain. Many people speak two languages. Belize is a melting pot of cultures. More than three hundred and thirty thousand (374,681 (2017)) people live in Belize. Kriols make up about 21% of the Belizean people. Three Maya groups now live in the country: the Yucatec, the Mopan people, and Q'eqchi' people.Cho, Julian (1998).[http://geography.berkeley.edu/projectsresources/MayanAtlas/MayaAtlas/mayahome.htm Maya Homeland] .

After Belize became independent in 1981 the United Kingdom kept some military in the country to protect it from invasion by Guatemala. The main British force left in 1994. This was three years after Guatemala said Belize was independent. The United Kingdom still keeps some military people in the country.Dion E. Phillips, "The Military of Belize" http://www.cavehill.uwi.edu/bnccde/belize/conference/papers/phillips.html, 2002 In 2011 the base was only 10 soldiers due to British budget cuts. They hope to reopen the base later. ==Culture== ===Cuisine=== Belizean cuisine is inspired by British, Mexican and Western Caribbean cooking. Since Belize is a melting pot of culture, it has adopted dishes from many different countries. The basic ingredients are rice and beans.

Exotic ingredients include armadillo meat, venison, iguana, iguana egg, and fried paca. Conch soup is a traditional dish. It has a characteristic taste and thick consistency due to added okra, potatoes, yams, cassava flour and a touch of toasted habanero.
