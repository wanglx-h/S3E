It was in Elis, which is now called Ilia; and is in the east of the city Pyrgos. It was the site of the Ancient Olympic Games in classical times, the most famous games in history. The Olympic Games were held every Olympiad throughout Classical Antiquity, from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. The first Olympic Games were in honour of Zeus. == History == File:Olimpia FilipTemple.JPG]] File:Greece-0585 (2215943566).jpg]] File:Stadio Olimpia 2007.JPG]] Olympia was a sanctuary, consisting of various buildings. These included a hippodrome, Palaestra at Olympia, Gymnasium (ancient Greece) and several temples. The Ancient Olympic Games began here in 776 BC. They were founded by king Pelopas. They happened every four years, in the summers. All the ancient Greek towns competed. The winners of the Olympic games were important people. The Olympic games were abolished in 394 AD by the Christian Roman emperor Theodosius I, who declared that all Pagan religious practices should end. During ancient history, Olympia was a powerful and rich town. It ruled over the west of Peloponnese. Olympia kept its strength and during Ancient Rome period. During the Middle Ages it was an unimportant city. === Gymnasium === The Gymnasium (ancient Greece) at Olympia was a large, open air, quadrangle surrounded on all four sides by colonnades of the Doric order. Only the southern and eastern sides survive. They date to the second century BC. The River Kladeos has destroyed the western side. The gymnasium was used by runners and pentathlon athletes for training. Athletes trained in the Nudity. In bad weather, training took place under the eastern colonnade (210.51 meters) and the other three colonnades. Little of the gymnasium has been excavated. About 200 BC, a portico of the Corinthian order was built to join the gymnasium and the Palaestra at Olympia. === Hippodrome === The Hippodrome was the site of horse and chariot races at Olympia, Greece. It was 1,153 meters long. It was south of the stadium, but none of it survives. It was washed away by the Alpheios River. === Palaestra === == Footnotes == == References == * File:Plan Olympia sanctuary-en.svg – 2: Prytaneion – 3: Philippeion – 4: Temple of Hera, Olympia – 5: Pelopion – 6: Nymphaeum of Herodes Atticus – 7: Metroon – 8: Treasuries at Olympia – 9: Crypt (arched way to the stadium) – 10: Stadium at Olympia – 11: Echo stoa – 12: Building of Ptolemy II and Arsinoe II – 13: Hestia stoa – 14: Hellenistic building – 15: Temple of Zeus, Olympia – 16: Altar of Zeus – 17: Ex-voto of Achaea (ancient region) – 18: Ex-voto of Mikythos – 19: Paeonius – 20: Gymnasium (ancient Greece) – 21: Palaestra at Olympia – 22: Theokoleon – 23: Heroon – 24: Phidias' workshop and paleochristian basilica – 25: Baths of Kladeos – 26: Greek baths – 27 and 28: Hostels – 29: Leonidaion – 30: South baths – 31: Bouleuterion – 32: South stoa – 33: Villa of Nero – I–XII: Treasury ]] Category:Olympia Category:770s BC Category:390s
