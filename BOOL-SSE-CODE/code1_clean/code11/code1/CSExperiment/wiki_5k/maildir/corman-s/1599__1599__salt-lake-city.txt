It is the capital (city) and largest city of the state of Utah. It was founded by the The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and is the official headquarters of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It is named after the Great Salt Lake, which it is near. The city's population was 199,723 in 2020. The city was founded in 1847 by Brigham Young and his Mormon followers. They extensively irrigated and cultivated the arid valley. Due to its proximity to the Great Salt Lake, the city was originally named "Great Salt Lake City"–the word "great" was dropped from the official name in 1868. Although Salt Lake City is still home to the headquarters of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), less than half the population of Salt Lake City proper is Mormon today.[https://www.pbs.org/mormons/faqs/structure.html PBS American Experience. "The Mormons" (2007-04-30)] Immigration of international LDS members, Mining, and the construction of the First Transcontinental Railroad initially brought economic growth, and the city was nicknamed the "Crossroads of the West". It was traversed by the Lincoln Highway, the first transcontinental highway, in 1913, and presently two major cross-country freeways, Interstate 15 and Interstate 80, intersect in the city. Salt Lake City has since developed a strong outdoor activity tourist industry based primarily on skiing. It was host to the 2002 Winter Olympics. It is the industrial loan company center of the United States.[http://www.fdic.gov/regulations/examinations/supervisory/insights/sisum04/industrial_loans.html FDIC Industrial Banks].

In the last part of the 19th century, there was much controversy over how children in the area should be educated. LDS and non-LDS parents could not agree on the level of religious influence in schools. Today, many LDS youths in grades 9 through 12 attend some form of religious instruction, referred to as Church Educational System#Seminaries. Students are released from public schools at various times of the day to attend seminary.[http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/home/50172502-76/corroon-herbert-education-governor.html.csp Guv claims Corroon could eliminate LDS seminary | The Salt Lake Tribune] LDS seminaries are usually located on church-owned property adjacent to the public school and within walking distance. File:City and County Building SLC - circa 1894.jpg, seat of city government since 1894. It also served as Utah's first statehouse from 1896 until the current Utah State Capitol was dedicated on October 9, 1916.]] Because of high birth rates and large classrooms, Utah spends less per student than any other state. At the same time, Utah spends more per capita than any state with the exception of Alaska. Recently, money was approved for the reconstruction of more than half of the elementary schools and one of the middle schools in the Salt Lake City School District, which serves most of the area within the city limits. There are twenty-three K-6 elementary schools, five 7-8 middle schools, three 9-12 high schools (Highland, East, and West, with the former South High School (Salt Lake City) being converted to the South City campus of the Salt Lake Community College), and an alternative high school (Horizonte) located within the school district. In addition, Highland has recently been selected as the site for the charter school Salt Lake School for the Performing Arts (SPA). Many Catholic schools are located in the city, including Judge Memorial High School. Rowland Hall-St. Mark's School, established in 1867 by Episcopal Church (United States) Bishop Daniel Tuttle,Quinn, Frederick ''Building the "Goodly Fellowship of Faith" - A History of the Episcopal Church in Utah - 1867-1996'' Utah State University Press, Logan, Utah, 2004, chapter 1. is the area's premier independent school. The Salt Lake City Public Library system consists of the main library downtown, and five branches in various neighborhoods. The main library, designed by renowned architect Moshe Safdie, opened in 2003. In 2006, the Salt Lake City Public Library was named "Library of the Year" by the American Library Association.[http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6341871.html Library Journal article: Library of the Year] Colleges in Salt Lake City include the University of Utah, Westminster College, Salt Lake City, Salt Lake Community College, Stevens-Henager College, Eagle Gate College, The Art Institute of Salt Lake City and LDS Business College. Utah State University and BYU Salt Lake Center also operate education centers in the city. There are also many trade and technical schools such as Healing Mountain Massage School and the Utah College of Massage Therapy. The University of Utah has good research and medical programs. It was one of the original four universities to be connected to ARPANET, the predecessor to the Internet, in 1969, and was also the site of the first artificial heart heart transplantation in 1982. ==Events== * 1847 - The Mormon pioneers first arrive to settle Utah. * 2002 - The 2002 Winter Olympics were held in Salt Lake City. ==References== Category:Salt Lake City Category:County seats in Utah Category:State capitals in the United States Category:Olympic cities Category:1847 establishments in the United States Category:19th-century establishments in Utah
