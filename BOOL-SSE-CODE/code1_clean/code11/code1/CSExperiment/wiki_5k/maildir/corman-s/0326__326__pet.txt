A '''pet''' is a domestication animal that lives with people, but is not forced to Labour (economics) and is not eaten, in most instances. In most cases, a pet is kept to entertain people or for companionship. Some pets such as dogs and cats are placed in an animal shelter if there is no one willing to take care of them. If no one adopts it or the pet is too old/sick, the pet may be euthanized or in some cases even abandoned. Dogs, cats, fish, rodents, Lagomorpha, ferrets, birds, certain Reptile and Amphibian, and a wide variety of Arthropod such as Tarantula and Hermit crab are the most common pets in North America. Horses, elephants, oxen, and donkeys are usually made to work, so they are not usually called pets. Some dogs also do work for people, and it was once common for some birds (like falcons and carrier pigeons) to work for humans. Rodents are very popular pets. The most common are guinea pigs, hamsters (especially Syrian hamster and dwarf hamsters), mouse and rats. Rabbits are also very popular pets. Bloomberg News Intelligence estimated that the pet care market across the world was worth $320 billion in 2024 and growing rapidly. == Common Pets == {| class="wikitable" !Image !Name |- |File:Long-haired Dachshund Portrait.jpg |Dog (member of Canines) |- |File:Junger schwarzer Hauskater im liegen 4.jpg |Cat (member of Felines) |- |File:Goldfish (3230447522).jpg |Goldfish (member of Fishes) |- |File:Brown mouse.jpg |Mouse (member of Rodents) |- |File:Wild rabbit us.jpg |Rabbit (member of Lagomorphs) |- |File:Photo of Roborovski Hamster.jpg |Hamster (member of Rodents) |- |File:Guinea pig Lucas.JPG |Guinea pig (member of Rodents) |- |File:Pet parrot named Alexander (Amazona aestiva).jpg |Parrot (member of Birds) |} ==Related pages== * Domestication ==References== 2.
