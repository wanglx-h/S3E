Subject: Etymology
'''Etymology''' is the study of the origin and meaning of words and names. It tells us how words have changed over time, and what other languages they came from. For example, the etymology of the word ''etymology'' is from the Greek language words ἔτυμον (''étymon'', "true meaning", from ''etymos'' "true") and λόγος (''lógos'', "word" or "study"). == References == == Bibliography == * Ghil'ad Zuckermann (2003). :en: Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew.
