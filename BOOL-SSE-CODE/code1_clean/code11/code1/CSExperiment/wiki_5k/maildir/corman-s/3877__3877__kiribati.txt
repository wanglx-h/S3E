It has 33 atolls, groups of tiny islands. The country is near the equator. Part of it is in Micronesia and part is in Polynesia. Its capital (city) is South Tarawa, on the Tarawa atoll. Kiribati used to be called the '''Gilbert Islands'''. The name "Kiribati" comes from the way local people say "Gilberts". In 1892, the Gilbert Islands became a Great Britain protectorate with the Ellice Islands (now known as Tuvalu), together called Gilbert and Ellice Islands. Kiribati became an independence republic in 1979. Tourism is an important industry. Most food comes from farming and fishing. People grow breadfruit, papayas, coconuts, sweet potatoes, and vegetables. The soil is not very good, but people use a special way of composting to make it better. The official languages of Kiribati are English language and Gilbertese language. ==People== As of 2020, about 119,000 people live in Kiribati. This is up from 103,000 in 2010, 84,000 in 2000, and 72,000 in 1990. Of these people, 90% live on the Gilbert Islands, 10% live on the Phoenix Islands, and only 41 people live on the Line Islands. The government says that 59% of people live in urban areas. Almost all people in Kiribati have a religion. The largest religions are Catholicism (59%), Kiribati Uniting Church (21%), Kiribati Protestant Church (8%), The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (5%), Bahai (2%), and Seventh-day Adventist (2%). ==History== The first people came to Kiribati sometime between 3000 BCMacdonald, Barrie (2001) ''Cinderellas of the Empire: towards a history of Kiribati and Tuvalu'', Institute of Pacific Studies, University of the South Pacific, Suva, Fiji, , p. 1 and 1300 AD. It is not known where they came from. Before this time, the islands may have been underwater. European sailors saw the islands in the 1600s and 1700s. At this time, people only lived on the Gilbert Islands. (These islands were named after a British sailor, Thomas Gilbert.) In the 1800s, Europeans kidnapping many people and sold them as slaves. In 1886, the British Empire took the islands. The British tried to settle the Phoenix and Line Islands. During World War II, Japan took the islands. During the Cold War, the US tested nuclear weapons there. In 1979, Kiribati became independent. Kiribati signed a "Treaty of Friendship and Territorial Sovereignty" (also called the "Treaty of Tarawa") with the United States in 1979. The USA gave up its claims to the islands of Canton, Enderbury, Hull, Birnie, Gardner, Phoenix, Sydney, McKean, Christmas, Caroline Island, Starbuck Island, Malden Island, Flint, and Vostok in that treaty. ==Climate change== Global warming and climate change are having big effects on Kiribati. The islands are very low above the water. The average height is 3 metres above sea level. Because of global warming, the sea level is rising. Land is sinking under the ocean. In the future, there may not be enough land to grow food. Salt water is also filling up aquifers, where people store fresh water. Climate change causes unusual droughts and storms. These can make farming much harder. In 2012, the government purchased land on Fiji. This way, people from Kiribati could move there if needed. ==References== ==Other websites== Category:Kiribati Category:Least developed countries Category:1979 establishments Category:Commonwealth member states Category:English-speaking countries
