She is one of the Twelve Olympians. Athena's symbol is the owl. She has a shield called Aegis, a gift from Zeus. Athena is often shown wearing her helmet and holding her shield. The shield later had Medusa head on it, given to Athena by Perseus after he killed Medusa. Athena is also the protector of Athens, Greece, a city named after her. The Parthenon, on the Acropolis in Athens, is her most famous temple. She is also seen with Nike (mythology), the goddess of victory. == Folklore == ===Birth=== In Hesiod's ''Theogony'', Zeus married Metis. The Oracle of Delphi said Metis would give birth to Athena and a son who would overthrow Zeus, just as Zeus overthrew Kronos, and Kronos overthrew his father Uranos. To prevent this, Zeus swallowed Metis while she was pregnant. Inside Zeus's head, Metis made a helmet, armor, and a robe for Athena, causing Zeus severe headaches. Hephaestus split Zeus's head open, and Athena emerged fully grown and armored. ===Lady of Athens=== As a war goddess, Athena fought alongside Greek heroes. Athena is considered the protector of the safety of kings, meaning she safeguards the wellbeing and security of kings. She offers wisdom and strategic counsel to keep them safe. Athens was a powerful sea force, winning against the Achaemenid Empire fleet at the Battle of Salamis. In another legend, Poseidon gave the Athenians their first horse, while Athena gave them the first olive tree. Athena was declared the patron goddess of Athens. The olive tree brought wood, oil, and food, becoming a symbol of Athenian growth. ===Patron of heroes=== Athena helped heroes like Jason and the Argonauts, and Perseus in his quest to kill Medusa. She gave Perseus tools to kill Medusa, such as her polished bronze shield. According to Pindar's ''Thirteenth Olympian Ode'', Athena helped Bellerophon tame the winged horse Pegasus by giving him a Bit (horse).Pindar, ''Olympian Ode'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0162%3Abook%3DO.%3Apoem%3D13 13.75–78] == Titles == '''Athena''', or '''Athene''', is the Greek gods of knowledge, purity, arts, crafts, learning, justice, and wisdom. She is often shown as a warrior goddess who uses her intelligence and strategic thinking to overcome challenges. Athenians believed she helped them win the Trojan war. Athena often helped hero who were not just brave but also clever, like Jason and Perseus. People joined her religion, hoping for victory. She is also credited with creating the olive tree and flute. Athena was also the patron goddess of other cities, including Pergamon. The various titles of Athena are often seen with rites of passage for Grecian youth. Athena's title "Pallas" (meaning "young woman" or "maiden") symbolizes youth and vigor. In military training or initiation ceremonies, she represents wisdom, courage, and strategic thinking. "Athena Parthenos" (meaning "Athena the Virgin") emphasizes her independence and purity. These titles highlight the qualities expected of young men and women entering adulthood. Athena was frequently confused with Aphaea, a local goddess of Aegina, Artemis, and the nymph Britomartis. In Arcadia, she was worshiped as Athena Alea. Temples to Athena Alea were located in Mantineia and Tegea. The temple of Athena Alea in Tegea was an important center of ancient Greece. Pausanias (geographer) wrote that the ''temenos'' was founded by Athena.Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' viii.4.8. Athena also has the title Ergane as the patron of craftsmen and artisans. As "Parthenos," she was worshiped in the festivals of the Panathenaea and Pamboeotia. As "Promachos," she led in battle. As "Polias," she was the protector of many cities, including Athens, Argos, Sparta, Gortyn, Lindos, and Larisa. === ''Glaukopis'' === Athena's most common form is '''' ().pis|γλαυκῶπις|shortref}}. The word combines '''' (, meaning "gleaming, silvery" or "bluish-green" or "gray"). and '''' (, "eye, face").. ==Historical origins== According to Greek mythology, Athena was born from the head of her father, Zeus. There are two main versions of her birth: * Parthenogenesis: Athena is born without a mother, emerging fully grown and armored from Zeus' forehead. This emphasizes her independence and wisdom from birth. * Metis: In Hesiod's "Theogony," Zeus swallowed Metis, who was pregnant with Athena, to prevent a prophecy that his child would overthrow him. Later, Athena was born from Zeus' head, fully grown and wearing armor. Athena's association with Athens comes from a myth where she competed with Poseidon to be the city's patron deity. She won by offering the olive tree, symbolizing peace and prosperity. ==Modern representations== File:Hellen altar.png]] One of Sigmund Freud's most valued items was a small, bronze statue of Athena on his desk. Freud described Athena as "a woman who is unapproachable and holds off all sexual desires." Feminism views on Athena vary: some admire her for her strength, independence, and wisdom, while others critique her alignment with patriarchal values. Athena, the Greek goddess of wisdom and strategic thinking, is a natural patron of universities because she embodies the pursuit of knowledge and critical thinking. At Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania, a statue of Athena lives in the Great Hall. Students leave offerings to the goddess during exams for good luck or forgiveness. A statue of Athena stands in front of the Parliament in Vienna. A full-scale replica of the Parthenon stands in Nashville, Tennessee, with a forty-two-foot (12.5 m) tall Phidias added in 1990. The Great Seal of California features Athena kneeling next to a brown grizzly bear. Athena often appears on modern coins. ==Family tree== |border_AAA=0}} }} |BBB=b }} ==Notes== ==References== == Related pages == * Menrva - Etruscan mythology version of Athena. * Minerva - Roman mythology version of Athena. == Other websites == * [https://en.citizendium.org/wiki/Athena Athena] -Citizendium Category:Twelve Olympians Category:National personifications Category:Virgin goddesses Category:National symbols of Greece
