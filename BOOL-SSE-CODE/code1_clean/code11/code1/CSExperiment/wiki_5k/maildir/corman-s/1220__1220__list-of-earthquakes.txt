Earthquakes' effects were once measured after the Mercalli scale, which regards the practical damages that a seismic event causes to infrastructures and houses, and a sort of comparison between the two scale is now in use, especially for ancient events.'' == Other websites == *[http://wwwneic.cr.usgs.gov/neis/bulletin/ USGS list of current earthquakes] *[http://earthquakescanada.nrcan.gc.ca/index-eng.php Earthquakes Canada] *[http://www.geonet.org.nz/recent_quakes.html Recent New Zealand earthquakes] Category:Earthquakes Category:Science-related lists
