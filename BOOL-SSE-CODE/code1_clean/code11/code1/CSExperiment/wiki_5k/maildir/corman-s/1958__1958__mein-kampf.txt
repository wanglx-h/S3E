File:FrMeinKampf20050214.jpg '''''Mein Kampf''''' () is a book written by Adolf Hitler and Rudolf Hess. Rudolf Hess helped Hitler write the book, but he is not mentioned as an author. ==Parts== There are two parts to ''Mein Kampf.'' Hitler wrote the first while he was in jail in Landsberg am Lech. He had been put in jail after a failed ''putsch'' in 1923. He wrote the second part after his (early) release from jail. From 1926 to 1930, both volumes were sold separately, at the price of 12 Reichsmark each. Starting in 1930, both volumes were published as one book. ==Importance== In the book, Hitler describes his view of greater Germany and his future plan for Jews. After coming to power in 1933, Hitler put some of those plans into action and initiated the Holocaust, the worst genocide in history. The book was given away for free at civil registry offices while the Nazis had power in Germany. In part, the book was propaganda, and giving it away free was a way to recruit members. ''Mein Kampf'' has been called the "most evil book in history". Historians and journalists who have read it have also criticized the quality of Hitler's writing.Schlamm, William S.

By Adolf Hitler. Translated by Ralph Manheim. 694 pp. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company. $3.50."] ''The New York Times'' ==Editions== Several editions of ''Mein Kampf'' were published between 1925 and 1945. Each new edition included revised text intended to clarify information in past editions. Most likely, ghostwriters around Hitler did this work. After the World War II, it became illegal to reprint or sell new copies of ''Mein Kampf'' in Germany and Austria (Hitler's country of birth). It is not illegal to own the book, sell used copies, or buy used copies. ==Summary== * Hitler wanted to unite Austria with Germany. The ''annexation,'' or "Anschluß," took place in 1938. The sympathetic Austrian government asked Hitler to annex Austria to be part of the "Großdeutsche Reich" (The Greater German Reich). * Several Antisemitism beliefs in the book are developed. Special care is taken to portray Marxism as something very bad which had been a Jewish creation. * The concept of nationally oriented socialism (''Nationalsozialismus'', which is where the Allied word ''Nazi'' (National Sozialistishe) comes from as they did not call themselves Nazi's). A war should be a war of races, not one of the different classes of society against each other. From this conflict, sympathy from German working class could be amassed. * The political system of the Soviet Union referred to as Bolshevik should be split into parts. This should be done through what is called a war of the race (sociology)s (''Rassenkrieg'' in German). * According to the book there is not enough space for the German People to live. Winning such a race war would give the people (of "Aryan" blood) more space to live (Lebensraum), in the east. (At the time the book was written Germany was roughly the size of Texas). * Germany should not fight a war on two fronts. Resultingly, England would be a good strategic partner in a war to come. * Parliamentary or Democracy governments should be replaced with a state where a single leader makes decisions. This was believed to be more in the interest of the people. * The structure of the NSDAP, as outlined in the second volume is developed. * Some autobiographic stories, and a history of the NSDAP, both till 1924. ==Related pages== * Anti-Judaism and antisemitism * ''The Protocols of the Elders of Zion'' ==References== Category:Nazism Category:Racism Category:Fascism Category:1925 books Category:Nationalism Category:Adolf Hitler Category:Antisemitism Category:Discrimination Category:Disinformation Category:Political books Category:History of Europe Category:History of Germany Category:Antisemitism in Europe Category:Antisemitism in Germany
