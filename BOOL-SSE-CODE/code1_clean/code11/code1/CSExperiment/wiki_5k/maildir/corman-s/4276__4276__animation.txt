File:Animexample.gif '''Animation''' is a way of making a movie from many images that don’t move. The images are put together one after another, and then played at a fast speed to give the illusion of movement. A person who makes animations is called an ''animator.'' One of the first animators was Emile Cohl who made a Short movie called Fantasmagorie which was made entirely of his drawings but which made the drawings move. Cohl made it in 1908. There are at least three ways to animate: # Drawing each frame # Use stop-motion: make a Scale model scene and change it to create a new image (frame) # Make computer graphicsFile:Blender3D CircularWaveAnim.gifs made by an underwater explosion.|alt=Many of these images are called "GIF's" (pronounced Jif)]] == Overview == File:Joy Heron - Animated CGI Spot by Passion Pictures.webm Because it is expensive to make, most animation comes from professional company. However, independent movie animators have existed since the 1950s in America, with many of those people entering the professional industry. In Europe, the independent moments has existed since the 1910s, with animators like pre-revolutionary Russia's Ladislas Starevich and Germany's Lotte Reiniger. Many people use a computer animation program called Adobe Flash to create animations. Flash uses a combination of drawing and computer graphics to make animations. Many animations on the internet are made in Flash. Most animators on the internet do not work for professional companies. Many television shows, especially those made for children, use limited animation. Companies such as UPA and Hanna-Barbera Productions do this. Simple, limited movement makes the images easier to draw, which allows faster and cheaper film production of animation. Usually, cartoons are hand drawn and short. Cartoons be a TV series, or theatrical shorts. The running time of an animated feature is more than one hour. Animated features can be hand drawn, stop motion, or computer animated. == Famous names in the business == * Tex Avery * Ralph Bakshi * Joseph Barbera * Brad Bird * Seth McFarlane * Don Bluth * Sylvain Chomet * Gabor Csupo * Stephen Hillenburg * Gene Deitch * Walt Disney * Adam Elliot * Max Fleischer * Friz Freleng * Matt Groening * Yoram Gross * William Hanna * Ray Harryhausen * Ub Iwerks * Henry Selick * Chuck Jones * Mike Judge * Glen Keane * Arlene Klasky * Walter Lantz * John Lasseter * Winsor McCay * Norman McLaren * Hayao Miyazaki * Yuriy Norshteyn * Katsuhiro Otomo * Nick Park * Trey Parker * Bill Plympton * Matt Stone * Will Vinton * Bob Clampett * Richard Williams == Famous animation studios == === United States === * DePatie-Freleng Enterprises * DreamWorks SKG *Nickelodeon Movies * Film Roman * Filmation * Hanna-Barbera (now Cartoon Network Studios) *Sony Pictures Animation * Klasky Csupo * MGM *Reel FX Creative Studios *Laika (company) * Pixar *Blue Sky Studios *Illumination Entertainment * UPA * Walt Disney Pictures * Warner Bros. *Warner Animation Group === Canada === * Atkinson Film-Arts * Cinar (now Cookie Jar Entertainment) * CinéGroupe * National Film Board of Canada * Nelvana === Europe === * Aardman Animations (United Kingdom) * Arsyn Video Interactive (France) * Belvision (Belgium) * Centre for Animated Films Cacak (Serbia) * Chromosomos (Spain) * Cosgrove Hall Films (United Kingdom) * CreaSyn Studio (France) * DIC (France) * Ellipse Programme (France) * France Animation (France) * Grand Slamm Children's Films (United Kingdom) * kaViArt (France) * MacGuff (France) * Pannónia Filmstúdió (Hungary) * Red 3ye Productions (France) * Soyuzmultfilm (Russia) * Sullivan Bluth Studios (Ireland) * Synthĕsis Animation Studio (France) * Zagreb Film (Croatia) === Asia === ==== Japan ==== * Bandai Visual * BONES * GAINAX * Gonzo (studio) * Kyoto Animation * Madhouse Studios * Production I.G. * Pierrot (studio) * Studio Ghibli * Sunrise * Tatsunoko Productions * Toei ==== China ==== * Beijing Xie Art (mainland) * Colorland (Hong Kong) * Wang Film Productions (Taiwan) ==== Philippines ==== * Toon City === Australia === * DisneyToon Studios * Liquid Animation * Yoram Gross Films / Flying Bark Productions == Related pages == * Anime * Cartoon * CGI animation * Movie * Stop-Motion * CGI ImageMovers And PlayTone Category:Animation
