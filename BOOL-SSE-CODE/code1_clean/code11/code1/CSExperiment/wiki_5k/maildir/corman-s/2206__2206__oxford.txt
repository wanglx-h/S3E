It is on the River Thames. It is a very old city. It is the 52nd largest city in the United Kingdom. Some of its buildings were built before the 12th century. It is famous for its university, Oxford University, which is the oldest university in the English-speaking world. About 150,200 live in Oxford. Two rivers run through the city, the Cherwell and the Thames. These two rivers meet south of the city centre. Besides its university, there are some buildings famous for their architecture (the style in which they were built), like the Radcliffe Camera. There are also lots of museums and other places for tourists to visit. The south and east of the city are less wealthy and have fewer students. Cowley used to be a separate town and has a large car factory, and Blackbird Leys is an area of mainly council housing. == Transport == Oxford railway station is in the centre of the city and Oxford Parkway station is on the outskirts of the city. The small Oxford Airport is nearby. The Oxford Ring Road surrounds the inner city. Vehicles that burn fuel and enter a Zero Emissions Zone in the City Centre in daytime must pay a fee. == References == == Other websites == * [http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/Oxford Oxford] - Citizendium Category:County towns in England Category:Oxford
