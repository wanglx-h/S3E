He served as president from 1849 until he died in 1850. He was a second cousin to James Madison. He was the first person elected to the presidency without any political experience. ==General years== Taylor was a general in the United States Army. He led an army during the Mexican-American War. He was selected by the Whigs to be their candidate because he was a famous general. He was the last President to own slaves while in office. ==Presidency== During his term, slavery was a big issue because the Northerners wanted no slavery in the U.S. and wanted to stop newly formed states from allowing slavery. The Southerners believed that they had the right to keep their slaves and people feared that they would choose to not be a part of the United States anymore (which they would eventually do in 1860). Taylor did not like the idea of the southern states leaving the United States at all. He threatened to use military force against them if they were to do that. Taylor never voted until he was 62 years old. He was never a resident of a particular location in the United States long enough to register to vote. Sixteen months into his presidency, Taylor died of cholera and his vice-president Millard Fillmore became president to take his place. The Compromise of 1850 (a proposal of several laws that would calm down the slavery issue by pleasing both the North and the South) was voted on in Congress shortly after his death. This was negotiated by Kentucky's Congressman, Henry Clay, who was a distant cousin of the Taylors and Lincolns. == References == == Other websites == * [http://www.whitehouse.gov/history/presidents/zt12.html Taylor's White House biography] Category:1784 births Category:1850 deaths Category:Deaths from stroke Category:Politicians from Virginia Category:Military people from Virginia Category:Zachary Taylor Category:19th-century American politicians Category:19th-century presidents of the United States
