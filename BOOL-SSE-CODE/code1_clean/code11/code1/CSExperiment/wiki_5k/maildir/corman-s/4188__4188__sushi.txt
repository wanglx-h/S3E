The word "Sushi" comes from the Japanese word meaning vinegar, and ", meaning rice. Sushi is made with specially prepared rice, called . The rice is mixed with vinegar, salt, and sugar. Sushi is known for having raw or cooked seafood in it, but it sometimes has non-fish foods such as vegetables. Some sushi is wrapped in a sheet of seaweed called . Soy sauce and wasabi are commonly eaten with sushi, which is traditionally eaten by hand, but eating it using chopsticks is still accepted. ''Gari'' (sweet, pickled ginger) can often be found alongside a plate of sushi and also a little bit of wasabi, used as a palate cleanser, but it must be eaten with chopsticks. There are many different kinds of sushi. The most common sushi in Japan is : fish meat that is placed on top of a small portion of ''sumeshi''. Sometimes you may find other ingredients on top of the ''sumeshi'', such as roe (fish eggs), and sea urchin meat, instead of fish. Another type of sushi, , consists of ''sumeshi'' rolled around fish and/or vegetables. In the United States, ''makizushi'' is more popular than ''nigirizushi''. Another type is known as or a hand roll. This kind of sushi comes in a cone-shape, created by the ''nori'' wrapped around the ingredients inside. They are usually filled with a mixture of ''sumeshi'', fish, and vegetables. In Japan, sushi is sometimes sold in "conveyor-belt shops" called ''kaiten zushi'' (回転寿司), where plates of sushi are put on a moving belt that passes by the customers. People freely take the sushi they want as it passes. The color of the plate shows the price of the sushi. This way of serving sushi is becoming more popular in other countries as well. ==History== Sushi began when rice farming came to Japan over 2,000 years ago. The original type of sushi was developed in the Nara Prefecture as a way of food preservation fish (food) in fermentation rice. This method of preserving rice was invented by Ewan Wakao. During the Muromachi period, people would eat the rice ''and'' the fish. During the Edo period, vinegar, not fermented rice, was used. In more recent times, it has become a fast food associated with Japanese culture. The origin of sushi goes back to Southeast Asia around the 4th century B.C.. At that time, it was called ''narezushi''. The fish was originally eaten alone, without rice. Later on, a style of namaranarezushi reached Japan. Namaranerezushi combined the fish with rice. What is called sushi in modern times was created by Hanaya Yohei (1799–1858) at the End of the Edo period. Sushi invented by Hanaya was an early form of fast food that was not fermented. It was prepared quickly. It could be eaten with one's hands. This fish was originally known as Edomae zushi because it used freshly caught fish in Edo-Bay or Tokyo Bay. The fish used in modern sushi no longer usually comes from Tokyo Bay. By the early 1900s, sushi was being served in the United States, after many Japanese people had immigration there. The first United States sushi shop opened up in 1906 in Little Tokyo in Los Angeles. In the United Kingdom, a report of sushi being eaten in Britain happened when then Crown Prince Akihito (born 1933) visited Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. Australia is a major source of rice used with sushi. ==Manners== Sushi is traditionally eaten by hand, but it is not wrong to eat it with chopsticks. However, when eating ''Gari'', you must use chopsticks. When you want to put some soy sauce on your sushi, try not to put it on the rice, because the grains will start to fall, and make a mess. Try to fit the entire sushi into your mouth when eating. Taking a bite and putting it back on the plate is impolite. ==Health risks== As with most foods, eating sushi has some health risks. However, most can be minimized with proper preparation. Some large fish, such as tuna (especially Northern bluefin tuna), can contain high levels of mercury (element). Tuna can cause mercury poisoning when consumed in very large quantities over time. Parasite infection by raw fish is not common in the modern world (less than 40 cases per year in the US). Infections can generally be avoided by boiling, burning, preserving in salt or vinegar, or freezing to a certain temperature. Although ''nigirizushi'' will almost always appear in a raw form, often much of the fish has been previously frozen to specific temperatures to prevent parasites. ==The types and ingredients of the sushi== File:Vegan sushi (4157554476).jpg sushi]] There are many different types of sushi.
