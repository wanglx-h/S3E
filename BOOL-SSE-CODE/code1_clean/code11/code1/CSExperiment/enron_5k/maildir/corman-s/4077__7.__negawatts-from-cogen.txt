Richard, Here is my first take on the analysis you wanted and acc't numbers. Please do not show this to anyone before we talk. I need to get to a meeting in Boston now so I don't have time to write something up which I need to do. So please keep this just between us. I'll call you this afternoon. Thanks, Bill
