Good morning sweatheart. Its really hard for me to be away from you. I think about you all the time. I love to sleep next to you and wake up with you in the morning. I really wanted to stay with you Saturday night. Maybe I can work something out for this weekend. Love you. -----Original Message----- From: Harris, Steven Sent: Monday, October 22, 2001 8:39 AM To: Geaccone, Tracy Subject: Hi beautiful. I had a hard time yesterday because I missed you so much (in case you couldn't tell). The more we are together the more I love you and want to spend all my time with you. I can't wait to see you. Stan's staff meeting was cancelled so I am just trying to catch up on things this morning. Love you sweetie.
