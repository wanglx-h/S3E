Subject: Outstanding Reservation Invoice
Jimmy, we could use a helping hand in collecting about $518 K from Orlando Cogen for their January reservation billing. Marion has called them on several occasions this week and they simply are not responding to her messages. We have several small customers we're still chasing, but Orlando is the most significant outstanding issue we have left. Could you give me a call in the morning so we can discuss. Thks! Sheila
