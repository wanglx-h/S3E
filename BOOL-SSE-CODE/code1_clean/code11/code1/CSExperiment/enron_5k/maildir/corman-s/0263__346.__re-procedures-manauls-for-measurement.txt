I don't have them, but I think Don Hawkins said he did have them. -----Original Message----- From: Barnes, Caroline Sent: Wed 3/6/2002 4:59 PM To: Hayslett, Rod Cc: Corman, Shelley Subject: Procedures Manauls for Measurement Rod, Shelley mentioned that you indicated there were written procedures that we needed to check to see if being followed in regards to Measurement. A lot of new procedures came out of the Continuous Improvement effort and I have a copy of some. Is this what you are referring to? Do you happen to have a complete copy of the final report from all the areas? cvb
