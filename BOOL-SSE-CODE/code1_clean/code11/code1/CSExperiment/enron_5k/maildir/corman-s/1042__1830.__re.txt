Letting him stir is good in some ways but guys actually tend to like a lack of clarity in relationships as it gives them more leeway. However, I don't really know the dynamic in your relationship at all. So Angela and I made up from our huge saturday morning fight before I left on Sunday and she cried like a baby when i left. I feel so bad leaving her. She is really broken hearted right now.
