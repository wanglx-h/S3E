Subject: Re: RTO West/PRRQ -- RRG Meeting
Hello -- I just wanted to confirm that the work of the PRRQ has been suspended until further notice. (At a minimum the meetings in April will not take place.) In April, the RTO West Stage 2 Development Process will focus on congestion management, contract conversion, liability issues, and limited seams work (although there might some other isolated activity as well). Thanks! I look forward to when the PRRQ restarts! Kristi "Kristi M.
