Subject: Re: Confidential Draft - David Pope
Tara, You are right -- those changes were not included. For Vice President level employees, corporate comp.does not promote guaranteed performance bonuses. The request that he be able to "get out" of his employment contract if he is not promoted also is not something that we can do; otherwise, it will undermine the enforceability of our non-competes across the board. I spoke with David Oxley on both of those points, and he concurred that these changes could not be made.

Am I missing this or can we not put this in? 2)Danny McCarty wanted guaranteed bonus for 2000 rather than performance target bonus as per email. Is this possible? Thanks Tara
