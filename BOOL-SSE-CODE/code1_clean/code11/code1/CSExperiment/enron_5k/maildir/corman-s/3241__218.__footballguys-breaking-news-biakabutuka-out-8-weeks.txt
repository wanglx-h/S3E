Subject: [Footballguys] BREAKING NEWS - Biakabutuka OUT 8 Weeks
Hi Folks, Breaking News for you and wanted to let you know: Bob Berger and Bruce Murray just reported on Sporting News Radio that Carolina RB Tshimanga Biakabutuka is out 8 weeks with a broken foot. Not naming a RB yet and it's pretty muddled there. Richard Huntley and Nick Goings had been running earlier this year but today, Brad Hoover was the other RB to share time with Biakabutuka. None of these guys get's anyone too excited. More as we hear it. Joe /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Bryant Analytics, Inc.
