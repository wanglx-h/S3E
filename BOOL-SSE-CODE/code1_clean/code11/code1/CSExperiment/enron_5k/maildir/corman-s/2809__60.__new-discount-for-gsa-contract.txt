Subject: New Discount for GSA Contract
Britt, I know this may seem silly but for the record, the electricity discount for all financial and physical commodity deals per the GSA Contract increases to 3.5% from 2.7%. This means that for all the accounts which we currently service, we need to update the computer discount rate from the old rate (2.7%) to the new rate (3.5%). Please give me a call if you have questions and certainly let me know if this is a problem. Thanks and I hope your holidays were relaxing....., Bill
