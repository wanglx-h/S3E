Subject: NLRB Ruling
Privileged and Confidential This email contains legal advice and confidentiality should be maintained The attached memo describes a recent decision from the National Labor Relations Board regarding an employee's right to be "represented" by a co-worker or other person during a disciplinary meeting. Employees in unionized settings always have had this right, but it now has been extended by the NLRB's ruling. The ruling was contentious -- there were dissents -- and I expect it to be appealed quickly. Nonetheless, if an Enron employee wants to have someone sit in on a disciplinary meeting, please call me to discuss how to proceed before responding to that request. We want to be careful to avoid a finding of an unfair labor practice. Thanks.
