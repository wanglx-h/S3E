Subject: CA FERC Filings
We got through our firestorm for today. A bunch of filings on Thursday is next. I asked Jim if Joe Hartsoe needs to sign off on each filing no matter how small. He said that there is no hard and fast rule -- use good judgement basically. Joe needs to know about each filing. He should be given time to review the bigger pleadings, but for smaller ones a heads up may be all that is necessary. Hope this helps. Sue Mara Enron Corp. Tel: (415) 782-7802 Fax:(415) 782-7854
