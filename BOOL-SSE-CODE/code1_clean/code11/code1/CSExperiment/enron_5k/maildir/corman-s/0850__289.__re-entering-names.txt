Subject: RE: entering names
That must be frustrating. I've asked HR to address this problem. -----Original Message----- From: Reid, Byron Sent: Wednesday, November 21, 2001 12:58 AM To: PepSupport; Bryant, Mike; Bellard, Dannis; Corman, Shelley Subject: entering names Upon entering names and ALL the other info we are suppose to enter on submitting names for our evaluations I got a message saying "no records found matching your criteria". I tried a couple of names and got the same msg. Therefore I cannot start this process. Byron Reid
