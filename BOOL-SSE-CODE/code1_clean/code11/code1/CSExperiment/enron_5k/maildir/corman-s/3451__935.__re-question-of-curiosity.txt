Subject: RE: question of curiosity!!!
Mary and Dari, here is my answer. Are you comfortable with it before I send it to the shipper. Thanks. Lynn Answer: If an interruptible shipper is bumped in the Intraday 1 cycle, the shipper will keep 1/3 of their scheduled volumes. Shippers schedule becomes their actual unless they are the operator of the point. Therefore, they would not encounter a DDVC penalty. If the Shipper is the operator, NNG looks at total scheduled volumes vs total actual delivered volumes and determines if a DDVC is appropriate. The DDVC is based on the difference between total scheduled and the actual delivery at the point. If you have any additional questions, please do not hesitate to give me a call.

Lynn, Steve, When Gary post the SOL or SUL this verbiage goes along with the critical notice: DDVC penalties are applicable to the bumped shipper's quantity.
