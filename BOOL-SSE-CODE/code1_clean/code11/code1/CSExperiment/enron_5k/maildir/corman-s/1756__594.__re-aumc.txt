Yes, I volunteered to continue to keep up the flower beds again this year. I was planning to pick up some flowers early Sat. morning at plant at the church. If you want to meet me there around 8:30 AM or so that would be great (but please don't feel obligated). I think we could get the planting done in about an hour. Congrats to you on your recent wedding. I am so thrilled for you both. -----Original Message----- From: Chris.Sanguinetti@stpaul.com [mailto:Chris.Sanguinetti@stpaul.com] Sent: Tuesday, March 19, 2002 7:15 AM To: scorman@enron.com Cc: jimk@pdq.net Subject: AUMC Hello Shelly, Jim Keesling advised you were going to replant the flower bed by the Sanctuary entrance. I mulched it last week and was going to do something this week or Saturday latest. Please let me know if you need help in any way.
