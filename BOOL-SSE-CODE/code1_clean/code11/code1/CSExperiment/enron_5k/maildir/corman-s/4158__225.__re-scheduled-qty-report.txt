Subject: RE: Scheduled Qty Report
Talked with Metropolitan Utility District and NGTS today regarding Scheduled Quantities by Location & Path Report. Both are upset that format has changed and no longer MTD scheduled volumes showing. They both sent me copies of former reports and showed me what they liked about them. Talked to John Buchanan regarding this and he informed me to have them call our help desk to log situation.
