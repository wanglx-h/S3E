Subject: [Footballguys] BREAKING NEWS - Olandis Gary To Start?
For any of you with early lineup deadlines: ESPNews is reporting that Olandis Gary could get the starting nod at RB for Denver. [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ OUR VIEW ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] Welcome to Shannyland... Terrell Davis caught 5 passes last week and this could be an area where Mike Shanahan wants to use Gary. It's logical that both could see time until Terrell Davis is ready. Or I wouldn't be surprised to see Anderson get all the carries. Sadly, I wouldn't be surprised to see Gary get all the carries. It's a murky deal there right now. Unless it clears up pretty fast, I'd probably avoid. Joe /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Bryant Analytics, Inc.
