Subject: Data Request for Bulk Power Investigation
Mary: ? Attached is a copy of the data request for FERC's Bulk Power Investigation.? Please consider this e-mail as our official data request. ? As far as the deadline, we'd like to have the information as soon as possible but we realize that doesn't give you much time.? As I mentioned, some of the information probably won't require much effort, but we are asking for?specifics on generators which may take longer.? Just do the best you can.? Also, if you find that you have the information in a different format from the way we've requested it, that will probably be fine for our purposes. ? Please feel free to call if you have any questions. ? Thanks. ? Michelle Veloso 202/208-2008 - generators&marketers.wpd
