Subject: Mark Report....AGA Update
Since there will be no Mark Report today (due to the fact I need to catch a plane), The AGA number today was an injection of 15 BCF, with a revision from last week of +10 BCF to bring the total storage to 3.132 TCF or 484 BCF above last year and 313 BCF above the 5 yr average. Have a great Thanksgiving! See ya Monday! Mark D. Smith Manager Enron North America 713-853-6601 Mark.Smith@enron.com
