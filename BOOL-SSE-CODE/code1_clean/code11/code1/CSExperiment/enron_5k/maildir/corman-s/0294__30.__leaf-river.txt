Subject: Leaf River
George, I spoke with Fran about the Leaf River contracts. She indicated that we are waiting for details (names, etc) from Eric Connor. Once we get those, we can generate a draft for review and comment. I understand that Fran has asked Eric for this data. Let me know if you have any questions. Michelle
