Subject: CAISO Liaison
Hi Mary, I have left voice mails with both Debi LeVine (Director of Contracts) and Roger Smith (Senior Regulatory Counsel) of the CAISO. Roger's no. is 916-608-7135. I reached Debi through the operator at 916-608-7100. If I hear back, I will briefly describe our mission re: the RTO West tariff integration group, try to get a contact that we can work with, and then either refer them to you or try a 3-way call if they are interested in following up right then.
