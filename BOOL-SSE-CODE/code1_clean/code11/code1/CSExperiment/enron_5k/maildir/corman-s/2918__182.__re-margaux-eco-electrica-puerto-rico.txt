Subject: Re: MARGAUX - ECO-ELECTRICA, PUERTO RICO
Mark, Unfortunately, I do not know anything about EcoElectrica. I contacted Michelle Blaine at the former EI (thinking that there was some confusion between Blaine and Cash). Her assistant contacted me and said that, apparently, Coralina Rivera at the former EI has information about Eco Electrica in Puerto Rico. I have left Coralina a message indicating that you are looking for information about EcoElectrica and requesting that she contact you directly. Let me know if I can do anything further on this matter.

We would like a copy in the UK so we may ask your Houston office to do the honours and copy their set over to us. Thanks. Mark
