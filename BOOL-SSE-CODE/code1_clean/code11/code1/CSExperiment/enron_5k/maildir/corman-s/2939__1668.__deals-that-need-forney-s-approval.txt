Subject: Deals that need Forney's approval.
Please get a hold of John sometime today to get these deals approved. Leaf did a cut wrong and I had to change them after the approval deadline. These deal with a cut from the 21st. The deals that need to be approved are Enpower#'s 464394,464390 and 466378. Thank you for your help. Holden
