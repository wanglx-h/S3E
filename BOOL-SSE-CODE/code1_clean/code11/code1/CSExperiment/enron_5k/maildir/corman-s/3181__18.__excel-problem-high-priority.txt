Subject: excel problem, high priority
I somehow created 2 of the same file that it linked together. The 2 new files are xxx4:1 and xxx4:2. I dont know how I created this, but I have tried closing the file, exiting excel, but when I re-open the file, both of them open. This is a very important file so I need help as soon as possible. Thank you. Bob Badeer 503 464 3926
