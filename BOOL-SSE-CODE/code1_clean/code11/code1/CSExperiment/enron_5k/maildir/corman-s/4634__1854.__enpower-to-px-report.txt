Subject: ENPOWER TO PX REPORT
Group- There is a new "FIX" for the Enpower to PX Report. Due to the latest version of the trade app, the templates that we export and upload into CAPS need to be modified prior to uploading. The templates now contain ";;" when they need to have ";0;". So the temporary fix is to go into the template and manually enter the 0's where they are missing. The procedure should be as follows: 1. export th file to A:\\ as usual 2. save the file to O:\\ Portland\WestDesk\California Scheduling\PX Final Schedules\Final Schedules as usual 3. Open the file from the O:\\ drive and locate all consecutive semi-colons. There should be a zero between them. The easiest way to do this is the replace function. In the search menu, select "replace". In the "find what:" boxe, place ;; and in the "replace with:" box type ;0; Then choose "Replace all" two times. Save the file and you're done. 4. Upload the file into CAPS as usual. This should prevent the problems we have been having with the upload and keep Brett happy. Pete Davis is aware of the problem and we shouldn't have to do this for long.... Thanks guys. Jesse
