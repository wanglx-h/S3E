Subject: 2001 Enron MS Walk and Roll
2001 Enron MS Walk and Roll Saturday, April 21, 9:00 am Enron is the proud sponsor of this year,s Multiple Sclerosis Walk in Oregon. As a first time sponsor for this event, Enron will receive tremendous exposure in our community. We would like to encourage all employees to participate in this event to be held on Saturday, April 21, 9:00 am. Dollars raised by this Walk fund local health-related and educational services as well as help support national research efforts to find the cause and cure for this disease. Each employee should have received a &Be A Lifesaver8 notice about this event with the MS Society Walk brochure attached. Portland employees of Enron Broadband Services and Enron North America have partnered to form TEAM ENRON. Our goal is to have one of the largest teams in Portland - we want over 200 TEAM ENRON members! Our team is not just limited to Enron employees. We encourage all employees, contractors, vendors, family members (including children) and friends. This will be a fun gathering for TEAM ENRON and offers entertainment, food and activities for children. If you are interested in participating, please provide your REGISTRATION form (on the pamphlet or paper you received) to Jessica Burry or Anna Mehrer. We want to start counting up the number of TEAM ENRON members in order to keep everyone posted on our progress. A Kick-Off meeting for all Portland employees will be held in early March. Incentive prizes are awarded through the MS Walk; Enron will also be awarding some great incentives to TEAM ENRON members. Stay tuned for more details. If you have any questions or you need extra REGISTRATION forms, pledge cards, etc., contact Jessica Burry (503-464-3800) or Anna Mehrer (503-464-3834).
