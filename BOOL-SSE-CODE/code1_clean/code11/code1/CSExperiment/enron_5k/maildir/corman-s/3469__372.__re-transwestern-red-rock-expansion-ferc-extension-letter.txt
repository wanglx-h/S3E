Subject: RE: Transwestern Red Rock Expansion- FERC Extension Letter
One clarification, we have not executed contracts for 120,000, only 106,500 I think- otherwise ok. MK -----Original Message----- From: Rapp, Bill Sent: Monday, November 19, 2001 4:50 PM To: Harris, Steven; Watson, Kimberly; Lindberg, Lorraine; Miller, Mary Kay; Kilmer III, Robert; Lokey, Teb; Veatch, Stephen; Martens, Donna; Petersen, Keith Cc: Porter, Gregory J.; Pryor, Tony; Dornan, Dari Subject: Transwestern Red Rock Expansion- FERC Extension Letter Attached is a revised, red-lined version of the extension letter. I believe that I addressed Keith's question to his satisfaction, so I haven't added the additional language that he suggested regarding the timing of the removal of the existing compressor units at Stations 1, 2 and 3. Please let me know if you have any additional comments. Thanks. << File: TWFERCExtensionA.doc >>
