Envision Close Calendar Journal Vouchers and Flash Review Accounting Course 2: 1-1/2 hrs. SAP/Business Objects A/R Reconciliation & Collection/Late Pay Charges Imbalance Cashout Invoices & Calculations/OBA Imbalances Accounting Course 3: 1-1/2 - 2 hrs. GVA/TAS Rolling Priorities DDVC/SOL/SUL/SMS Pathing/Out of Balance Accounting Course 1 covers the accounting basics everyone uses, and covers the entire pipe. This is the lowest level of difficulty. Accounting Course 2 encompasses SAP, report retrieval, A/R reconciliation and imbalances, these skills are used on a daily basis. This is a more intermediate level course. Accounting Course 3 is more advanced accounting training, covering the accounting systems GVA and TAS, and the more complex reports for variances and pathing. DDVC's and rolling priorities are more specific to the north end of the pipe. Renee Perry J
