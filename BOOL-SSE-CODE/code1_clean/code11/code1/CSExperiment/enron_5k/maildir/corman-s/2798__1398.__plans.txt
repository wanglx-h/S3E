hey mark, how about them beavs!!! I suppose that surpassed even your expectations. It was definitely fun to watch them wax ND. Karen and I spent New Years in Palm Desert with a few friends that have a home right on the golf course. I played a round, but did not shoot as well as I did when I played with you. Shot a 104..... but was still pleased and had fun. As I told you last week, I will be going to Seattle for business and will be staying with Jorge on Saturday and Sunday nights. I arrive at Seatac at 1pm on Saturday. Just wondering if you decided to drive up for the weekend also. Let me know either way. If not, then we'll catch you in a couple months. love ya, dave ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ----------------------- The information transmitted is intended only for the person or entity to which it is addressed and may contain confidential and/or privileged material.
