Subject: RE: Outstanding Reservation Invoice
Okay - so I see that it's Orlando Cogen (not Orange). I'm unclear what the relationship is with El Paso. Do they own 100% of Orlando Cogen? Are they the designee? Have they sent correspondence to us that El Paso is now owner or contact party for this contract? -----Original Message----- From: Nacey, Sheila Sent: Thursday, February 14, 2002 5:33 PM To: Dowden Jr., Jimmy Cc: Collins, Marion; Corman, Shelley; Hayes, Robert Subject: Outstanding Reservation Invoice Jimmy, we could use a helping hand in collecting about $518 K from Orlando Cogen for their January reservation billing. Marion has called them on several occasions this week and they simply are not responding to her messages. We have several small customers we're still chasing, but Orlando is the most significant outstanding issue we have left. Could you give me a call in the morning so we can discuss. Thks! Sheila
