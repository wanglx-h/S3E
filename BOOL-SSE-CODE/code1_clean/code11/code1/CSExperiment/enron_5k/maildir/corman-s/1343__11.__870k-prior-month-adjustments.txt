Subject: -$870K prior month adjustments
Sean and Diana: Just wanna give you a heads up. From Settlements we learned that there will be -$870,820.56 prior month adjustments in your book due to BPA and Modesto related deals . I have researched on all the items and believe they are valid. Please take a look and let me know if you have any questions or concerns. If you don't disagree you shall expect to see this hit in your P&L for 8/31/01. Please also note that there might be other items to come between now and the end of this month. I will let you know when that happens. Thanks, Fran x7973
