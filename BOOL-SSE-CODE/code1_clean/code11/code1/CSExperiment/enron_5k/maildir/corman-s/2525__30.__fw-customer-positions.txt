Subject: FW: customer positions
Jay has been pulling reports over the last couple of days and so far so good. Reported attached if you need it. -----Original Message----- From: Webb, Jay Sent: Thursday, October 25, 2001 11:30 AM To: Kitchen, Louise; Zipper, Andy Subject: customer positions The enclosed spreadsheet shows the net online position by product, by counterparty, for a number of liquid gas products. Each column represents the life-to-date position generated on that product, for that customer, through the date in the heading of the column. I don't see an immediate indication of these customer closing out of positions. If I can put this into a more convenient form, let me know what would help. Thanks! -jay
