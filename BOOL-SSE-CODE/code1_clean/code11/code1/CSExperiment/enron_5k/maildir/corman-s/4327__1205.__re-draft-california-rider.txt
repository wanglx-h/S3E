Is there anything we can do to address circumstances where we are required to bid into the ISO pursuant to the DOE's Section 202(c) order - especially for the fixed price customers?

Customers selling for a fixed price would not be subject to these prior adjustments because the customers have no expectation that EPMI will necessarily sell into California.
