Subject: FW: TE Request for TABS-2 Assistance
fyi. -----Original Message----- From: Boudreaux, Shanna Sent: Monday, November 26, 2001 7:37 AM To: Townsend, Judy; Neal, Scott; Versen, Victoria; Lamadrid, Victor; Ordway, Chris; Pritchard, Michael Subject: FW: TE Request for TABS-2 Assistance FYI -----Original Message----- From: infopost@duke-energy.com [mailto:infopost@duke-energy.com] Sent: Sunday, November 25, 2001 12:00 AM To: infopost@duke-energy.com Subject: TE Request for TABS-2 Assistance November 25, 2001 Due to continued unseasonably mild weather and shippers filling contract storage inventories in anticipation of the coming winter heating season, Texas Eastern has virtually no storage capacity or linepack available for system operational purposes and cannot continue to absorb imbalances left on the system. Pursuant to Section 3.3 of Rate Schedule TABS-2, Texas Eastern offers to permit TABS-2 Parties to decrease physical receipts of gas into the system by an aggregate quantity of 300,000 Dth/d. Any decreases in gas receipts pursuant to Rate Schedule TABS-2 will not reduce such TABS-2 Parties? scheduled deliveries, whether at a TABS-1 Service Point or city- gate markets. This request for decreased receipts under TABS-2 is applicable for the STX, ETX, WLA, and ELA TABS-2 Service Points. All requests for decreased receipts under Rate Schedule TABS-2 will be accepted on a first-come, first-served basis. After Texas Eastern?s operational need for decreased receipts has passed, Texas Eastern will notify all participating TABS-2 Parties and such parties will have a reasonable time to come back into balance. Any TABS-2 party willing to decrease physical receipts into the system should contact their Account Manager. ******************************************************************* NOTE: Duke Energy Gas Transmission respects your online time and privacy.
