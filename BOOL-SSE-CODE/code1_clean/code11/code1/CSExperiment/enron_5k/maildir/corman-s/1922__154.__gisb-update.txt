Subject: GISB Update
Due to the additional activity within ETS and the holidays, we will not hold a GISB Update meeting during the remainder of this year. Hopefully we'll get back on a schedule after the first of the year. Below is my update on a few GISB matters. We'll go into more detail at our next meeting. ENERGY INDUSTRY STANDARDS BOARD (EISB) The GISB Board of Directors has approved revisions to GISB's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws to incorporate language necessary to transition to the new organization, which will address standards for wholesale and retail gas and electric transactions. The new organization, which goes into effect January 1, 2002, will be named the North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB). The wholesale gas quadrant, which is now GISB, should continue with business as usual. In January, I'll give a more detailed update on the workings of NAESB. GISB REPRESENTATON Stan Horton's term on the GISB Board of Directors expires December 31, 2001. Shelley Corman will take his place on the Board. Her term expires December 31, 2003. My term as a representative on GISB's Executive Committee expires December 31, 2003. ORDER 637 TRANSACTIONAL REPORTING The development of the new transactional reporting datasets for use on EBBs is almost complete. The EBB implementation should be included in the next publication, which is scheduled for July 31, 2002. This is probably a firm date. The EDI implementation is now a lower priority, but will still be developed. GISB VERSION 1.5 STANDARDS AND ERRATA Two separate errata have been developed for the version 1.5 standards. The errors in the standards books are extensive. The errata are posted alongside the books on the GISB homepage and have been distributed internally to all who received standards books. I am working to have GISB correct the standards books. Some people want to hold off and incorporate the corrections into the next version. Our implementation will be much smoother if we don't have to continually refer to the errata along with the standards books. I'll let you know what is decided. Thanks, Theresa
