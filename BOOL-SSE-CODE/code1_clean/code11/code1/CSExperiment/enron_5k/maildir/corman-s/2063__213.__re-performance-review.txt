Shelley, How about meeting Tuesday, Jan. 15 at 3:30 pm? I realize your schedule is subject to change and I will make myself available at your convenience if this doesn't work out. -----Original Message----- From: Corman, Shelley Sent: Thursday, January 10, 2002 4:30 PM To: Scott, Donna Subject: Performance Review Donna, Attached is the written comments that I prepared while I was traveling. I can't remember if I already sent this to you or not ...please forgive me if I already sent this to you (sinus congestion is not conducive to sound thinking). Let me know when you want to sit down and talk. << File: SCOTT DONNA L.doc >>
