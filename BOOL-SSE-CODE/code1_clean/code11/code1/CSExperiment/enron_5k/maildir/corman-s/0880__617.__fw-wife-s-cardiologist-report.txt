The Cardiologist says everything with Linda's heart is within normal limits. There are some criteria that are close to being out of the normal range, so he is going to run some other tests to create a baseline and is going to monitor her annually. The Cardiologist concurred with her primary care doctor that the anemia, along with the post-surgerical complications she experienced probably caused the heart palputations. Randy
