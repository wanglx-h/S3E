Subject: ff free agent points
Martin, ? I've calculated the total points everyone has earned over the course of the season based on where they finished each week.? For ties, i took total bench points to determine ranking - i think that's the way we do it. ? Assuming we all started with 100: Greg Martin????????? 158 Mark Friedman???? 152 Gary Lamphier???? 147 Scott Earnest?????? 144 Tony Harris????????? 143 Jeff Gossett???????? 142 Bill Kasemervisz? 141 Martin Cuilla??????? 139 Mike Morris???????? 138 Gary Taylor???????? 136 ? Of course, this doesn't take into account the points we've bid on for players we've picked up during the year. ? Gary
