Subject: DRAFT PRESS RELEASE: Cinergy's Purchase of Two Peaker Plants
Attached is the draft press release for Cinergy's purchase of the Brownsville and Caledonia peakers. They are routing it to their Treasury department for final review with respect to the opinion of their ratings agency. If everyone at Cinergy signs off, they plan to release this morning. They will call me prior to release. If you have any changes, please contact me ASAP. Thanks. Eric
