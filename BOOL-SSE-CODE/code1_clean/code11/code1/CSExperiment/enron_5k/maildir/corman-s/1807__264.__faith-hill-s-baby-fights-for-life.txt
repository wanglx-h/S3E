The suit seeks $10 million in damages, and claims that Green has been keeping artists from performing on both shows for years. Clark also claims that there is a "long list" of stars who are prohibited from appearing on the American Music Awards, produced by Dick Clark Productions Inc., one of which is self-proclaimed King of Pop Michael Jackson. In the lawsuit, Clark claims that Greene is the reason that Jackson will not appear on the AMAs, where he was supposed to receive the "artist of the century" award. According to reports, an Academy spokesperson could not confirm nor deny that Jackson will appear on the Grammys, saying, "Until we announce our nominees, we don't announce or confirm who's going to be on the show."
