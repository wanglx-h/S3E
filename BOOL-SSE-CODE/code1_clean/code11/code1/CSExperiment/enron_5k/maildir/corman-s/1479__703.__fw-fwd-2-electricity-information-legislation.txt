However, if there are additional changes you think should be made, we can still incorporate them in a separate bill Senator Wyden intends to introduce in the near future. ____________________Forward Header_____________________ Subject: information system Author: Sam Fowler Date: 03/19/2001 8:14 AM I incorporated the comments I got back from FERC last week, as well as the ones you forwarded to me, and put the revised version in the Democratic energy bill. - joshua- info system2.wpd
