Subject: Transmission prices
Dear Traders, I have been finding and fixing a great number of transmission deals lately and I have noticed the following that keeps coming up: When you put in a deal, please include the wheel if you are using transmission and be sure to route it properly. When you schedule transmission for a deal, please be sure to separate light load hours and heavy load hours and put them in at different prices. (except Sundays and holidays, which are for the most part at LLH prices all day). Please also record OASIS numbers in your Deal Entry or in Deal Scheduling when you request tranny. Both Deal Entry and Deal Scheduling have fields for OASIS numbers. If you don't provide OASIS numbers, I may have to rely on the counterparty's documentation as proof of # of MW requested. Here's a cheat sheet of LLH and HLH prices by company: BPA LLH $ 2.25 HLH $ 5.00 NPC LLH $ 2.40 HLH $ 3.60 SNO LLH $ 1.75 HLH $ 2.25 PAC LLH $ 5.84 HLH $ 5.84 Of course, there are stipulations and these prices are not set in stone. Please use your experience and discretion when entering transmission prices. Thanks guys, Virginia
