Subject: LV Cogen QF agreement.
LV Cogen (LVC) is a 50 MW PURPA Qualifying Facility (QF) located in North Las Vegas that has a long term QF power sale agreement with Nevada Power Company (NPC). LVC,s sale to Nevada is 45 MW HE 11-22 May-Sept and changes to HE 6-10 and 17-22 October through April. EPMI has agreed to market the excess output during the QF sale hours (4-5 MW) as well as the output during hours when there is no QF sale (49-50 MW). EPMI will generally purchase transmission from NPC from the plant to Mead and sell the power to the Px or ISO at Mead (LC1). There are occasions where Mead congestion has resulted in EPMI purchasing additional wheels from Mead to Palo Verde (from APS) to get the power into the CAISO. Peak hour production is 50Mw. Total daily output 1200 Mw. (50X24hrs) Let me know if there are additional questions. Les
