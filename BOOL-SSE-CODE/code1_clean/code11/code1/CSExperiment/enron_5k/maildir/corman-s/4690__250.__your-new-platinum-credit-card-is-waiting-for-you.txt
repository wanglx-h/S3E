[IMAGE] Your inspirational quote for the day: [IMAGE] Families [IMAGE] Families are chosen by our Father above given to us in this life to love. If things don't go well with friends that we choose. Our friendship we know we could always lose. But do we give our family the same respect? I think not, no wonder they get so upset. Our families are precious in life, they're the best part. So don't do and say things that upset the cart. [IMAGE] If you've said or done something that's got them upset. Tell them you're sorry put the bad feelings to rest. If they have upset you tell them how you feel. Don't let it grow and become a big deal. Remember the Lord chose them for a reason. He chose them for life, not just a season.
