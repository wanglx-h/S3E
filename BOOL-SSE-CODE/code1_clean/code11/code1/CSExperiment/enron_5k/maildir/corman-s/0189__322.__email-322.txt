Thank you for coming to floor meeting and for providing leadership. Couple of questions: ? Recognizing Dynegy doesn't have Corp RAC function, and that 100 million overnight risk is not something you want to land at business unit, do you think Watson will support Corp function? ? What can I do to help out? Frank
