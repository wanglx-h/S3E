Lynn, FYI, Kim. -----Original Message----- From: Hyatt, Kevin Sent: Wednesday, October 10, 2001 9:54 AM To: Moseley, Debbie; Watson, Kimberly; Cherry, Paul Cc: Gadd, Eric; Harris, Steven Subject: Oasis Dairy Farms Judgement Earlier this year I requested that the Enron litigation unit file suit against Oasis Dairy for collection of unpaid transport bills on TW. The suit was filed in the fifth judicial district court in Chaves County, NM. On October 1, 2001, TW was granted summary judgement in the case by the court in the amount of $29,250.56 inclusive of back interest and attorney fees. This amount will continue to accrue interest at 8.75% per annum until paid by Oasis. If you would like a copy of the judgement, please let me know. kh
