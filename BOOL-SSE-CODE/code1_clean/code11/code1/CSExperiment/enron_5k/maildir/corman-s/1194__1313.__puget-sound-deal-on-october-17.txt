Subject: Puget Sound Deal on October 17
Guys, Puget is claiming that we did a real-time deal with their trader, Lisa, on October 17 HE 20. The terms are 20MW purchased from Puget at a rate of $115. We cannot find anything in the Inc or Services sheet, and nothing is in EnPower. Please look in your trade books for this deal to confirm. I will get more information from Puget if I can, but so far, that's all I know. Thanks, Caroline PS Please respond to Virginia on this, whether you did the deal or not.
