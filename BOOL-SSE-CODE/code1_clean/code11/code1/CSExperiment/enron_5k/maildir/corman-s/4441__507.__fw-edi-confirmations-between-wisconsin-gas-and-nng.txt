The first EDI file should come in for the July 12 Timely Cycle. Wisconsin Gas will send NNG the confirmation and NNG will respond with the confirmation response and, if applicable, an unsolicited response on line items NNG has that Wisconsin Gas did not send. Wisconsin Gas will not be sending a confirmation response quick response. This confirmation process will be similar to WEPCO's confirmation process. Thanks, Mary
