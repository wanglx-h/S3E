Subject: FW: Request for Migration of Sitara EOLBridge into Production
All, A fix to prevent the occurrence of deals not bridging to Sitara from EOL when deal start and end dates were not entered on EOL has been installed and tested.THANKS -----Original Message----- From: Truong, Dat Sent: Thursday, October 25, 2001 5:22 PM To: Wei, Zhiyong Cc: Husain, Karima; Lim, Francis S.; Saluja, Gurdip; Sweitzer, Tara; Truong, Dat; Moorer, Torrey; Lamadrid, Victor; Severson, Russ; Grant, George Subject: Request for Migration of Sitara EOLBridge into Production Hello Zhiyong, I have implemented an enhancement to avoid the problem of restarting the Sitara EOLBridge when there are missing startdate and enddate. This fix will take care of this morning's problem. EOL will be sent a Failed status similar to the following: message={EolTransactionId=2101638 TransactionSysDealId="" BridgeEntityName="EOLBridge" Message="Missing StartDate or EndDate" Status="F" BridgeDate="20011025170945CDT"} I throughly tested the change by sending over 400 sample deals from this morning. Due to the "Bid Week" window, please approve this bridge enhancement for tonight's migration. Thank you. -Dat Truong x63015 -----Original Message----- From: Truong, Dat Sent: Thursday, October 25, 2001 11:11 AM To: Moorer, Torrey; Lamadrid, Victor; Severson, Russ; Grant, George Cc: Husain, Karima; Lim, Francis S.; Saluja, Gurdip; Sweitzer, Tara Subject: Sitara EOL Bridge Problem Today The problem we faced today was due to 2 eol deal packets (2098073, 2099764) not having startdate and enddate. Missing these 2 tibco message fields caused the bridge to bounce and resulted in the queue to build up while the bridge is starting up. (The bridge takes 2 minute for startup). Each time these deals are sent/resent, it continuously cause the Sitarar EOLBridge to restart, thus magnifying the buildup of the queue. The corrective action we are taking at our end is to build a rejection logic when eol packets do not have start and/or enddate. -Dat Truong
