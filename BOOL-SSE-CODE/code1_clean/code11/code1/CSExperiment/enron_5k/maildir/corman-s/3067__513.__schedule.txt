Ricki - would you please: 1. Make reservations at 11:45 on Thurs for Judy Johnson & I at Duck & Co in Hyatt 2. Set up a pre-meeting for Don Hawkins & I before our meeting with Rod tomorrow 3. Move my Wed. staff meeting to run from 10-11:30 (instead of 9-10). Since we no longer have a Wash office, I plan to watch the Commission meeting myself
