Michelle, Jay Epstein from the EIM Pulp & Paper Group tells me that certain Garden State Paper employees are providing technical support services on sales calls for newsprint. He asks whether they can be given Enron name cards in addition to GSP name cards. It is possible that these individuals will be supporting Crane sales as well. I told him I needed to check with you in light of your concerns regarding co-employer liability. I guess this issue also raises questions regarding whether we are opening the door to claims by these GSP employees that they are entitled to Enron benefits. Thoughts?
