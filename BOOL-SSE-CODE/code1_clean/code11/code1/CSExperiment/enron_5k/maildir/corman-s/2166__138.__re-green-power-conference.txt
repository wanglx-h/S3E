Subject: Re: Green Power Conference
Well, I know you are interested in green/renewable energy programs and issues because you were at the conference in Portland. So am I. It seems that renewable energy is on the brink of reaching a "tipping point," or critical mass in its move into the mass culture (and utility strategic planning). That is exciting and gratifying for the many people who have been working hard to make this happen. Although acquiring and increasing your supply of renewable power is still a challenge, the bigger, more pressing challenge, in our estimation, is selling it - how, who, where, when and for how much. So how far along are you, in getting your customers to think about, and buy green power? Need some help? We at Energy Market Solutions have been asking residential and business customers of utilities about green, renewable, and environmental issues for almost 5 years. We can help you understand the dynamics of the customer perspective on these issues, including positioning and pricing a green program for success, communicating effective green messages, and the effects of green programs on your image and brand. Call or email me to discuss how we can work with you on this exciting journey.
