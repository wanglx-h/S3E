From: "Laxmi Mrig" <lmrig@qwest.net> 03/28/2001 06:47 AM To: "Undisclosed-Recipient" <> cc: Subject: "What To Expect In Western Power Markets This Summer" Conference and Other Upcoming Events Dear Electric Power Industry Colleague: Soaring natural gas prices, heat waves, plant outages, low hydropower availability, capacity shortages ) many unexpected factors combined to send Western power prices upward last summer. In addition to fundamental factors, flaws in market rules and market power are also considered by many observers to have been significant causes. Western power markets continued to hold surprises in the fall and winter, as lower load levels did not result in the expected moderation of prices. Unprecedented gas market price spikes, and a credit crisis due to the near-bankruptcy of California utilities, were added to the complex mix of market drivers. Electric Utility Consultants, Inc. (EUCI) is organizing a conference to address these complex issues ) "What to Expect in Western Power Markets This Summer." The conference will bring together market forecasters, system operators, regulators, monitors, buyers, sellers and other industry experts to present and discuss the latest facts, policies, and forecasts. Presentations and panel discussions will cover supply, demand and price forecasts; how the Western markets work when capacity is short; changes to ISO rules and regulatory policies; and FERC,s price mitigation measures. In addition, a session will cover longer term developments in the western markets. Attend EUCI,s timely conference, "What To Expect in Western Power Markets This Summer" to get as clear a picture as is likely to be available.
