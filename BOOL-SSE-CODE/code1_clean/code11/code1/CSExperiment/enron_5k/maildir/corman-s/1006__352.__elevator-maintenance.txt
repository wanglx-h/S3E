Subject: Elevator Maintenance
Randy, Yesterday, Sunday the 24th, one of the Gas Control Dispatchers was stuck in an elevator for approximately 5 hours. Apparently the alarm and the intercom were not functioning and she had no way of notifying anyone that she was stuck between the 39th floor and the plaza. After other dispatchers became concerned about her being missing and searched for her, it was 2 hours before they determined she was stuck in an elevator. It then took another 3 hours to repair the elevator and get her out. We were advised by one of the guards that the weekly test and inspection of the intercoms was not performed on Saturday, as scheduled. We also were led to believe that the level of maintenance and monitoring of the elevators has recently changed. As you know, the Gas Control Center on EB42 is a 7X24 operation. It goes without saying that this type of situation is unacceptable and that a post-mortem of the event is required to correct any maintenance or operating deficiencies that may exist. Please research the event and let us know the root cause of the elevator failure, the intercom failure, and any changes in maintenance and monitoring that may have contributed.
