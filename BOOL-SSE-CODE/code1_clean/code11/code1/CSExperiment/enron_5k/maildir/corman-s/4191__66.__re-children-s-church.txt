Subject: RE: Children's Church
We had 22 kids and 3 adult helpers. The kids were pretty wild. It wasn't one of our better days. Oh well! If it's okay with you, I'd like to take a week break next weekend. I need to be at an event downtown at 1 Pm and it would be nice not to rush. I will bring you the boom box and CDs with music suggestions. Would that be okay? Also, Stan is not available the third weekend in November so I have agreed to switch with him. He will teach Nov 11 (I will be there to help) and I will take Nov 18 (Kim promises that he will definitely be there). -----Original Message----- From: BLT12139@aol.com [mailto:BLT12139@aol.com] Sent: Monday, October 22, 2001 9:50 AM To: Corman, Shelley Subject: Children's Church Hi Shelley: I hope all went well on Sunday. One thing I forgot was to ask you or Elizabeth to take a count of children/adults attending Children's Church and get it to Jackie in the office. If you want to email the info to me, I will be happy to call Jackie. Take care, Barbara P.S. Will you be there next Sunday to handle music?
