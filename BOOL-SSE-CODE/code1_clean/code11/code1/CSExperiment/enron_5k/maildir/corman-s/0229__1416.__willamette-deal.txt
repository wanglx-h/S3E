Subject: Willamette deal
Les, on 12/24 I input the Willamette transaction as usual however I could not get the deal number 471943 (transmission piece we have been using) to extend to this day. Therefore in order to keep us flat I just created one transmission deal for 15MW HE 1-24 and used the normal pac transmission price. I am not sure if this is correct or how this should eactly be handled. I will be on break from the 24th thru the 30 so if you could fix the deal if that is not the correct way to do it, that would be greatly appreciated. Also if you could let me know what was done for future reference. Thanks, Merry x-mas and Happy New Year!
