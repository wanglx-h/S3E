Subject: Draft re Interactions with PGE
In response to PGE's request that we coordinate more on various regulatory and legislative proceedings and our conversation today, we have agreed as follows: Due to code of conduct concerns and tight deadlines for regulatory filings, it is typically difficult to coordinate in advance. However, provided there are no code of conduct concerns, we will attempt to provide to PGE finalized drafts in advance of filing. RTO negotiations are one area we can clearly coordinate because they do not involve code of conduct issues but instead involve broad policy issues. On litigation matters, if ENA legal and PGE want to coordinate, Richard Sanders should be responsible for the coordination.
