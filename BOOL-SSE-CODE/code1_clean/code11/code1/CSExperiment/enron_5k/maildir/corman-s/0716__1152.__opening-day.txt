Subject: opening day
mark fyi, opening day for the dodgers is Monday, April 2nd against Milwaukee. It's a 1:00 day game. The girls happen to have a four day weekend that week and they are coming down for Karen's shower on Saturday...... so, I was planning on booking tickets for us on that day. Let me know if you are interested and I will book you a ticket... or more if you want extra. Field box seats are $17 in the outfields, so I'll probably just book those instead of getting scalper tickets. dave ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ----------------------- The information transmitted is intended only for the person or entity to which it is addressed and may contain confidential and/or privileged material.
