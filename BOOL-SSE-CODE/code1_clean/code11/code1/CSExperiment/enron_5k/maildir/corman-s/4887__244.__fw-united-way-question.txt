Subject: FW: United Way Question
Diane, Cindy replied back to ask you to take my contribution out of the payroll system. And, that I should then call UW to bill me directly. Please call me if you have any questions.

For my 2002 UW contribution, I asked to have a lumpsum payroll deduction in Feb. (unsual bonus time). Now, I want to have UW just bill me instead. I can't seem to get back into the system to change this. ???? Shelley x37083
