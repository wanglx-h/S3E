Subject: Pacificorp Buy-Resales
Group, When doing a buy-resale with Pacificorp, we need to agree on the buy and the resale prices on the phone. These prices need to be recorded in your trade log. We also need to now check the prices nightly on buy-resales with Pacificorp when doing the SAR. We are having numerous discrepancies with Pacificorp because of problems with buy-resale deal entry. I have listened to several tapes where only the spread ($10 or $20 dollars) is mentioned. Let's be sure to establish these prices, do the confirms nightly, and make sure we can continue to work closely with this counterparty. On a separate note...please be sure to use two tags on any buy-resales. Thanks. Bill
