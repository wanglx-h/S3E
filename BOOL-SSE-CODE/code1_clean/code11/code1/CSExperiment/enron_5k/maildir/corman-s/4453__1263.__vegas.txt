Hey Mark, Sorry for not contacting you sooner regarding the Vegas trek. I had planned on heading to Los Angeles for that weekend to visit a buddy. He is now moving into a new house with his girlfriend this weekend and will be busy with that. Doesn't look like I will be heading to Vegas now either. I guess that I will spend the weekend helping Dahl try to get that scow of his pieced back together. What a project that has evolved into. I plan on watching the game at my bro's bar. Not quite Cesar's Palace or MGM, but it will have to do... Have a great time! I hope you make it back in one piece. You will have to give me some of the good details when you get back. Good luck, Patrick Mains pmains@n2h2.com 206.834.1781
