Subject: Reschedule - "Reserve Study" (22 Feb 08:30 AM CST)
Thursday is the correct day for this meeting. Gary Zahn will be moving to ETS Financial Accounting and Frank Carriere will be assuming the NNG Project/Property Accounting manager's position vacated by Gary's transfer. I would like for us to visit with you to gain a better understanding of the overall objective and direction of the NNG depreciation reserve study. Shelley if you are available we can meet in your office or I can get the Team Room on 42.
