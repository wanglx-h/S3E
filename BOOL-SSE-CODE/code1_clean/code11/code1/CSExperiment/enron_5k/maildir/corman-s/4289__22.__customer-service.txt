Jerry, I want to take this opportunity and thank you for the high level of customer service you provided to Alliant-WP&L today. I received an email from Kelly Schneider this morning letting me know how much they appreciated your help. By alerting them that their final cycle noms were off by one MMBtu, they were able to fix their noms to prevent the whole batch being invalidated. Thank you again!
