Subject: New BPA Account Numbers
I have set up the following BPA account numbers since we have been submitting dec bids at Malin the past few days: CISO to PUGET 882716 CISO to WWP 681713 CISO to SCL 882790 CISO to Tacoma 882791 I realize these counterparties can pick up at malin however, I thought it would be useful to have these accounts set up in case they are unable or unwilling to pick up at Malin. Also I have added an account number for Turlock to SCL. SCL has been willing to do Buy/Resales from their system to Malin recently and this should be useful given that Snohomish has recently been unwilling to do so. TURLOCK to SCL 790612 These numbers have all been added to the RT BPA Account #'s spreadsheet in P:/realtime. Thank you for your attention to this matter.
