Subject: [Footballguys] BREAKING NEWS - Terry Glenn Late Injury
Hi Folks, You guys that got fired up after Terry Glenn's outstanding performance (I'm one of you) last week need to keep an eye on this. Foxboro, MA (Sports Network) - Patriots wide receiver Terry Glenn injured his hamstring during a workout on Thursday, and may not suit up for Sunday's game against the Colts. Midway through the Patriots' afternoon session, Glenn came up hobbling after making a cut on a pass route. The extent of his injury is not known. Glenn also experienced soreness after the team's 29-26 overtime win over the Chargers last week. Yet, he may have aggravated the injury on Thursday, possibly resulting in a pull or tear. The six-year Ohio State product caught seven passes for 110 yards with a touchdown in his first game back since being suspended on August 3 for violating the league's substance abuse policy.
