Subject: Meeting
Shelley: Welcome back! I was wondering if you had 30 minutes today to discuss NNG's major customers from a strategic perspective. Stan has asked me (on a very confidential basis) to explore various "buy back" options for NNG, including raising a lot of money! I wanted to get your thoughts on certain customers' willingness to participate in an ownership interest in NNG. I did not want to meet with Dave and his team given the Dynegy transition. I am free all morning except at 9 and this afternoon except from 2 to 4.
