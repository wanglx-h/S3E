Subject: EPE A/S Exercise
When El Paso gets exercised for replacement reserves by the CAISO and they play the 10 minute ramping games. Don't call EPE to ramp down their generation, if possible run an imbalance and receive the dec prices. I have cleared this with EPE and John Forney. If something happens to change this situation drop me a line. Paul
