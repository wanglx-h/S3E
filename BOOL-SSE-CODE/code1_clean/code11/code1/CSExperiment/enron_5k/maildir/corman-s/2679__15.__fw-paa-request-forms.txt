Subject: FW: PAA Request Forms
Shelley, I have three PAA's that the North team has done. Two people are IT. I wasn't sure if that made a difference? I told them I would see if we could get them done, but at this late date there were no guarantees. If you approve, I will have Fran fill out the necessary blanks. Thanks.
