Good afternoon, Mary. I work in the San Francisco Enron office and we have received some mail addressed to you. Both envelopes have the same return address of - Spiegel & McDiarmid, 1350 New York Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20005-4798. I tried to locate your address on People Finder, but didn't have much luck. If you could e-mail or call me with your location I could forward these on to you. Thanks! Jennifer Lind (415)782-7818
