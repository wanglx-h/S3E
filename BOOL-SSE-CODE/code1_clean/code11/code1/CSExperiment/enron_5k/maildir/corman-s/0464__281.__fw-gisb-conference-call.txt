Subject: FW: GISB Conference call
Maria, FYI. As for our draft language (ETS), we won't have that together until next week, and I will send it to you when it's ready. It may be a big help, though, to also listen in on the INGAA call. - Nancy -----Original Message----- From: Tangela Crump <TCrump@INGAA.org>@ENRON Sent: Wednesday, January 16, 2002 3:11 PM To: Bill Griffith (E-mail); Dale Davis (E-mail); Eugene Fava (E-mail); Iris G.
