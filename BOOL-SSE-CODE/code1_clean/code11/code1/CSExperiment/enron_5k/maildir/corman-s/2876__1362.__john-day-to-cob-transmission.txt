Subject: John Day to COB transmission
Group, Just a quick reminder of the process to pay back losses on our John Day to COB transmission. As you know we route the schedules through deal number 146517. At the end of the day, we need to aggregate the costs for losses on the transmission that is flowed and make an annuity to ST-NW. The annuity should be a purchase from ST-NW by Short Term West Hourly for 1 mw at the total cost for the losses for that day. Then put the annuity number in the inc sheet. Please try to standardize your annuity transactions going forward. Thanks Bill
