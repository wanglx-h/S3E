Subject: Re: Thanks for the Visit
I wanted to say I really enjoyed our visit as well. It has been a long time since I have set down and just visited with friends. Jane, thanks for taking the intiative to make this happen. I agree, we need to do this again. Tell Amanda, Seth and Kirby "hi" for me. Thanks.
