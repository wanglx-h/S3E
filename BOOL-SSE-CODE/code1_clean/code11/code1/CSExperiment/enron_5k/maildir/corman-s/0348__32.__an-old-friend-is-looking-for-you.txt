[IMAGE] Your inspirational quote for the day: [IMAGE] [IMAGE] [IMAGE] A Guardian Angel Flew down from above, To teach me a lesson About the powers of love. [IMAGE] She whispers to me, Takes a hold of my hand, There are so many things I wish you to understand. [IMAGE] About the powers of love, And all it can do, To someone who needs To share it with you. [IMAGE] A pat on the back, A kind smile on your face, Can make someone's life, A much brighter place. [IMAGE] It doesn't take much, To show someone you care, To give them the love, God gave you to share. [IMAGE] So please keep in mind, All the powers you possess, To grace someone's life, When they're in distress. [IMAGE] You've been put on this earth To bestow the powers of love, And with those final words, She disappeared up above.
