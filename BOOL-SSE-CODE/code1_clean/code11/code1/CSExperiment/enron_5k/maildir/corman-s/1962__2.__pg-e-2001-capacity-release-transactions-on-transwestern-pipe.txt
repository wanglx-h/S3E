Subject: PG&E 2001 Capacity Release Transactions on Transwestern Pipeline
FYI While I have been periodically giving updates on the above max rate capacity release activity, I was surprised by the magnitude of the PG&E value above max. rates. For the 12 months ended 9/30/01 we had net cash payments to PG&E. (approx $18 mil revenues to Cal. + $5.6 revenue on San Juan - $28 million in above max rate capacity release activity = ($4.4) million
