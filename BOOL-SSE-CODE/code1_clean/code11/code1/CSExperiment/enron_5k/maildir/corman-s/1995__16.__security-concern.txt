Subject: Security Concern
With heightened security concern in the building this morning, I wanted to report two items: 1. When I parked in the Allen Center Garage this morning, level 7 yellow section (at the top of the stairs from the Enron building, just under the covered area), I noticed a large brown/copper truck. I park my blue explorer in this same spot every day and I have never seen this truck before. It's probably nothing, just wanted to report it. 2. When I reached my desk this morning I wanted to call in this concern. I pulled up the corporate security number listed on the website 713-435-2804. The woman that answered the phone was rude and said that the number wasn't corporate security, but rather building security -- she laughed and didn't seem remotely interested in my concern. Perhaps, I misunderstood the website posting about who to call with security concerns. But, if I did, perhaps other employees will as well....
