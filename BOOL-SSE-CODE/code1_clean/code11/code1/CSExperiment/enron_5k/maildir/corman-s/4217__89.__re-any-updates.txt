I think you should be there, so it can wait until later in the week. Other priorities obviously govern. Thanks.

Here is the revised review (password - oberon). I have meetings scheduled for the afternoon and am not sure I will be able to get out of them at any particular time. Does it make sense to give her the review without me being there and meet later or not? << File: NELSON CHERYL - revised2 - clean.doc >> -----Original Message----- From: Mayes, Fran Sent: Monday, October 29, 2001 10:07 AM To: Taylor, Mark E (Legal); Cash, Michelle Subject: FW: any updates?

Yes, I spoke with Mark on last Thursday and the revisions are complete. He will let me know today when the three of us can meet to discuss.
