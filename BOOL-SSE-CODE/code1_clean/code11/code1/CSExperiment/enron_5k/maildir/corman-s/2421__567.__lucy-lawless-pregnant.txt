Well, it will be a happy Thanksgiving for fans of the show -- Pitt will appear on Thursday's episode. Pitt plays an old high school friend of Courteney Cox's character Monica. She invites him to share Thanksgiving dinner with her and the rest of the gang. But tensions flare when he sees Aniston's character, Rachel -- they were enemies in high school. In an interview, Pitt says he and Aniston have some "gangbuster" scenes together. He also reveals that he is a longtime fan of the show. "It's a happy show," said Pitt. "It comes on and it makes me happy. It's always been that way since its first incarnation, before I met my wife." Pitt also said that it had not been decided whether his character will return in future episodes, or if it will be a one time only appearance. Stay Tuned! [IMAGE] [IMAGE] LOSE 10 POUNDS BY DEC. 25th!
