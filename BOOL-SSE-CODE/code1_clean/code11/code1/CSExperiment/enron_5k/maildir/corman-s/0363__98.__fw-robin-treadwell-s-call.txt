Subject: FW: Robin Treadwell's Call
Robin, Diomedes was not eligible for severance because of outstanding expense reports -- approximately $400K. I know that Mary was involved in this to great detail. Once the expense report issue is clarified, then he would be eligible for regular severance. Mary and Tim Callahan have been coordinating those issues.

Diomedes believes "he met the milestones." Robin was told that you and Mary Joyce were working on this. Can you e-mail Robin Treadwell and give her an update? Thanks.
