Subject: a&k
Teresa Bushman called me with a questions that has been passed along from Dave Reynolds to Jim Derrick, to Mark Haedicke to Theresa . . . The gist of the question is whether we object to A&K representing 3 geophysicists in negotiations with Mariner on employment contracts. Because we're doing employment work for Mariner under a services agreement, that could (1) put A&K across the table from us in negotiations; and (2) pit A&K against us if we ever have a breach of contract issue or have to enforce a non-compete, etc. for those employees. Also, I don't know whether A&K has represented Enron on employment contracts, but if so, the firm may have confidential information related to how we approach such contracts (much of which likely wouldn't be different for Mariner's contracts), and I wouldn't want them negotiating from that base of knowledge. In addition, Theresa Bushman believes that Mariner may use A&K for some work in the future. All in all, I would say no on this. What do you think? --Lizzette
