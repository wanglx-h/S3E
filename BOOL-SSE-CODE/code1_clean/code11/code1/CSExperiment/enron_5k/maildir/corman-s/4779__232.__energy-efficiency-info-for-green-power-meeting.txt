Subject: Energy Efficiency info for Green Power meeting
Elliott, I apologize for sending this at the last minute, but wanted to see if you might be able to incorporate some information regarding the Energy Efficiency Credits Program Stacey and I have been working on in PA into your presentation for next week's Green Power meeting. I have attached the latest draft (there are some minor changes that are not reflected) of the program proposal which we hope to have approved by the Green-e Board in September, and three power point slides. I think we're made real headway in PA, and we hope to use this as a template for other states. Please call Stacey or me if you have any questions. Thanks, Heather 603-746-5352
