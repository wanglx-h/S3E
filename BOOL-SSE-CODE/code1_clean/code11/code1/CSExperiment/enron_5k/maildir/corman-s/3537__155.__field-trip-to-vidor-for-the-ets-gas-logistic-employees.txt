Subject: Field Trip to Vidor for the ETS Gas Logistic Employees
Virgil, I wanted to say "Thank You" for your time and effort given to our new employees as they toured your facilities in Vidor on Tuesday, September 25. I know it was the first time most of them had been to a compressor station and they found it very interesting. This was one step in our efforts to help them match the Physical world (Operations) with the Paper world (Nominations, invoices, etc). Please pass on my "Thanks" to the others that contributed to this educational process. Lynn Blair
