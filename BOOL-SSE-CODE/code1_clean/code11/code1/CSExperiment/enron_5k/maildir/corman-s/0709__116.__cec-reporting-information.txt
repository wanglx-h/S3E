Subject: CEC Reporting Information
Richard attached is the CEC reporting infomation for Nov. 01. Once you have put the purchase information in would you please save the entire work sheets to J:consumer/reporting/power/volumes/reporting/GreenCEC under the applicable file word document. I am going to keep a Monthly folder of all of the CEC reporting. I have also set up an excel folder with the backup for the sales if you would like to view that before filing. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me at X5_3091 Pam
