Hi Nancy I have Alina at the Dr for her physical this afternoon, but we should be home by 6 PM and be home all evening. Sorry I missed choir last night . We are still transitioning and Alina had a fit as we were leaving a friend's house to come to choir. See you soon Shelley -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net)
