Subject: Meeting Scheduled
The time is blocked for Michelle Lokay and Paul Y'Barbo, tomorrow from 2:00 until 3:00. I still need to let them know the subject. I will also need to schedule one-on-one's with all Marketing Directors when you give me the go-ahead. Have TK and Mike already had theirs? Thank you, Ricki
