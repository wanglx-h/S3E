Subject: Dinner, Wed. Nov. 7
Elliot and I just discussed trying to pull together a dinner in Portland on Wednesday, Nov. 7 (the night before our retreat starts) for our group and some individuals in the mid-market and services groups. He is going to contact these individuals on Monday. If possible, please try to arrive in Portland before dinner time that evening. There is a Continental flight that leaves around 11:45 and arrives in Portland around 2:15. Thanks!
