The move to production is planned to begin on Saturday, September 15th at 6:00 p.m. and should be complete around 3:00 a.m. on Sunday, September 16th. EDI files will continue to be processed until 11 p.m. At that time, there will be a total disruption of EDI service until Sunday morning at 3 a.m. Paging will still be in effect until 11 p.m. To verify that all EDI files have been processed Saturday evening, please page the EDI production support pager at 713.327.3893. The oncall person for the EDI Hub is Sanjay and he will have access to outstanding file information. Also, I can be paged at 800.506.0472. To access the new Team EDI system on Sunday morning, continue to use the links/addresses, logon IDs and passwords that you use today. The new system will look like the current system, but will have a couple of enhancements that will be discussed in a later memo. If you have any questions, please e-mail me or page me. Mary
