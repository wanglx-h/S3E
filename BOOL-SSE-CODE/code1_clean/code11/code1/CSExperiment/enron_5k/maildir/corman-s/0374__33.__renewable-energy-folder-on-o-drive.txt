Subject: Renewable Energy folder on O-drive
All - You should all now have access to a shared folder in the O drive. Together with the internal competitive analysis web site we are developing, we can use this to keep files we all need access to. Check it out - O:\StateGovAffairs\Renewables Let me know if you have any problems accessing this. Jenny
