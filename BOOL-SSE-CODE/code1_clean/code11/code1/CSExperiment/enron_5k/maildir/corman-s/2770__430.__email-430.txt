Um....yeah. U.S., Japan Pursuing Space-Based Solar Power Systems The National Space Development Agency of Japan, or NASDA, has announced plans to develop a satellite-based solar power system that would beam energy back to Earth. A satellite carrying large solar panels would use a laser to transmit the power to an airship at an altitude of about 12 miles, which would then transmit the power to Earth. NASDA currently expects to develop the laser technologies in the next 10 years and aims to conduct its first power transmission test in 2025. See the NASDA Web site at: <http://spaceboy.nasda.go.jp/note/kouso/E/kou106_solar_e.html>. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in the United States has been pursuing a similar approach, although with less ambitious goals. A September review of the NASA research by the National Research Council (NRC) found the research worthwhile, although it noted that the funding levels would have to be much higher to achieve its goals. The review noted that "dramatic reductions" would be needed in the cost of placing the system into Earth orbit and in the cost of the solar panels, and that significant progress is still needed in the technology to manage the power in space and beam it back to Earth. See the NRC report at: <http://www.nap.edu/books/0309075971/html/>. The subject of space-based power has also been examined by Resources for the Future (RFF), a Washington-based group that studies energy and environmental policy. A report issued last year suggested that space-based power would have difficulty competing with land-based power sources, and urged that economic analyses continue in tandem with the technology development. However, a more promising avenue was suggested in an October report, which examined the concept of using a space-based power plant to beam power to other space-based facilities. See the "Discussion Papers" in the Space section of the RFF Library at: <http://www.rff.org/nat_resources/space.htm>. If those concepts aren't far enough into outer space for you, consider this: wind energy might be a great energy option on Mars. It turns out that solar power systems, which are usually used for power in space, would be least effective during Martian sand storms, when it's windy, of course. So a wind and solar hybrid energy system might work best. Similar systems operating in Alaska and Antarctica may serve as models for these Martian power systems.
