Subject: RE: A draft Business Continuity Plan for a Short or No Notice
 Evacuation of the Enron Building
Good job on these. I think they will give Shelley comfort that a plan has been created. We will discuss these with her at her 11:00 update meeting this morning and determine the next steps (Tuesday meeting, drill date etc).

They are intended to be the front and back for 3 laminated cards. They provide the plan for responding to a very short notice or no notice evacuation of the Enron Building. The first card is for what I have called (we can rename the group) the BCP 1st Responders. This would include the BCP Directors and Coordinators, ETS Business and IT Team Leads, Mgrs, Dirs, VPs, and key staff, and ENW Contacts. The second card is for the OCC. The third card is for the remainder of the ETS BCP Team members, both Business and IT staff. Jean is touching up the OCC ETS BCP defined call burst groups and messages to match this process. Bob and I will be completing the Hangar Offsite layout, setup process, teams, and other documentation on Monday. We will get the documentation mounted and stored at the Hangar for use during an activation. We will also get the equipment stored at the Hangar. There is a meeting planned for Tuesday, at which we should be able to finalize the initial process, and schedule the first test. Get us your comments on the attachments. We tried to keep it short and simple, but with enough detail to avoid confusion during such an event. Thanks, Gary << File: ETS Gas Logistics BC Plan - 1stResp, OCC, & Team.doc >>
