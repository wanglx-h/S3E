Subject: W-2 Question
Rita, I was recently quizzing payroll on why I received two W-2s (which sum in aggregate to my 12/31/01 payroll stub) when I thought had been employed by the same co. (366) all year. Her records indicated that you had entered a change during the year. Could you look into why I can listed as having worked for both Enron Operations Services Co & Enron Corp. in 2001?
