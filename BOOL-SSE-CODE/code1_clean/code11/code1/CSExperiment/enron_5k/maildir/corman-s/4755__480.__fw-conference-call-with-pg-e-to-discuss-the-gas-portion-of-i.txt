 Proposed Plan of Reorganization that It Will File w/FERC Toward End of

I would recommend that we participate. In addition to myself we may want Steve V and/or Teb to also attend as they explain their FERC filing for making the backbone system jurisdictional. Let me know if you concur and then I'll advise Jeff.
