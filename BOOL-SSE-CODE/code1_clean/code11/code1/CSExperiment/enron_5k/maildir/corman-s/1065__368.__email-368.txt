Hi Michelle, The original fax I sent to you on Friday are the only names that John wanted the letters for. I misread the paper and did 4 extra people by mistake. EEEK! Anyway - I think he may want some revisions today, so please let me know if you are making any adjustments or changes to the documents from Friday! Thank you! Best Regards, Julie Clyatt (713) 853-3256
