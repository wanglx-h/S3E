I have interest in being wherever you are...i dont have any kids, but can i bring my cats? xo -----Original Message----- From: Mckay, Jonathan Sent: Wednesday, November 07, 2001 4:25 PM To: Lavorato, John; Tycholiz, Barry; Holst, Keith; Storey, Geoff; Arnold, John; Jenkins, Beth; Benson, Robert; Pimenov, Vladi; Mckay, Brad; Maggi, Mike; Griffith, John; Marquez, Jose; Roberts, Mike A.; Bennett, Stephen; Ames, Chuck; Neal, Scott Subject: Hello, I was just dropping this note to see if anyone was interested in getting together for the Rice Owls homecoming game against Tulsa this weekend. Game time is 2 pm and I thought we would get walk-up tickets (eveyman for himself). If people are interested we would have a little tailgate party prior to kick-off and watch the 6-3 Owls (undefeated at home) kill the Tulsa Hurricanes. Drop me a line if you have interest as I am trying to get critical mass. Jon PS. Please invite anyone that has interest in coming along and bring your kids if you have them.
