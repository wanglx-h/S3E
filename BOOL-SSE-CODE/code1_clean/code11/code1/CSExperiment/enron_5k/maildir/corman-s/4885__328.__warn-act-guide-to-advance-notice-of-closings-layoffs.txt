Subject: WARN Act Guide to Advance Notice of Closings & Layoffs
[IMAGE] [IMAGE] [IMAGE] [IMAGE] Sponsored by [IMAGE] WARN Act exceptions to 60-day notice are: (1) Faltering company. This exception, to be narrowly construed, covers situations where a company has sought new capital, or business in order to stay open and where giving notice would ruin the opportunity to get the new capital or business and applies only to plant closings; (2) Unforeseeable business circumstances. This exception applies to closings and layoffs that are caused by business circumstances that were not reasonably foreseeable at the time notice would otherwise have been required; and (3) Natural disaster. This applies where a closing or layoff is the direct result of a natural disaster, such as a flood, earthquake, drought or storm.
