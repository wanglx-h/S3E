Subject: OSHA Ergo Final Rule Clarification
The attachment below is the personal response from Charles Jeffress to NAM's request for clarification as to the compliance date for enforcement to commence for the OSHA final rule on Ergonomics. This credits the proposed Enron Grandfathering plan to have the remainder of the time to Oct. 15, 2001 in which to achieve full activation of the written plans within each of the Enron companies. While there are substantial numbers of law suits filed over this final rule, the outlook for any satisfactory court action is unlikely, as is action from Congress. Any repeal actions from a new OSHA administration would likely take longer than Oct. 15, 2001 to become effective. Russ
