FYI. This morning I talked to Karen Moore and explained that we were going to meet with Karen Denne to discuss the name of the department. I told her a little about the project and she offered to provide me her draft of a communication plan. She provided me with a draft plan this afternoon and I will review it over the weekend to develop message points for the communication plan.
