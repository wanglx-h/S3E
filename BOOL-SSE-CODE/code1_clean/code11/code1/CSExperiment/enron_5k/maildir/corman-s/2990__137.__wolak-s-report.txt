Subject: Wolak's report
Joe Attached find the report you requested. Alan - Governor Davis offered a highly discounted forward contract ($45-50/MWh) at the FERC settlement conference today. As usual, California is trying to get its refund with or without FERC requiring it. Alan - Tim and Joe will likely need your assistance with this settlement negotiation.
