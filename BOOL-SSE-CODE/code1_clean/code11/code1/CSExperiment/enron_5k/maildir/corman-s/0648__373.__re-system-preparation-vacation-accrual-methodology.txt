Subject: RE: System Preparation - Vacation accrual methodology
Given that this has not been communciated to current employees, I believe that we should consider whether we want to continue this strategy at this time. It strikes me as something that should be discussed at the management committee level, as that was the group that made this decision last summer.

Under the policy revision, vacation accruals will be 1/12th. of employees annual allotment, applied on the last day of each month, effective January 2002. Jo Ann Hill had assumed the lead in getting this issue addressed. She is not available to confirm preparations. Before we communicate this change to those employees covered by Enron's US domestic HR / SAP payroll policies, We should be certain the system is prepared. Please confirm that the system will not credit an annual allocation to employee vacation balance on January 1, 2002, and; Please confirm that the system will credit vacation time balances with 1/12 of the annual allocation on the last date of each month, beginning January 31, 2002 Thanks for your prompt attention to this matter, Regards, Rj. 3-9253 Cell - 713-898-6874
