Subject: SCR Meeting
JCharlton@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List: There is an ICWG Meeting scheduled for November 1 from 9AM-3PM. There is also a Demand Response WG Meeting planned for November 2. I would like to meet with any, or all, SCR RIPs to discuss the form and substance of SCR Certifications, Event Reporting, Metering requirements and expectations, Deficiencies and charges, derating methodology, UCAP, etc....ALL RIPs should participate, if possible. It seems possible to meet on the afternoon of October 31, before or after the ICWG meeting on November 1, or prior to the Demand Response WG meeting on November 2. Please advise of your availability.
