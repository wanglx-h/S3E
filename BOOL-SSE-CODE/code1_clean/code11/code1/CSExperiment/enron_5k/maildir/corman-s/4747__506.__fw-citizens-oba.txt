Terry, would you work with Darrell on this issue and let me know outcome? Thanks. Lynn -----Original Message----- From: Hanagriff, Richard Sent: Wednesday, July 11, 2001 3:17 PM To: Schoolcraft, Darrell; Mulligan, Amy Cc: Dietz, Rick Subject: citizens oba It appears that Citizens is continuing to overschedule volumes, thus the oba is still getting bigger. Even though this oba will probably be cashed out, should we allow them to continue to "overschedule"? They have also been in a penalty situation the past few months. When we do cash out, I think that we should deduct these penalties from their payment.
