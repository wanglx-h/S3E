Greetings Yes, it is that time of year again. Time to start thinking about another championship season. This is going to be real preliminary, what I need to know is who is interested in playing, then we can get into the gory details. Here though is a basic schedule - Register in mid-February. Season starts in May and we will play 5 games in 5 weeks. Then there is a two week break to make up games. 2nd half starts in July and again 5 games in 5 weeks. The cost is going to be around $50-70 depending on things. Games will be once a week starting anytime between 6:30 and 9:30 or something like that. So, let me know if you want to play or not. Chris
