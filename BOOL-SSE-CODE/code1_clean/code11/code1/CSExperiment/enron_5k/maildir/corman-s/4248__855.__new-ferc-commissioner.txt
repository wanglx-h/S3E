Subject: New FERC Commissioner
PUC Member Brownell Named to FERC A.P. INDEXES: TOP STORIES | NEWS | SPORTS | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | ENTERTAINMENT By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Filed at 5:52 p.m. ET WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Bush nominated Pennsylvania Public Utility Commissioner Nora Mead Brownell to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Tuesday. Brownell, a member of the state panel since 1997, would serve on the federal commission through 2006 if confirmed by the Senate. The five-member Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulates wholesale power markets and interstate natural gas pipelines. During her time on the state commission, Brownell helped oversee Pennsylvania's electricity deregulation, which has been praised as a national model. She has supported research into renewable sources of energy and was instrumental in having the commission create a $21 million fund to be used for investment in clean energy projects including wind, solar and biogas ventures. The 53-year-old native of Erie, Pa., previously served as executive director of the Regional Performing Arts Center in Philadelphia and was a senior vice president of Meridian Bancorp Inc. She attended Syracuse University.
