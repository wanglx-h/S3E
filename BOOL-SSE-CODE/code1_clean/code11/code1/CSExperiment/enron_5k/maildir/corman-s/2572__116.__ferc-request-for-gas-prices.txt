Subject: FERC request for gas prices
Bill Howard from FERC just called me. The Chairman of FERC is asking for the following information by the end of the day today: How much gas did we buy today by basin either: as of the beginning of the day or as of midnight? How much of the gas went into California? What was the average price or the high and low price? I asked him to if FERC wa asking other market participants. He said more and more every day and they would continue this until prices started going down. I asked him if the Commission intended to keep this information confidential. He said he didn't know. Christi - could you work with Phillip on this? Bill's number is (202) 208-1268.
