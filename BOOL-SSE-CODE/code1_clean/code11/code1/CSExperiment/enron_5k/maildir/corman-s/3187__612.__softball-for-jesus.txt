Subject: Softball for Jesus?
In my haste to schedule practices, I didnt realize that I had scheduled one on Easter Sunday. So, what I need to know is who is going to make it and who cant. That means that you will have to use the "Reply" function and give me a simple "yes" or "no". If you cant make it, dont worry, we still have two more practices scheduled - Sunday April 22nd at 1 PM and Saturday April 28th at 1 PM. All are at Westmoreland Park #2. Westmoreland Park is on SE 22nd and Bybee. If you need directions let me know. Call me at 503-296-0782 if you have any questions or comments. See ya. Chris
