Subject: The Singletary Family Adoption...
Thanks to everyone that helped us make the holidays brighter for the Singletary family. They received many wonderful gifts! To name a few, Gameboys, scooters, helmets, Pokemon toys, socks, underwear, pajamas, clothes, food, candles, shampoo and conditioner, lotions, makeup, etc., etc., etc. Jeffrey Oh and I delivered the gifts to our family last night. The kids were very excited and happy to see so many gifts. They were a big help to get all the gifts from the car to the house. The Mom was amazed at how much we had done. She kept saying, "I never expected so much!" She asked for our address so she can send a thank you note. Since she had recently separated from her husband and lost her job due to illnesses, she was having a very tough time this year. She asked us to thank you all. Thanks again to everyone for your generousity! Best wishes, and hope your holidays are as bright as theirs this year!
