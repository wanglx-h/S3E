Subject: Boston Globe Article
Peggy Mahoney asked me to forward this to you. FYI - Here is a link to the Boston Globe article I have discussed with most of you. After numerous conversations and plenty of information proving otherwise, the reporter unfortunately decided to do this article based upon recent happenings. It is clearly a cheap shot. On a happier note, here is a good article about our relationship with Quaker Oats in the Chicago Sun-Times. Thanks, Peggy
