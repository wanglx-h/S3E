Subject: H-town HO! HO! HO!!
Hey everybody!!! I know the holiday season gets a little crazy, but if you're not attending a company Christmas party, fighting the masses at the malls, or going to Cousin Timmy's dysfunctional family get-together, please leave Saturday night open for hall deckin' H-town style!! The plans for the entire evening have not been determined, but Zooey & Marty have graciously offered The Bellefontaine Pub as a starting place for all of us. Just think... We can sing & roast marshmallows there for a couple of hours, and then we'll hit the town with our holiday Nog breath!! Just another great excuse to get together & celebrate with friends! So.... Bring your favorite beverage, and come by for the munchies & fun around 7:00. Look forward to seeing you all!! Laura Lou Who
