Lynn -----Original Message----- From: Johanson, Tim Sent: Monday, October 29, 2001 2:04 PM To: Williams, John; Blair, Lynn; Floyd, Jodie; Bryan, Randy Cc: Stevens, Bob Subject: Requested training by Xcel in Denver Importance: High Hello, Xcel has requested that we provide an afternoon of training at their offices in Denver (similar to last year). The training would go from 12:00 PM - 4:30 PM on 11/15/01 and would cover any nomination/scheduling questions they have. Xcel has also asked to have someone there to specifically address capacity release and the final AM true-up process. Please let me know who you would recommend as representatives from NNG. I would like to get back to Xcel by this Thursday regarding our attendees. Tim Johanson
