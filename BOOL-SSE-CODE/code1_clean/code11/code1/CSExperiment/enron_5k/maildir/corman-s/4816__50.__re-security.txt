I am fine with Gary and Darrel having update access as long as they understand that it means they have access to change shippers info. Thanks.

Currently I have both Gary and Darrell set up with update capabilities to the process control and inquiry to all of the TMS screens. Let me know if you are OK with them having any kind of update capabilites and I will get a form together for your approval. Thanks, Maggie
