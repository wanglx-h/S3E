Subject: unsigned contracts
Based on my review of the files, we do not have signed agreements for the following: Tom Alonso* Mark Fischer* Ben Jacoby Laura Luce Mike McDonald Narsimha Misra Dave Parquet Gregg Penman Frank Vickers Andy Zipper Would you mind asking the vault if they have these? If not, could you get with Knudsen to get them? Thanks. (By the way, no one should know why). Thanks a lot!! Michelle
