Actually that doesnt sound very funny to me. I mean what the fuck did he do that for? What was he so mad about? I can imagine that you would be scared seeing him act like that. Hopefully he doesn't ever act like that or show that kind of temper around you. Anyway its really none of my business i guess. I appreciate the sentiment about my family and I will mention it to my mother. I hope you feel better.
