Subject: RE: Storage Allocation Request - REVISED
Chris, I have asked the IT group to see if they can recover the data and a search is underway. A number of the IT staff is on vacation due to the holidays.... so the answer may take some time...I let you know when I know more................ Happy Thanksgiving ! -----Original Message----- From: Sebesta, Chris Sent: Tuesday, November 20, 2001 4:24 PM To: Bodnar, Michael Subject: Storage Allocation Request - REVISED In a second conference call with Alliant, they requested Northern provide them with the storage injection allocations (on Intraday 2) that occurred from November, 1998 through April, 2001 (heating seasons only). I told them this info must be retrieved from archives. Let me know how long you think it will take to get this information. Thanks!
