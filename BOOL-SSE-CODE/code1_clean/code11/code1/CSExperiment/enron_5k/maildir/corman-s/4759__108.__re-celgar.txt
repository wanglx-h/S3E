My understanding is that the deal is dead -- stop the presses. Thanks for all of your help on this -- I appreciated your efforts and explanations. Perhaps we will work together again in the future.

Further to my voicemail, should we advise the actuaries to cease their due diligence work on the Celgar pension plans? They have just called me to advise about some further liabilities under the supplementary plan for non-union employees. Thanks.
