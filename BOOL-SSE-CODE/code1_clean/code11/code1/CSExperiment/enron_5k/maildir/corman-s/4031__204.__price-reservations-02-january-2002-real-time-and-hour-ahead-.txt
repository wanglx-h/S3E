Subject: Price Reservations 02 January 2002 Real-Time and Hour-Ahead Markets
 and 03 January  2002 Day-Ahead Market
The NYISO is reserving hour beginning 20:00 in the January 2, 2002 Real-Time Market to verify prices. Prices in the January 3, 2002 Day-Ahead Market are correct. Please note that Market Monitoring will no longer be reserving prices due to ECA-B. Code modifications were made on December 20th to automate the ECA-B price replacements. Current real-time prices reflect any necessary changes due to ECA-B.
