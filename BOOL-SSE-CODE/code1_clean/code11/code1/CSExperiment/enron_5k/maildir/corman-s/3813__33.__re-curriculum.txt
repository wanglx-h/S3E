Shelley - See when Patty is available, and I will attend if I can. All the dates you mentioned are possible but not certain for me, except for Sunday, which is bad for me. (We will not be in church this Sunday.) I am particularly interested in seeing what the Children's Church curriculum looks like... Thanks, Shelley! Barbara
