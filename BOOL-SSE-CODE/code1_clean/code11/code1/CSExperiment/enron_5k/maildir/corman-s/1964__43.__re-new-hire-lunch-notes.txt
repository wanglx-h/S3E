John, have we met all of these "to do's"? Thanks. Lynn -----Original Message----- From: Buchanan, John Sent: Wednesday, August 22, 2001 3:12 PM To: Blair, Lynn; Kowalke, Terry Cc: Buchanan, John; Zadow, Raetta; Berger, Larry Subject: New Hire Lunch Notes Lynn, to summarize and remind us of the to do's from the luncheon. Scott liked having a daily training agenda. Terry and I should do the Nomination and Scheduling presentation to new hires that was done for IT. Jacob needs to be scheduled to spend time in Gas Control Lynn is going to contact Dan Pribble about taking new hires to a compressor station. Teams need to be comfortable in training new hires in all aspects wheatear they know how long new hires will be on their team. Other than that Scott and Jacob seemed satisfied with their training and progress in Customer Service. John Buchanan
