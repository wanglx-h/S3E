Subject: RE: Gas Logistics NNG Bushton PVR Report
Don, this is great. This report was a big hurdle for us. I will check with the team on how it is working. Thanks for all your support as we go forward in our Business Objects training. Thanks.

Today I turned this over to the Gas Logistics South End Team. The report is available via the intranet web server Infosource.ets.enron.com. I walked the team through the login process, refreshed and printed the report. I plan to demonstrate how this report was built to the Gas Logistics report team being coordinated by Mike Bodnar. I will do so at one of our earliest meetings. Please let me know if you have questions. u Don Powell Manager Business Information E-mail: Don.Powell@enron.com n Enron Transportation Services phone: 713-853-5801 fax: 713-646-8000 Web: <http://www.enron.com>
