Subject: Happy New Year and Other Business
I hope you and the family have a great New Year. We are not sure where we will be this week, so I don't think we'll make it to the party. I hope you have fun. I saw the e-mail from Kerry Notestine and called him. Twanda sent the information he needed re McGowan. He's got everything ready, but he's not sure you got to speak with the Weil Gotchal attorneys to see if it was OK to file the lawsuit? Please call him. Thanks. I'm filing (Project April).
