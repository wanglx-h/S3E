Try Lynn Richardson for a primary contact. BUT, she would not be my first choice for reliable good information. ---------------------- Forwarded by Cara Semperger/PDX/ECT on 03/13/2001 01:42 PM --------------------------- Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. From: "LYNN RICHARDSON" <lerichrd@wapa.gov> 03/11/2001 09:06 PM To: <amy.clemons@enron.com>, <Cara.Semperger@enron.com> cc: Subject: WACM Transmission Losses Attached is a spreadsheet showing your entity's loss obligation to WACM for the period March 1 through 10. You have already received March 1-5 accounting last week. However, I changed the tracking slightly and now all the days of each month appear in one file, so that March 6th through the 10th is the only new data you are receiving. Please ensure that you are calculating and delivering the concurrent losses with the parent tag. As of this time, there were no prices posted for Palo Verde nonfirm for March 9th or 10th. Please let me know if you have specific feedback about something in the list or if you have any questions. Thanks. Lynn Richardson Public Utilities Specialist RMR (970) 461-7440 - EnronMarch2001.xls
