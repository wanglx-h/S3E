Subject: Conference Call with Houston Houston has requested we sit down with them on the phone and go over all the in-the-money contracts we have. By their count we have about 50. They want to account for each and understand why we may not be delivering on them. Ed Baughman will be sending his master list in advance of a 11:30 call in Mt. Bachelor. Please send at least one representative from each of the regional desks to discuss the list. Thanks, Steve
