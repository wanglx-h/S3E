Not a problem if the employee does not date it. The issue of signature by the company that the agreement is not fully executed until it is signed by company. MHC -----Original Message----- From: Bryant, Dana Sent: Friday, July 20, 2001 11:38 AM To: Cash, Michelle Subject: another question Michelle, I have run across a few agreements where the employee has signed the agreement but not dated it. Is this something that could potentially be a problem? I think that, for our (exec comp) purposes, the agreement is not actually in effect until it is signed by the person "offering" the terms. Is this true? Thank you Dana
