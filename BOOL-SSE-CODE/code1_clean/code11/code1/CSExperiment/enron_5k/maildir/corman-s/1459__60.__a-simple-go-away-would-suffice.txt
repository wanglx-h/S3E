Subject: A simple "go away" would suffice
Robert, A simple "Enron does not believe its load forecasts can be improved" or "go to ****" would suffice. Since there was no reply to my previous email, I have to assume that it wasn't forwarded to the people in Enron who would know how to use improved accuracy in their trading strategy. I will try other ways to contact the appropriate people in Enron. Craig
