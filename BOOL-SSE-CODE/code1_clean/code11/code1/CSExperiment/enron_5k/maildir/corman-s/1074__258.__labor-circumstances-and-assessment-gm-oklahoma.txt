I focused on specifics related to labor unions, construction, and operations. Please call if further reviews or clarifications are desired. I will be prepared to support your efforts and determinations as this opportunity is developed. I have received the two UAW collective bargaining agreements however, it would be premature to tackle those documents until Enron O&M objectives are defined. The opportunity to support pre-construction PLA discussions, in concert with GM, should be anticipated Regards, Rj.
