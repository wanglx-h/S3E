Kim, who do you think you are fooling? A drink or two? Really?!?! I think I have heard that one from you before. I don't even say shit like that anymore because when I say shit like that I end up partying harder than I would have had I just kept my mouth shut. But in respect for your new job we will make sure you are home and tucked in bed early! :) See ya soon!
