Subject: RE: Account Receivables
Lynn/Rick, Frank sent this to me last week and I have been working on it but I have one item for $1,406.01 that was listed on a report that Frank had that I can't seem to find on the A/R - maybe Alice can help me find it. After I find that entry, I was going to get it to Jean Blair to get the writeoff forms written up.
