Subject: CAISO NOTIFICATION--Attention Requested: 10-Minute Settlement Mar
 ket Simulation II
Market Participants, Attention: Settlements and Scheduling Personnel Your participation is requested in the second iteration of 10-Minute Settlement Market Simulation. As communicated on 7/20/00, the ISO has postponed the August 1, 2000, implementation of 10-minute settlements in order to accommodate additional end-to-end testing and market simulation. The ISO's new target for implementation is the last week of August, 2000, contingent upon the successful completion of the second 10-Minute Settlement Market Simulation and ISO's 10 day written notice to FERC. The second 10-Minute Settlement Market Simulation is scheduled to begin on Tuesday, August 1, 2000. The ISO will hold a kickoff meeting conference call on Thursday, July 27, from 1:30 - 3:00 p.m., to summarize the status of the first Market Simulation, discuss the second Market Simulation logistics, and review the Market Simulation Plan. All Market Participants are strongly urged to participate in this simulation to identify any outstanding issues that may affect implementation for Scheduling Coordinators and the ISO. Please respond to Cathy Young at cyoung@caiso.com by 3:00 p.m. on Friday if you intend to participate. The remainder of this message contains the kickoff meeting Agenda, Market Simulation Schedule, and necessary system set up documentation for the simulation. 10 MINUTE SETTLEMENT MARKET SIMULATION II KICKOFF CONFERENCE CALL July 27, 1:30 - 3:00 p.m. Conference Number 877-670-4111 Passcode 246870 Agenda: * Review of first Market Simulation * System Requirements * ADS * SI * Metering * Meter Data * Refer to attached document: Metering August Mkt Sim1 * MDAS Online work around * Schedule Data Requirements * RMR dispatch * OOS * Interties predispatch * SC provide all DA market and supplemental energy bid data Proposed Market Simulation Schedule (refer to attached Detailed Test Plan) * Monday , July 31 ADS/SI/Metering connectivity * Tuesday, August 1 DA market run for td 8/2/00 * Wednesday, August 2 Real time market for td 8/2/00 (HE 11 -- 17) DA market run for td 8/3/00 * Thursday, August 3 Real time market for td 8/3/00 (HE 11 -- 17) * Friday, August 4 Run settlements for 8/2/00 * Monday, August 7 Run settlements for 8/3/00 Publish settlements for 8/2/00 * Tuesday, August 8 Publish settlements for 8/3/00 * Wednesday, August 9 Market Participant Review * Thursday, August 10 Market Participant Review * Friday, August 11 Conference call to review market sim. Attached please find the following documentation for your use in setting up your systems for Market Simulation. a. ADS Market Simulation Configuration b. ADS_PAR Installation c. Software Configuration for SI Development System It is important that you use this information to prepare your system setup ASAP. It may be necessary to have your IT department allow traffic through your firewalls to and from the ADS market simulation IP address and port. Please refer to the ADS Market Simulation Configuration document for detailed instructions. If you are interested in verbally receiving RMR pre-dispatches during the market simulation, please let Cathy Young know when you sign up. You may contact Christine Vangelatos at cvangelatos@caiso.com or (916) 351-2142 if you have any questions or concerns regarding ADS or SI configuration.
