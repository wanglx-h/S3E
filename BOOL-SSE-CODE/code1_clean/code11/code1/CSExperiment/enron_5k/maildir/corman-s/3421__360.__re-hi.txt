Subject: RE: hi!
Why would you need to come back? You're the one always ripping on your friends for never wanting to hang out with any chicks!! I wasn't meaning that towards you But if you feel like making some sort of weak ass attempt at making fun because you still think I'm a freekin' lesbian then go right ahead! -----Original Message----- From: Mark.Guzman@enron.com [mailto:Mark.Guzman@enron.com] Sent: Wednesday, April 18, 2001 3:13 PM To: Katie.Trullinger@wfsg.com Subject: RE: hi! I thought of a great comeback for that one but since I haven't heard from you in a while I am going to be nice
