Subject: Auction Funds
Hi all! I am finalizing the auction and plan on sending in all the checks by Friday (due to tax purposes). It would be great if you could have a check to me by Friday at 9:00 AM, as I will turn the checks in on Friday. The following is a record of what is outstanding: Lysa Akin, $150. Mark Guzman, $325. Jeff Shields, $450. Please make checks to CASA or Raphael House, feel free to write 2 checks, or 1 check to the charity of your choice. Enron will match your donation. I am off the rest of the week, however, will check my email and will stop by on Friday to take care of this. Thanks for your help and happy new year!! Mollie
