I'm currently working with several organizations across the country looking for energy traders, coordinators, analysts and schedulers. These are great opportunities to change location or better ones position quickly. I'd like to schedule a ten minute telephone conversation to discuss these positions and determine whether or not you may have interest or may be able to assist with these openings. Please reply or call me at 630-990-7510 at your earliest convenience. I look forward to speaking with you soon. Best Regards, Todd Kubicki Kappa Search, Inc. tkubicki@kappasearch.com
