Greg: We wanted to follow up after our recent efforts. Ron has tried (unsucessfully) to reach you over the last couple of weeks and we are fully sensitive to how difficult it is to find time to speak these days. In that context, Ron and I felt that a brief note might be best. As you know, we worked at Jeff Donahue and Mitch Taylor's request for several days to develop a synthesis of the Enron Wholesale Services business model. This model centered around the cash/earnings generation power of Enron North America's gas and power franchise and the related working capital dynamics. We also began to develop a model to explain how VaR, volatility, and price drive Enron Wholesale Services' proprietary trading profitability. When we were asked to leave a week ago this effort was well underway, but still incomplete. We believe that these analyses, as well as an integrated view of the Enron Wholesale Services business model, will be central to any investor's due diligence process. To the extent you feel this process needs to be accelerated or enhanced, we stand ready to help at this critical time. Finally, we have billed you for the capital markets diagnostic work completed several weeks ago. As agreed, we only invoiced you for two weeks of work. Please let us know if you have any questions about this work. Once again, we want to emphasize our personal commitment to supporting you and Enron in any way possible.
