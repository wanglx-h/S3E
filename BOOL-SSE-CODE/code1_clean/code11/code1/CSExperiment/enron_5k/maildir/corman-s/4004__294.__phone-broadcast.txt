Subject: Phone Broadcast
Ava ran me a list of the people on the phone broadcast. Sheila, your name is on the list. Are you getting phone messages? She also cleaned up some old names on the list and added the new people. Who do you guys think would be the best person to have responsibility for updates on this list? Should we make it Ava and Alma with them backing each other up? Thanks. Lynn
