Thanks Fran! I was just running the report to do the same thing! I'll take care of it all today. ds -----Original Message----- From: Chang, Fran Sent: Tuesday, November 27, 2001 9:55 AM To: Scholtes, Diana; Crandall, Sean Subject: NCPA deal review Importance: High Diana and Sean: Up to 11/26/01, 1. we are missing the annuities for 11/7, 11/18, 11/19, 11/22, 11/23, and 11/24 2. we need to restore HE23-24 for deal# 517676.1 for 11/2/01 (lightload sale in NP15) in scheduling Please let me know if you need any help entering the annuities or restoring the HE23-HE24 scheduling (for 11/2/01 for deal 517676.1). As the month-end is approaching, I am hoping we can clear the above issues up before Settlements captures the wrong P&L. Thanks, Fran
