Subject: Organizational Changes
On November 8, the Office of the Chairman, issued an important communication, announcing significant organizational changes in Enron's worldwide operations. The purpose of this memo is to share with you the decisions that are underway to restructure Enron,s operations in South America. The basic organizational framework has been set. As you know, Diomedes Christodoulou and Jim Bannantine will be assuming new responsibilities within Enron. Replacing them will be Orlando Gonzalez and Joe Kishkill, who will become the Co-Presidents of South America, reporting to Dave Delainey and John Lavorato. They will share overall responsibility; however, Orlando,s focus will be on direct sales origination, commercial/government relationships and regulatory issues. Joe,s focus will be on wholesale origination, financial and operating performance and overall country management. In addition, Orlando will continue as President and CEO of Elektro until its ultimate sale. The existing, large integrated asset base in South America (excluding Elektro) will be managed and operated by Rebecca McDonald and Jim Hughes in Enron Global Assets, which is part of Enron Wholesale Services under Mark Frevert. Ultimately, there will be very close coordination in both Brazil and Argentina between Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets to ensure that our reputation in South America is protected, our asset positions are being managed prudently and that commercial opportunities surrounding these assets are pursued. The remaining natural gas and electrical commercial activities in South America will be organized around the highly successful North American network business model. This model employs people, market making, physical commodities, capital and assets to provide reliable, flexible and high-value products to our customers. It is people and intellectual capital based and enjoys high rates of return on invested capital. In the interest of pursuing this strategy, the following teams will report to Joe and Orlando: The Commercial Origination team will be lead by Brett Wiggs. The team will focus on covering South American markets, primarily Brazilian and Argentine natural gas and electricity, with the following goals: ? Generating new, innovative, reliable and high value products and services needed by the market by utilizing our commodity, asset and capital capabilities; ? Providing those products and services across South America and across the value chain, including wholesale and retail, based upon the highest value opportunity; ? Finding structural value arbitrages in the South American market and move quickly to capitalize; ? Assisting the Risk Management and Trading organization in managing the overall risk of the organization; ? Managing all new power and asset development opportunities in South America consistent with this strategy, and ? Providing the Risk Management and Trading organization information and deal flow. The Commercial Origination team will consist of a diverse group of people who work as a single team which bring the required skills including commodity, capital, regulatory, asset, development, market, structuring, deal execution, finance and country knowledge necessary to reach our goals. The Trading and Risk Management team will be headed by Remi Collonges. The team will continue to develop pricing information and manage the price book for the relevant energy markets in support of the wholesale and direct sales efforts. Additionally, the team will work toward implementation of actively trading South American energy commodities. This group will be responsible for managing Enron South America,s overall risk and will have a direct reporting relationship with John Lavorato in his role as head of the Americas risk activities. The Argentine effort will be integrated into the overall South American Commercial Origination and Trading and Risk Management groups; however, we will continue to maintain an Argentine office headed by Michael Guerriero. The goal of the reorganization is to create a flat team oriented organization that is very market and commercially focused. The following support functions will assist the overall business objectives of the commercial team and will report into Joe and Orlando, plus into their line functions in Houston. The overall goal is to ensure that the South American business units have an adequate support organization to evaluate opportunities, as well as manage day-to-day business and risk. Otherwise, the Houston infrastructure will provide resources as needed to manage peak requirements in South America, not unlike other businesses in Enron Americas. These groups include: The Government Affairs team, which will be headed by Sergio Assad, will manage the relationships with the relevant regulatory agencies as well as governmental ministries. The primary regulatory goal will be to facilitate, in the near term, substantive changes to the regulatory rules to allow a functioning wholesale traded market in Brazil and Argentina. Sergio will assume his responsibilities upon completion of the Elektro sale. During this interim period, Jose Bestard will continue to be in charge of the regulatory function. Once Sergio makes the transition, he will also report to Rick Shapiro in Enron Government Affairs. The Finance team will be headed by Britaldo Soares. The team will manage the interface with Enron Global Finance. Britaldo will transition from his current duties at Elektro upon completion of the Elektro sale. Britaldo will also report to Joe Deffner in Enron Global Finance. Rob Gay will be assisting Britaldo during the transition, while continuing his work on the Cuiaba project. The Legal team, which will be lead by Randy Young, as general counsel, and John Novak, as deputy general counsel, will manage South America,s legal requirements. Randy and John will also report to Mark Haedicke in Enron Wholesale Services - Legal Department. Miguel Padron will become Chief of Staff. Human Resources, Information Technology, Treasury, Accounting & Reporting, as well as Administration will report to Miguel. This will bring focus to essential, but non-commercial functions, as well as more efficiently manage key matrix reporting relationships with Enron. Miguel will also report to David Oxley in Enron Wholesale Services ) Human Resources and Wes Colwell in Enron Wholesale Services ) Business Analysis and Reporting. These changes are consistent with Enron's evolving business strategy and reflect our continuing commitment to grow the company by maximizing our financial and intellectual capital. However, in line with the new organizational structure and the near term potential for business in the region, further budget reductions will be necessary. People directly affected will be notified shortly. Enron is committed to continue the successful implementation of its businesses in South America. We believe that as the markets develop, we are uniquely positioned to leverage Enron,s core capabilities and create shareholder value.
