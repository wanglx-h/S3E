Subject: Storage Business Objects Morning Report
Would all of you be available to meet in my office tomorrow (Thursday) at 9:00 a.m. to talk about the morning report for storage that we do each day. I would appreciate your input on the status and how we go forward to simplify the report. Thanks. Lynn
