Subject: Spreadsheet of EES positions
Richard: I understand from Elliot that we want to keep the spreadsheet of EES positions separate from our Fundies site. I started a file at O:\Portland\WestDesk\RenewablePowerDesk\Shared\Internal intelligence\EES Position based on the info. you provided to Jesse in an e-mail dated 10/8. The spreadsheet is attached. *Will this spreadsheet meet our needs? *Is the location suitable? -How limited should access to this be? *What is the most efficient mechanism by which to update this information - i.e., will you update it directly, or coordinate with me? Thanks, Jenny
