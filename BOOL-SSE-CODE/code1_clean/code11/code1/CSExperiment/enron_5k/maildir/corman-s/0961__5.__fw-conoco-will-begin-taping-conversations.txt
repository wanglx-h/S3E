These recordings will benefit us all by verifying the accuracy of our verbal agreements and reducing the chance for miscommunication. Working in this fast-paced environment, many of you are already familiar with recording transactions conducted by telephone. Recording will occur automatically and continue throughout the conversation. There will be no notice or recording indicator. Please call me if you have any questions about this arrangement. We appreciate your business ant the opportunity to serve you. Sincerely, Jerry Wheatley" Dennis P. Lee ETS Gas Logistics (713) 853-1715 dennis.lee@enron.com
