Subject: Christmas party December 16th
Guz, We're having a shindig on the 16th of December and I need your address to send out an official invitation with directions and all that jazz. Hope all is well and drop me a line when you get the chance. Forward this to Sully if you have his email as I can't find his address anywhere. Thanks and talk to you later, -Boyd ______________________________________________________________________________ _______ Get more from the Web. FREE MSN Explorer download : http://explorer.msn.com
