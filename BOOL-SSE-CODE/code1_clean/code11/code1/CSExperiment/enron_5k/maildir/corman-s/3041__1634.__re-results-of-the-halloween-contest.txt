Subject: Re: Results of the Halloween Contest!
I for one believed the judging to be objective and fair. Clearly, "price caps" are out of favor. Enron's totally impartial judges, and FERC's independent analysis, reached the same (appropriate) conclusion. As for fatigues, they are difficult to see, so how can one expect to be evaluated on a costume that is visually disadvantaged. The foundation of Enron's business is competition. Obviously, the exceptional wisdom of the independent judges recognized that cycling is a highly competitive activity. Therefor, a cycling costume reflected the spirit of Enron and the Halloween competition. My suggestion to Mr. Rasmussen for next years competition is that he wear lycra camouflage.
