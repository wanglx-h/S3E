Subject: Employee Memo re: Changes to HR Policy and Employee Programs
The attached memo is to be distributed to all US-based employees this afternoon. We've opted to include the various changes to HR policies and employee programs in one consolidated memo to reduce the number of negative e-mails employees receive over the next few weeks. Please review at your earliest convenience and provide changes to me. If I do not receive changes from you by 3:30 p.m. today, I will assume you have none. Thanks for your prompt reply, Terrie James Ext. 3-7727 EB4528 terrie.james@enron.com <mailto:terrie.james@enron.com>
