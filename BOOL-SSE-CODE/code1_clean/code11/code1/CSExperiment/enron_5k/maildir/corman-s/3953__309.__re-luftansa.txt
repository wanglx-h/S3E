Almost 100% certain that its just me. I'd rather have good flights and spend the money on just me (i.e. we can share hotel costs). -----Original Message----- From: LGras91577@aol.com [mailto:LGras91577@aol.com] Sent: Thursday, November 29, 2001 4:28 PM To: Corman, Shelley Subject: Re: Luftansa Shelley, I also found out that Luth. did fly out of Houston. They were sold out on the 10th and only had 3 seats on the 11th. I will do more looking when we know for sure the dates. If the prices are really high, then Fred may stay home, and I will go. Is it looking like just you, are is Kim going also? Liz
