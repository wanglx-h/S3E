Hi guys, I'm looking for a purchase deal that the counterparty is showing, but we're not. You guys were working that night. The criteria are as follows: date: 1-23-01 HE 22 100 MW @ $390.00 HE 23-24 125 MW @ $390.00 I have done a few searches and I find nothing. Please let me know either way on this so I can close it out with Houston. VA
