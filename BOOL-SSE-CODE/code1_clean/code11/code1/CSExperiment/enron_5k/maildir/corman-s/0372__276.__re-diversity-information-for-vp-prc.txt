Subject: RE: Diversity information for VP PRC
Who will get them? I am happy to sit down with him in a privileged conversation and discuss those statistics, which I think is the best way to protect the privilege. Otherwise, if it goes to him at his request, then there is no protection if we find undesirable results. -----Original Message----- From: Corteselli, Gina Sent: Tuesday, July 10, 2001 11:13 AM To: Cash, Michelle; Oxley, David Subject: Diversity information for VP PRC Hi Michelle; Dovie told me that she has had a chat with you regarding the diversity stats we were preparing for the VP PRC on 23 July. Delainey had asked specifically for these stats, and that's why wewere including them. Is there any way that we can provide the data, perhaps marking it attny privilidge? If not, can we discuss this with Delainey so that he is aware of the reasons PEP PRC cannot provide it? I'd apprecuate your thoughts. Thanks, Gina
