Subject: PRC Action Plan Form from HR
Attached is the action form HR has indicated we are to use for Level 3 performer. This form will be in addition to the PEP system Peformance review form. In discussions with Shelly we will use the form for all Level 3, but ONLY input "target dates" for those employees with issues. Thought I would pass it on and let you modify as you need for your reviews. If I have throughly confused you, give me a call. Thanks. Lynn
