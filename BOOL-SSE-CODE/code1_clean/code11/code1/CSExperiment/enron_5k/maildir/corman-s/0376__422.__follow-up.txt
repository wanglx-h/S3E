Subject: Follow-Up
Now that we have Alina's initial visit out of the way and she has stopped talking about the bad ("jaman") nurse that gave her the shots, I guess it's time to plan round two. Please let me know the appropriate timing to schedule a follow-up visit for further immunizations. Thanks Shelley Corman 713-853-7083
