Subject: LEGAL REVIEW OF THIRD PARTY ELECTRONIC TRADING PLATFORMS
In order to ensure adequate, consistent legal review of on-line terms and conditions governing use of third party electronic trading platforms, you must have all registration documentation (including, for example, password applications and access agreements) approved by the On-Line Trading Legal Contact before such documentation is submitted or executed. Any document that requires acceptance by &clicking8 should be treated like any other legal document. You are not authorized to accept any such click agreement without written approval of the On-Line Trading Legal Contact. In addition, the On-Line Trading Legal Contact must review and approve all product descriptions and other on-line terms and conditions applicable to a product before a password may be used to trade that product on a third party electronic trading platform. Accordingly, before any master user or subuser uses a password to trade a product, he or she must confirm that the On-Line Trading Legal Contact has approved all applicable product descriptions and terms and conditions applicable to such product. The current On-Line Trading Legal Contact is Mark Greenberg (extension 58897) (or in his absence, Mark Taylor (extension 37459)).
