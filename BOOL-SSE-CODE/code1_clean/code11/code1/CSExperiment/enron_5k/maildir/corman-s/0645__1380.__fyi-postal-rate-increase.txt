Subject: FYI--Postal Rate Increase
There hasn't been a lot of press about the new postal rate increase that begins on Monday, January 7, so I am forwarding a portion of the press release (see below) to you for your information. WASHINGTON * The Governors of the U.S. Postal Service today announced that they would allow the recommended decision of the Postal Rate Commission to raise the price of a First Class letter to 34 cents "under protest." New rates for all classes of mail will begin on January 7, 2001.
