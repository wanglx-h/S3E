Subject: Steve's Staff Meeting - Holiday Change
Due to the President's Day Holiday on next Monday, February 18, Steve will hold his staff meeting on Tuesday, February 19, same time, same location. As a courtesy to all attendees, Steve is asking, once again, that all participants arrive by 2:30 pm allowing for a prompt start time and for discussions to flow in an effective manner. Your contributions to the discussions are crucial and deserve to be heard by all concerned. Achieving this objective is why we ask your cooperation. Because our attendee list has grown significantly in the past few months, arrangements have been made with facilities to have a standing order of chairs available for your convenience. Please call if you have any concerns or questions. adr Audrey D. Robertson Transwestern Pipeline Company email address: audrey.robertson@enron.com (713) 853-5849 (713) 646-2551 Fax
