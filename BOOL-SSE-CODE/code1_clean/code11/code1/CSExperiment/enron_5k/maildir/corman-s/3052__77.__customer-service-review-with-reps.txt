Subject: Customer Service Review with Reps
Shelley, attached is the first draft for the plan to talk with the reps for all three pipes on Wednesday. This will be a two phase approach. We (Sheila, Fran and I) will talk with the teams on Wednesday reviewing a high level plan. Then we will put the teams into groups to talk about 5 topics we picked from the NNG meeting. Then we will follow up with Donna to develop a training plan. Fran and I are meeting again tomorrow (Tuesday) at 3:30 if you want to join us or have comments. Thanks. Lynn
