Subject: Hi There
Today Chris called to tell me that Liz Gras will not be traveling with me and that I should leave on Dec 15 instead of Dec 13 (Tomorrow). This is all a shock. I will have to travel by myself. I have never traveled internationally before and I am a bit scared -- as I'm sure that you were this past summer when you visited. I know everyone in Kazakhstan will be nice, but I am not looking forward to customs. I am very excited to see you though. Depending on how long that I will have to be in Kazakhstan, I may try to come home after court and have Alina escorted to Moscow. Kim (or Kim & I) may travel to Moscow to pick her up after the New Years holiday. I will be sad if I have to leave her behind for a few more days. But I might have to accept this arrangement if my work calls me back to Houston. So many times my schedule changes that it is difficult at work. I know that you experienced similar difficulties with you flight plans this summer. I will bring pictures of your visit this summer. I will also bring warm clothes! I received an email from a new family that hopes to adopt Zhuldiz. I am so happy to hear that she has a family.
