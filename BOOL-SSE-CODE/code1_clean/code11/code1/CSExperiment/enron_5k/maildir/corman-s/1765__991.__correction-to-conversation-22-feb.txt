Subject: Correction to conversation 22 Feb.
Robin & Jeff: Mary Hain asked that I advise you she had one change to the information she gave you yesterday. Instead of saying, "It doesn't mean the FERC hasn't set a rate..." you should say, "It doesn't mean the FERC has accepted a rate and that a rate isn't on file". If you have any questions about this, you can contact Mary on her cell phone (503/807-0928) AFTER 12:45pm Cnetral Time. Lysa Akin Ass't to Mary Hain 503/464-7927
