Subject: Dinner Plans
Hi Cyndi, Chad does not have soccer practice tonight so we are free to meet for dinner pretty much anytime. I know you are trying to tie up loose ends at the office and I could stand to work a little late tonight. How does 7 PM at Cafe Express sound? Kim, can you pick up Chad and meet me there? Gaby says she may take Chad to Lucas later this afternoon. Please pay Gaby if you see her -- as I have given her the day off tomorrow.
