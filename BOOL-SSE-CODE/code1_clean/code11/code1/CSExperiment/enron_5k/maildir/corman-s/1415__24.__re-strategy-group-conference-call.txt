Subject: Re: Strategy Group conference call
I am available at 3:00 Wednesday. I agree that we should convene and discuss. I would be surprised if we have grounds to challenge, but we can keep our fingers crossed. If we don't, then we could discuss strategy for negotiations. Thanks.

He will be at the facility Wednesday morning and will have a report about what happened Friday and the possible grounds for an election challenge. I think this is a good idea, Is it ok with you? If so, is the time convenient? ---- This email may contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of the intended recipient(s).
