Since then it's gone down 8.28% to 50 1/8. kensey Click here to see the full recommendation with annotated graph [IMAGE] [IMAGE] [IMAGE] [IMAGE] kensey's RecommendList Reply Unsubscribe [IMAGE] [IMAGE] ClearStation is not an investment advisory service, nor a registered investment advisor or broker-dealer and does not purport to tell or suggest which securities members should buy or sell for themselves.
