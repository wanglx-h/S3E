Thanks -----Original Message----- From: Kean, Steven J.

Also, after our meeting we had talked about making a proposal to them (specifically, we were at least going to describe the actions we took so they might have the opportunity to acknowledge that we had done enough). I know everyone is busy, but I would like us to get ahead of this while we have a good environment for resolution. -----Original Message----- From: Lighthill, Sandra Sent: Tuesday, November 20, 2001 4:56 PM To: Cash, Michelle; Kean, Steven J. Cc: Yowman, Andrea Subject: Follow-Up on OFCCP Meeting Michelle and Steve, Have we received the letter from the OFCCP regarding the closing of the Corporate Management Review? This is the letter we are expecting as a result of your meeting in Washington, D.C. with the OFCCP about 6-7 weeks ago. Should I contact Rosalee Fleming since the letter could have gone to Ken Lay? Can you please let me know? Thanks so much. Regards, Sandra
