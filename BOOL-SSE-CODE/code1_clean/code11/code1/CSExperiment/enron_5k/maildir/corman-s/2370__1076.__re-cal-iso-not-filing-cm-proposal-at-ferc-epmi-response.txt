Subject: Re: Cal ISO Not Filing CM Proposal at FERC - EPMI Response?
Here's my solution. FERC should tell the Cal ISO to file the stakeholder developed congestion management proposal arguing that it has been agreed to in the stakeholder process and that the ISO Board has no authority to do something else because they are not properly constituted. We could also argue that the FERC should order the ISO executives to hire a consulting firm that will propose a slate of candidates and argue for a government similar to what has been proposed for RTO West. This will help us in ultimately putting the West RTOs together.

Mary informs me that the Cal ISO has filed (1-30-01) with FERC that it will not be filing a new Congestion Management proposal at FERC as required in previous Orders. She thinks now is an opportune time to challenge the legitimacy of the new Cal ISO Board (Gov Davis' actions). I also think that we need to put forward our own solution (if we have one). I would appreciate everyone's opinion as to the (a) likelihood that FERC would finally address the matter, (b) end result if FERC does deal with the issue, (c) and the politics in Sacramento / CPUC of taking this position. Also, who else is going to weigh in on our proposal? Jim
