Subject: APS Losses
Please show 1 mw to APS from EPE for losses on RT transmission that we used on 1/18/01. This needs to be put in HE 24 MST--that's 23 PST :-)--tonight 1/22/01. Call APS tranny and confirm with them that you are showing 1 mw LOSSES for the hour. Please send me an email letting me know when this is done. Thanks Jesse
