Subject: Derivatives course
Bill, I would really like to sign up for the derivatives course being offered on June 4th and 5th. I had already requested the 1st thru the 5th off in order to attend a wedding in LA however, I would like to attend the course and if selected would cut my trip short. Let me know. Thank you.
