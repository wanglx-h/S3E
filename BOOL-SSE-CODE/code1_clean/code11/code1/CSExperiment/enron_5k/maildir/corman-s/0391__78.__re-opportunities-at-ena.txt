Subject: Re: Opportunities at ENA
Sheila, HR is setting up interviews with Carlos next week, and you will be on the interviewer list. Thanks! How would you like references run on Bonnie? Internally or pre-Enron. Let me know, since this is the first time I have received that request (given that I am new in this role!). Thanks.

I would also like to run some references on Bonnie Nelson.
