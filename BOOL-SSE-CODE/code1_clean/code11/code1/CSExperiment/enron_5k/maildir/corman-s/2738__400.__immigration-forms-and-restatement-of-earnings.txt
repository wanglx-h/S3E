Subject: Immigration forms and restatement of earnings
Michelle, On the INS forms, there are two places which refer to: Gross Annual Income: $100 billion Net Annual Income: $979 million Currently when Tindall & Foster are completing the forms they use our annual report to complete these. Would you advise if we should revised these with the recent events and include the appropriate statement/restatement with the annual report we submit? Or continue utilizing only the annual reports and the figures held within? Thank you.
