Subject: receivables
do you know that your receivables have been increasing over the past few months? currently i understand that you have about $800mm in outstanding receivables. i don't know what the aging looks like, but it seems like a big number. we found this while we were trying to find out why we are having a hard time getting a handle on funds flow.
