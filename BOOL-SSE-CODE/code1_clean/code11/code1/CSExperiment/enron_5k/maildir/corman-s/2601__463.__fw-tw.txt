Can I get electronic copies of these, they have volumes and margins and appear to back up the revenue projections. 2002 File looks like s\marketing\twfinmkt_anly\Tw\twfin\2001\misc\[plan_forecast_design.xls]\summary. 2001 file looks like s\marketing\twfinmkt_anly\tw\twfin\2001\forecast-CE\[ce 3-2001.xls]model _source_data. If the same exists for 2000 can we get it as well. I would like as soon as possible and you can email to the cc addresses as well. -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net)
