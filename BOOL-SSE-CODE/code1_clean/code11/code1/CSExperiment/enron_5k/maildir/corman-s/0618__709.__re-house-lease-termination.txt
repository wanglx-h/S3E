Subject: Re: House Lease Termination
We won't know until February. Jane Allen 12/13/2000 08:12 AM To: Louise Kitchen/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Jane Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT, Robert Jones/Corp/Enron@enron, Michelle Cash/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: House Lease Termination On the advise of Michelle Cash, we are sending out letters by Fed Ex today to both the real estate agent (Greenwood King) and the landlord (Eileen Urban) giving 30 days notice on termination. If they come back to us wanting the remainder of the rent through the lease date of July 14, 2001, we will negotiate subletting. Louise, do you still have someone in mind who may be interested?
