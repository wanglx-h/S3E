Nice tradeoff... Xcel Energy Provides $10 Million for Renewable Energy Xcel Energy announced last week that it chose eight Minnesota renewable energy projects to receive nearly $10 million in funding. More than $5 million will fund a hydropower facility at St. Anthony Falls in Minneapolis. The remaining funds will go toward two projects to convert cow manure and solid and liquid waste from the corn and pea canning process into methane for power production, one project to produce power from methane that is currently being wasted at a corn processing plant, one rebate program for grid-connected solar power systems, one solar power system on the roof of the Science Museum of Minnesota, one wind turbine installation at a school, and the installation of six wind turbines of a new design. The projects are funded by the state's Renewable Development Fund, to which Xcel Energy must contribute $500,000 annually for each nuclear-spent-fuel cask stored outside the Prairie Island nuclear plant after January 1st, 1999. The fund currently amounts to more than $16 million. The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission must approve Xcel Energy's choice of projects.
