Subject: Administrative Functions
Well, guys sorry it has taken me so long to get this out. But attached is the list of functions that we could designate certain assistants to be primary and secondary knowledge base. Please review and let me know of changes and additions you would like to see by Tuesday, July 17th. Then I will recap for the Wednesday meeting. Thanks. Lynn
