Subject: RE: Oneok Meeting - August 29, 2001
I talked with Delaine today to firm up our meeting on the 29th. Here is the plan. 11:30 - 12:00 - Lunch in the building (Ava can you get Trebeards) 12:00 - 4:30 - Discuss: Midcontinent Market Center I/C at Bushton Points that are on the wrong OBA Imbalances on the Gathering OBA American Processing Issues (Robert) Let me know if we need to add anything else or have any quetions. I think this will take the majority of the afternoon. Ava, please get us a room (preferrably 4102) for the afternoon. Attendees from Oneok are: Delaine Kurth, Kim Hardman, Sherry Rogers, maybe one other person. Thanks. Lynn
