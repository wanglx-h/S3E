Rick, no problem, I think it would be good to have at least one of them there. Thanks.

We may receive some questions about the new contract management system and capacity release system that is being implemented on January 15th for TW. I believe it would be beneficial to have Michelle or Dennis attend the meetings and "mingle" with their customers. What do you think?

Rick, Michelle Lokay forwarded this to me because she believes that I should attend. Let me know if me or Dennis will be attending.
