Subject: Re: Guest List for Shower
Thank you, Shelley, for your offer. Our clubhouse was not available, so I have decided to have the shower here at my house. I am dealing with my "problems" and have decided life goes on! It will be fine. I am looking forward to entertaining - we haven't done anything like this in a while - too long! Yes, I will add those names to the guest list. I am very comfortable with the number of guests. Talk to you soon, Barbara
