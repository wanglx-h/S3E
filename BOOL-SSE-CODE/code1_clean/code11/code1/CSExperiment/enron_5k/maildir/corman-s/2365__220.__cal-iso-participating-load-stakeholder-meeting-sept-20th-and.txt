Subject: Cal-ISO Participating Load Stakeholder Meeting (Sept. 20th) and V
 endor Fair (Sept. 21st)
The ISO will be hosting a Participating Load Stakeholder meeting on September 20, 2000 at the ISO. The meeting is a broad stakeholder meeting to help refine our load participation programs for 2001. Much of the day will be committed to presentations and discussions on lessons learned from 2000 and proposals for 2001, including technical standards, contractual issues, and load management. Some vendors have approached the ISO with systems that would aggregate loads, give them an opportunity to curtail based on day ahead energy prices, and provide the curtailment instructions and verifications. This type of program may be ultimately sold to ESPs or IOUs. In order to accelerate the testing of such systems the ISO may sponsor a pilot program to test the system/approach with selected vendors. The pilot program will test the concepts, the interfaces, and assist in bringing together vendors, ESPs, SCs, and the IOUs as we move forward toward improving demand responsiveness in our markets. We have reserved about 1 -2 hours in the afternoon, to allow 3-4 vendors to present their approaches to the stakeholder group. In addition, we welcome you to visit a vendor fair that the ISO is hosting on September 21, 2000. The ISO has experienced considerable interest from the market place in such a vendor fair that would include entities providing Data Processing Gateway technology for both Generators and Loads in the Participating Ancillary Services Load Program. This effort is being encouraged to develop multiple solutions pertaining to installations of direct telemetry for Generators and Load providing Ancillary Services to the ISO markets. The agendas are attached for both events, including directions and lodging information. Please RSVP by September 13, 2000 to Sue Happ at shapp@caiso.com. Thank you. <<AGENDA 9_20_00_timelines3_.doc>> <<AGENDA 9_21_00_timelines3_.doc>> <<Lodging and Directions.pdf>> Keoni Almeida California Independent System Operator phone: 916/608-7053 pager: 916/814-7352 alpha page: 9169812000.1151268@pagenet.net e-mail: <mailto:kalmeida@caiso.com> - AGENDA 9_20_00_timelines3_.doc - AGENDA 9_21_00_timelines3_.doc - Lodging and Directions.pdf
