Subject: More on Application Letter
Liz - Right after I had Kim run over with the revised form and put it in the overnight, Chris called me to say that the application will probably need the "sworn and subscribed" language before the notary stamp. Do you have a typewriter that you could type this in above the notary stamp? Or perhaps feed it through your computer printer? I sent three signed and notarized copies -- so you have a few extras to play with. Here is the missing language STATE OF TEXAS COUNTY OF HARRIS Sworn and subscribed before me on this 26th day of November, 2001. My conversation with Chris was quite different than my conversation with Ginger. While she said that it would be more convenient if we set a date like Jan 5 to travel to be able to buy the tickets in advance and hopefully get better fares. She also acted like it is not out of the question that travel around Dec 17 might be possible if one didn't mind being away at Christmas. On my voice mail she left a message that my dossier had been received in Astana. When I called her back she said that this was a mistake -- that what she meant was that it had been picked up at the embassy and was expected in Astana on Thurs or Fri. You can call me at home tonight if you want to talk.
