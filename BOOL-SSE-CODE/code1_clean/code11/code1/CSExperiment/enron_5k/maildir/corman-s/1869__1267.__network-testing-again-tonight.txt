Subject: Network Testing Again Tonight
The Networking team will be testing the connection again this evening starting at 7:30 PM. There is a slight possibility that they will need to continue the testing over the weekend as well. If you have any questions or concerns please feel free to contact me or Chip Cox. Thank you for your patience. Diana
