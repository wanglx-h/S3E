Cynthia, I have incorporated Patrick Mackin's revisions per Michelle Cash's instruction. Please review and let me know whether the Q&As are ready for final publication. Your assistance in this regard is greatly appreciated. Thanks, Cole. -----Original Message----- From: Cash, Michelle Sent: Friday, November 16, 2001 12:22 PM To: Brown, Cole Subject: FW: FW: Q&As Cole, here are the revisions to the benefit plan q&a doc. I think these are ready to go if these comments are incorporated -- but check with Barrow on them. On your question about being able to put some of them on the web, let's go through which ones can go and which ones need to be further reviewed. Thanks.
