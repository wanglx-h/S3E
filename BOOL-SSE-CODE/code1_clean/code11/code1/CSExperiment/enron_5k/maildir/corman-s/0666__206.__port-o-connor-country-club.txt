Brad: this is just a test e-mail re Port O'Connor. I have added you to the list now that I have your e-mail. I hope Tim has sent you some of the earlier stuff so you will be up to date. We are trying hard to wrap up the accounting with Marc Deer so we can start conveying individual units. Deer promises to do all the punchlist items. If you have anything that's bugging you, call Marc. You should also be getting by mail a letter from the condo association board about THE RULES, which should give you some flavor for where we stand now. Welcome to the club, I look forward to meeting you and doing some fishing. John Wallace
