We're getting so many great stories that we've extended the deadline for your Enron Business Extreme Enron entries to Wednesday, March 28! Have no idea what we're talking about? Read on( Enron employees are famous for taking risks. Is this an ingrained characteristic? Are we natural-born adrenaline junkies? We think so, but we want to find out from you. If your idea of a good vacation is training for the Eco-Challenge, driving monster trucks or assisting archeological digs in Siberia, tell us all about it. If you know of an employee who has an unusual pastime like missionary work in the Congo, chasing tornadoes or filming sharks, we want to know. Send your entries by email to sarah.palmer@enron.com, by fax to 713-853-6790 or by mail to Sarah Palmer, Enron Public Relations, EB4703D, Houston, Texas 77002. We'll choose our favorite extreme stories and publish them in the next issue of Enron Business. Also, don't forget to check out the current issue -- newly designed -- at http://home.enron.com/pubs/enronbiz/2001/vol1/index.htm
