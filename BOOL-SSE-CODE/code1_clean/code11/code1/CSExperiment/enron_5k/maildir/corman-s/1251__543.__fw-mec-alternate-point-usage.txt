MidAmerican is allowed 50,000 MMBtu/day delivered to alternate delivery points in association with contract 23844. This information was overlooked at the time and since has been evaluated. Please make the necessary corrections so that it is reflected that MEC did not have any alternate point use charges for those months . If you need additional documentation, please let me know. Thanks, Courtney (402) 398-7130
