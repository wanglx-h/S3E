Subject: Re: CAL PX filing
No we don't typically intervene in CTS filings. Alan Comnes 12/28/2000 11:48 AM To: mhain@enron.com cc: smara@enron.com Subject: CAL PX filing I assume we do not want to intervene on this although if we do please note the filing date. CTS I believe is the block forwards portion of the PX. Also this is a compliance filing to an earlier FERC decision. GAC From Janet Butler's weekly summary: California Power Exchange Corporation, ER01-80-000 and ER01-81-000. Revised Tariff Sheets to Amendment to Participation Agreement. On October 10, in Docket No. ER01-80-000, the California Power Exchange Corp. (CalPX), on behalf of its CalPX Trading Services Division (CTS), filed Amendment No. 5 to streamline the Participation Agreement between CTS and its participants. CTS also proposed to clarify that default chargebacks will be billed as administrative fees and proposes a few non-substantive editorial changes. Order issued November 21 accepting CTS, Amendment No. 5 as modified. Order rejects (1) the proposed change to the Assignment provision and directs a compliance filing removing it; and (2) the proposal to incorporate the Information Guide and states to the extent that the Information Guide contains terms and conditions significantly, affecting services or rates, CTS should file to incorporate into the CTS Rate Schedule those portions of the Information Guide that pertain to services and rates. On December 19, CalPX filed revised tariff sheets in compliance with the November 21 order. Filing noticed December 19. Protests due January 4.
