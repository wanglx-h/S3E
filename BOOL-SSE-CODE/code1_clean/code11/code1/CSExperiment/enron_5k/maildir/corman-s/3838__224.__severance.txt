Subject: Severance
Can we use credited service date for sev calc? I have a person who was hired in 1997, left in 1999 and was rehired in April 2001. The system is using a 1998 service date for severance. I calculated in on the 2001 re hire date. Fran Mayes HR Manager Phone (713) 853-7211 Fax (713) 646-8100 Cell/Pager 713 875-3820 or 7138753820@messaging.nextel.com
