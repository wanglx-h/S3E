Subject: Project E2/Endeavor
Dee, I left you a voice mail yesterday, but I wasn't sure if you were in. There is a new deal -- Project E2/Endeavor. It is in the preliminary stages, but the deal team (led by Don Miller) would like to have data regarding the average cost of Enron employee benefits, broken down by type of benefit, if possible. I assume that you would have that type of data and could forward it to Don and me. Let me know if I should be contacting someone else. Thanks a lot!
