Subject: CAISO Notice - Congestion Reform Proposal - Apendix B
Market Participants: As part of the Congestion Management Reform Proposal, the ISO has posted Appendix B "Locational Price Dispersion Study" on the ISO web site at http://www.caiso.com/clientserv/congestionreform.html <http://www.caiso.com/clientserv/congestionreform.html> . Please be aware that the file is very large (the Word version is 5.1 mb and the PDF version is somewhat smaller at 4.3 mb) so it will take a while to download.
