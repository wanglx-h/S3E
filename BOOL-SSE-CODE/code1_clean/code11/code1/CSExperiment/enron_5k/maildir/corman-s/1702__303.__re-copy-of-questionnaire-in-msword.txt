Subject: RE: copy of questionnaire in MSWord
Thanks. Great point. We discussed but for the group of candidates they have this weekend are mostly from the US and they want to captured this level of detail. A box called "Other" is put at the end to capture those non-US locations. ay -----Original Message----- From: Cash, Michelle Sent: Sat 10/27/2001 5:21 AM To: Yowman, Andrea Cc: Subject: RE: copy of questionnaire in MSWord My one comment relates to the "where are you from" question. We only list states in the US -- what about foreign-born students? It seems like it would be a good idea to list regions of the US, then add Mexico, Canada, Carribbean, UK, Europe, Middle East, Asia, etc. to be more inclusive. What do you think? -----Original Message----- From: Yowman, Andrea Sent: Thu 10/25/2001 9:40 AM To: Cash, Michelle Cc: Subject: copy of questionnaire in MSWord <<AA SuperSaturday Questions.doc>> Andrea Yowman Enron Corp 713-853-1477
