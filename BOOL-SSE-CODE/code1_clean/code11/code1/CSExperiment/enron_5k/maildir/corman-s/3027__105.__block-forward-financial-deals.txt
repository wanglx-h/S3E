Subject: Block Forward Financial Deals
Sir, For the month of August, 2000, we will take 50% of our open Block Forward position financial instead of physical. We would like to make this change because we think the elimination of physical risk will benefit us commercially. Thus for bona fide commercial reasons, we will go financial with 50% of our open Block Forward position. Bob Badeer Manager West Power Trading Enron North America
