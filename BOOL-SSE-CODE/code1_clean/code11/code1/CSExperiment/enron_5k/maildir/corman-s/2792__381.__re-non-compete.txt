Subject: RE: Non-Compete
We are working through that issue this week. Michelle -----Original Message----- From: Doucet, Dawn Sent: Wednesday, December 19, 2001 9:26 AM To: Cash, Michelle Subject: Non-Compete Hey Michelle, Did you guys address the non-compete issue for terminated employees? I have 2 commercial employees who've been told that the non-compete is waived (confidentiality stands). Has anyone at your end prepared anything in writing? Please advise asap. Thanks!
