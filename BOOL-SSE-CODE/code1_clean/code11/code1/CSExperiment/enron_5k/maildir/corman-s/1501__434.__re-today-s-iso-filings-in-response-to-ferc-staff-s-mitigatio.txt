Subject: Re: Today's ISO Filings in Response to FERC Staff's Mitigation	Plan
I recommend that we consider filing a motion for summary rejection of the ISO's proposal on the ground that it is the product of an illegal board seated in violation of FERC's governance orders that is a highly politicized tool of Governor Davis, rather than an independent body. In addition to the legal arguments for dismissal, we could also rebut the ISO's economic and market analysis.
