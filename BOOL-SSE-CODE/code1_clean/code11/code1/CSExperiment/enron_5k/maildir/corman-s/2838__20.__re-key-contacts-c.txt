Subject: RE: Key contacts....c
Jamie; I wanted to exchange crucial phone numbers and contacts with you. If you'll reciprocate with key contacts for Express Pipeline I would appreciate it. If for some reason I am unavailable and you wish to either purchase or sell MW volumes, please feel free to contact Diana Scholtes on (503) 464-3807. Our Pre-Schedule (one day or longer scheduling requirements) phone number is 1-877-464-7779. The two ladies most involved with scheduling loads in the Montana region are Stacy Runswick (503) 464-3747 and Cara Semperger (503) 464-3814. Our 24-Hour Real-Time (less than one day up to the next hour) phone number is 1-800-684-1336 You have my office phone number (503) 464-2270 and my cellular phone number is (503) 701-0295. I do not anticipate you needing anyone's number but my own, nor do I anticipate having to contact anyone but you, but I did want to exchange this information just in case. Once again we appreciate the opportunity to serve your Montana loads, and look forward to working together in the future. John
