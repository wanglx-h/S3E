Upgrade the delineator's to support integration of 31 day charts plus setup a second delineator. - This work was completed on January 18th. 2. Implement calculations within PGAS that will provide a flow-weighted daily breakout of index read PD meters. PGAS was contracted to implement these equations mid December. They are currently 65% complete with the development. Estimate development and testing will be completed mid February and implementation into our system before February business close. 3. Implement express-mail service at the field locations. Currently working to setup an account with the US post office. After this account has been setup, the postal service will need about 4 weeks to print labels. Estimate March as the first month which express mail could be implemented. Kenneth C.
