Subject: Clickathome Q&A as of 11/26
I havn't been able yet to pin down the posted FAQ's; they appear to have been taken off the web site. My recollection is that this answer may have been put in the FAQ's published on the web site. This is what is on livelink and is likely to have been provided as info by HR reps to employees before the bankruptcy. There also is a similar response posted to livelink on 11/19/01. http://edms.livelink.enron.com/ena/llview.exe/ClickatHome_Q&A_as_of_11_26_01.html?func=doc.View&nodeId=14722316&docTitle=ClickatHome+Q%26A+as+of+11%2F26%2F01
