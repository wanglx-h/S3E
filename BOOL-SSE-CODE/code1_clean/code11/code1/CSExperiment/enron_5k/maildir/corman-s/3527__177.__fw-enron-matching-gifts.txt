Diane, I'm assuming that these are not being paid. Michelle, do you have any idea if she could get out of her commitment. I'm assuming that she really isn't liable for the $1,000 match. -----Original Message----- From: Mayes, Fran Sent: Wednesday, December 19, 2001 12:20 PM To: Pieper, Kalen Subject: FW: Enron Matching Gifts Kalen, Can you help me with this answer ? Fran -----Original Message----- From: "Elizabeth Hutchinson" <ekhutchinson@earthlink.net>@ENRON Sent: Wed 12/19/2001 10:21 AM To: Mayes, Fran Cc: Subject: Enron Matching Gifts Hi Fran, I know you must be really bogged down with questions, so my apologies in advance for bugging you, but if you could track down an answer for me it would be much appreciated. I am running the Houston Marathon for the Leukemia Society. I made a fundraising commitment of $2000. I have raised $1000 and have been waiting for the Enron match of $1000 from the matching gifts program. The request was submitted well in advance of the cutoff deadline that was announced via e-mail a few weeks before the layoffs. The Leukemia Society has not yet received the match. If Enron does not come up with the match, I am personally on the hook for this $1000, and in light of the small severance situation, it is going to be really tough for me right now. Do you have any information on whether or not the Enron commitment will be honored as was communicated in the e-mail? Do you have any idea when the funds will be sent to the Leukemia Society? Any information you can provide right now will be much appreciated, so that I can pass it along to the Leukemia Society. Thank you, Elizabeth Hutchinson 281-362-9310
