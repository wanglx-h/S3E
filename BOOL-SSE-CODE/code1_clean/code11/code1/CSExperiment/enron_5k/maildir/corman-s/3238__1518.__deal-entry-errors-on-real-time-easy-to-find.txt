Subject: Deal Entry Errors on Real time easy to find.
Hey Monika, These deals look like they are in, but the transmission deal is in on the wrong day. Please check deal #462392(transmission) 462391(WWP for the 18th). I would also like to remind real time that they should route the deals that they do, this helps to catch errors like these.

I bought MPC tranny from Colstrip to Hot Springs for $4.66. I didn't know whether we do the deal entry or not. I have not done it this time but let me know whether to do ir or not in the future and under what group . Monika
