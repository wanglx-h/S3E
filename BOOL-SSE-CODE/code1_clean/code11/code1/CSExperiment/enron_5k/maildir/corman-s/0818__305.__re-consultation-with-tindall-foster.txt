Money. -----Original Message----- From: Daffin, Margaret Sent: Tuesday, November 27, 2001 12:52 PM To: Cash, Michelle Cc: Knudsen, Sheila A.; Tessandori, Bobbi; Barnard, Marla Subject: Consultation with Tindall & Foster Michelle: I would like to recommend that when the H.R. Representative has an exit interview with a foreign national employee who is being laid off from Enron, that Enron offer them a consultation with Tindall & Foster. This would enable the individual to talk to the attorneys about their individual immigration status and concerns, after they leave Enron's employment. I believe it would also show that we are concerned about them. The approximate cost of this is $150 per hour. Do you see any problems with this? Please advise Margaret
