Dear Microsoft .NET Passport Member: Thank you for using Microsoft .NET Passport. Because Microsoft recognizes the importance of security and reliability when using Internet software, we have now made available free browser security upgrades to better protect your online information. We strongly recommend that you check now to see whether your browser needs one of these security upgrades by going to: http://securitycheck.passport.com/default.asp . ADDITIONAL INFORMATION You can read more about these browser security issues at: http://www.microsoft.com/technet/treeview/default.asp?url=/technet/security/bulletin/MS01-055.asp . For more information about recommended online security practices, go to: http://www.microsoft.com/privacy/safeinternet/security/best_practices/default.htm . IF CLICKING A LINK DOESN'T WORK... Copy it, and then paste it into your browser's address bar.
