Subject: DISCUSSION NOTES
Group, Once again we are having issues with a lack of detail in the day and night discussion notes. Anytime there is a cut, whether you think it is insignificant or not, it must be mentioned in your note at the end of your shift. This is true for any schedule that EPMI is involved in......EPE, preschedules, RT schedules. Since all these schedules are now tagged, it would be helpful to mention the tag number in your note as well. In general, the notes have been too brief and lack the detail that is necessary to resolve any after that fact. Let's take the time to do them right and make everyone else's life a bit easier. Thanks, Jesse
