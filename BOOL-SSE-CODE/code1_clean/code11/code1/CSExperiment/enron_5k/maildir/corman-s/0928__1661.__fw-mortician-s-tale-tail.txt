The Mortician's Tale A Portland area mortician had a new apprentice who was learning the embalming ropes. He walked into the embalming room where a cadaver was lying on the table. Thinking he knew enough now to begin the procedure without his boss, he began examining the body. He rolled it over and to his amazement, there was a cork in its rear end. Mystified, he pulled it out, and immediately heard the University of Oregon fight song come out the cadaver's butt. Startled by what had happened, he shoved the cork back into the cadaver and ran up the stairs to find his mentor. "Sir, you've got to come down and help me! I've just seen something I can't believe", he cried. Annoyed by the naivet, of his assistant, he followed him downstairs. "There! Look at the cork in the ass of that body", said the assistant. "I couldn't imagine what it was doing there so I pulled it out. Please, you do it." The mortician was a bit surprised to see the cork too, so he walked to the table and removed the cork. Once again, the University of Oregon fight song started playing. Exasperated, he replaced the cork in its appointed position, turned to his assistant and said: "What's so surprising about that? I've heard thousands of assholes sing that song." Obviously A Beaver Believer
