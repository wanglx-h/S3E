Subject: TICG - Updated General Provisions of RTO West Tariff Working
 Document (3/21/2001)
Hello, members of the RTO West Stage 2 Tariff Integration Group. ? Attached for your entertainment and other use is the RTO West Tariff "working document" as we put it together today at the Tariff Integration Group meeting (just the sections relating to Part I - General Service Provisions).? The only thing?I added after the meeting was pro forma tariff language on load shedding and curtailment?(because I didn't want to take the time to incorporate such a long provision during the meeting). ? I am sending this out now in case you want to review it, but next week I will send out a more fully developed working document with other materials incorporated, as well as an updated "work tracking document." ? Please remember that our next meeting will be on Wednesday, April 4 from 7:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. at the RTO West office. ? We have also scheduled a conference call just to talk about ADR for Friday, March 30 from 9:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Pacific Time.? I will send an e-mail with call-in arrangements after I have made them. ? Thank you very much! ? - Sarah - TIGR - March 21 Meeting Working Document Common Service Provisions.doc
