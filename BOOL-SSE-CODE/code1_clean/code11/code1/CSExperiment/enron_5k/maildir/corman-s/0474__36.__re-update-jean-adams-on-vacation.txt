If air travel hasn't been restored, I expect this other "Directing Green" to rent a car and head southeast! -----Original Message----- From: Forbish, Sherry Sent: Wednesday, September 12, 2001 2:02 PM To: Cara Vaughan (E-mail); Chris Greaney; Debra Scurlock; Harry Woodson; Janet McDaniel; Jean Adams; Joe Linhart; Kathy Sturr; Randy Janzen; Robert Benningfield; Scott Hibbard; Sherry Forbish Cc: Kowalke, Terry; Buchanan, John; Zadow, Raetta; Berger, Larry Subject: Update -- Jean Adams on vacation Jean sent an e-mail reporting they are fine and expect to debark in Vancouver on Saturday. Hopefully air travel and normalcy (as much as possible) will have been restored by then. She will keep us posted. Any questions, please advise--thanks!
