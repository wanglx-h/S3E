Mike/Steve - we have verified all of the volume information and our numbers are correct. Their numbers do not include prior period adjustments in the correct production month and our PVR volumes are correct and agree with the worksheets that they sent us even though they didn't use the correct volumes for the PVR on their worksheets. We still cannot figure out how they got to the amounts that they invoiced us. Please let me know if we are going to go back to those months that we underbilled them so that NNG can recoup that money. If you have any questions, let me know. Thanks, Raetta
