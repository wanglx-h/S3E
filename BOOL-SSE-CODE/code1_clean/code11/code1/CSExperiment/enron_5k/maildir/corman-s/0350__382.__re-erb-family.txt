Thanks! Saturday was great. Yesterday was not a banner day for me. I just kept having feelings of remorse and then guilt that I was feeling remorse. You're probably the only person that can understand how I'm feeling. Talk to you tonight. If you and Chad are gone to Karate before we get home -- we'll go to the store and have dinner ready. -----Original Message----- From: Erb, Kim [mailto:KErb@houston.deepwater.com] Sent: Monday, January 14, 2002 9:02 AM To: Shelley Corman (E-mail) Subject: Erb Family Q, I've confirmed that all four of us are covered under the TSF health plan as of 1/1/02. Furthermore, inoculations are covered 100%, so you should only pay the $10.00 co-pay. Love Kim
