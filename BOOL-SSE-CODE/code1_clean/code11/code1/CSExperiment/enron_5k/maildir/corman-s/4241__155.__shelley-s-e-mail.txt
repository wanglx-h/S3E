Please see Shelley's e-mail address below!!!! Thank you, Ricki -----Original Message----- From: Corman, Shelley Sent: Sunday, December 16, 2001 11:32 PM To: McFarland, Jean Cc: Winters, Ricki Subject: RE: email Jean, I am in Almaty. It looks like a winter wonderland -- something out of Dr. Zhivago. I can''t get my laptop to connect - so I am using the hotel computer. Please advise my team and Ricki to send messages to compuserve address cormanerb@cs.com <mailto:cormanerb@cs.com> as it is much easier/faster to access than Enron mailman. Also could you ask Lynn to temporarily have me removed from all the gas logistics daily phone and email update/weekend update messages.
