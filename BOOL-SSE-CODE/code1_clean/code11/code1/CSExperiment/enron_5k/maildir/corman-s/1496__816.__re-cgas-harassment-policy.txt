Subject: Re: CGAS Harassment Policy
Dave, Is this the proposed, revised policy that OLER is working on? The reason I ask is that OLER is revising all Enron policies right now, and I think that the harassment prevention policy is being revised as well. I'd just as soon we use the latest and greatest instead of the one that is soon to be replaced. Check with Valeria Hope or Susan Tosoni about the status. Thanks. Michelle Enron North America Corp.
