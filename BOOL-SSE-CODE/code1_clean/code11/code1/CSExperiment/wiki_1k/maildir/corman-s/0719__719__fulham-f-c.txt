It was built 100 years ago. It has a pretty building in one corner of the pitch, this is the "Cottage". The fans of Fulham like to call it "The Cottage", and it can have 27,000 people sitting in it. From 2002 to 2004, Fulham had to play at Loftus Road, which is the ground of Queens Park Rangers F.C., near the BBC headquarters. This was because the club needed to renovate Craven Cottage because of new rules. The rules said that nobody can stand at football games, so the club had to install new seats. Some people who live near to Craven Cottage do not like having a big club near to them. They made it hard for the club to be allowed to make the changes. This is why the changes took a long time, even though it was easy work for the builders. Because of the "Cottage", the club and its supporters are called "The Cottagers". == League position by season == {| class="wikitable" style="text-align:left;" |align="center"|Season||align="center"|League||align="center"|Position |- |2000/01||Football League Championship||1st (Promoted) |- |2001/02||English Premier League||13th |- |2002/03||English Premier League||14th |- |2003/04||English Premier League||9th |- |2004/05||English Premier League||13th |- |2005/06||English Premier League||12th |- |2006/07||English Premier League||16th |- |2007/08||English Premier League||17th |- |2008/09||English Premier League||7th |- |2009/10 |Premier League |12th |- |2010/11 |Premier League |8th |- |2011-12 |Premier League |9th |- |2012-13 Premier League |Premier League |12th |- |2013-14 Premier League |Premier League |19th (Relegated) |- |2014-15 |Football League Championship |17th |- |2015-16 |Championship |20th |- |2016-17 Football League Championship |Championship |6th |- |2017–18 EFL Championship |Championship |3rd (Promoted) |- |2018–19 Premier League |Premier League |19th (Relegated) |} === Former position === == Other websites == * [http://www.fulhamfc.com/ Fulham Website] * [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/f/fulham/default.stm News about Fulham from the BBC] (BBC) * [http://images.google.com/images?svnum=10&q=Craven+Cottage&btnG=Search Pictures of Craven Cottage] * [http://www.homesoffootball.co.uk/0259_FULHAM.JPG The outside of Craven Cottage] Category:Premier League clubs Category:1879 establishments in England
