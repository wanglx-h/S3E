It was designed for Linux, but many other operating systems can use it too. GNOME aims to provide an easy way to use a computer. GNOME is a free software project. It was made because people were questioning whether KDE is free. GNOME is part of the GNU project. == Aims == According to the GNOME website: }} The GNOME project puts heavy emphasis on simplicity, usability, and making things “just work” (see ''KISS principle''). The other aims of the project are: * Freedom—to create a desktop environment with readily-available source code for re-use under a free software license. * Computer accessibility—to ensure the desktop can be used by anyone, regardless of technical skill or physical circumstances. * Internationalization and localization—to make the desktop available in many languages. At the moment, GNOME is being translated to 161 languages. * Developer-friendliness—to ensure ease of writing software that integrates smoothly with the desktop, and allow developers a free choice of programming language. * Organization—to adhere to a regular release cycle and maintain a disciplined community structure. * Support—to ensure backing from other institutions beyond the GNOME community. == Applications == GNOME has many applications written for it. Some of them include: * Abiword - A word processor, used for writing wikt:documents * Calculator - For doing maths * Epiphany (software) - Internet browser * Empathy - Internet Instant messaging * Ekiga - VoIP and video conferencing * Eye of GNOME - View your picture files * Gthumb - View your photos * GIMP - Art and photo software * Nautilus (file manager) - File manager * Totem - Play music and video ==Related pages== * Ubuntu Linux ==References== == Other websites == *[http://www.gnome.org The GNOME website] *[http://www.gnomedesktop.org News about GNOME] Category:GNOME Category:Linux Category:Desktop Environments
