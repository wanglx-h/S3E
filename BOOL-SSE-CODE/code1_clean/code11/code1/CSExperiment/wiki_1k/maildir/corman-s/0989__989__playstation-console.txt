At the time, it was competing against the Nintendo 64 and the Sega Saturn. PlayStation games were stored on CD-ROMs. The controllers that were first released with the console had no analog signal joysticks on them, but analog joysticks and a vibration feature were added to later controllers. A slimmer version of the console called the ''PS One'' was released in 2000. It was white instead of grey. It was succeeded by the PlayStation 2 in March 2000 and was discontinued on March 23, 2006 (eight months before the PlayStation 3 was released). ==History== The PlayStation was created by Ken Kutaragi, a Sony executive who managed a engineering division and was later nicknamed "the Father of the PlayStation". The PlayStation was released in 1994 in Japan and 1995 in North America and Europe ==Sales== The '''PlayStation''' and the PSOne have sold over 120 million consoles.

It had a clock, an LCD display and four buttons. It could be used as a memory card. It wasn't released in the United States, because it did not sell well. ==References== Category:PlayStation (brand)
