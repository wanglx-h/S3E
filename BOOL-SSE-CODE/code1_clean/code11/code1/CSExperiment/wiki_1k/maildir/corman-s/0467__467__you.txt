'''You''' is a grammatical person English language pronoun. The word can be singular or plural. It is what a person says when he or she is addressing another person in second person. Sometimes, just using the English language letter "u" is acceptable, and "ur" for the words "you're" and "your". This is very informal, and is mostly used in texting.
