The term also excludes Hong Kong and Macau. In the Qing Dynasty (Manchu Dynasty), all of Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Kinmen, Matsu, the Pescadores, and Mongolia were part of the Manchu Empire. Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau were colonized by foreigners for some years (Taiwan to the Japanese, Hong Kong to the UK, and Macau to the Portugal). By the end the Qing Empire, China became Kuomintang China (the Republic of China) and it got Taiwan back in 1945. After the Communists (the People's Republic of China) took over most of China, the Nationalists kept only Taiwan, Kinmen, Matsu, and the Pescadores. Mongolia became an independence state later. Since then, Communist China only includes the part on the continent (mainland) and some small islands that are very near (the largest communist island is Hainan). This region is Mainland China. Later Hong Kong and Macau were returned to the government of China, but because the government calls them "Special administrative regions of China" under a "one country, two systems" idea, they are still not thought of as part of Mainland China.
