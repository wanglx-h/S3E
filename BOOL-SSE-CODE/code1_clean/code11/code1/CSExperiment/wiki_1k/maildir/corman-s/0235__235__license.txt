A '''license''' (in American English) or '''licence''' (in British English) allows someone to do something that they otherwise are not allowed to do.

A license is usually written but it does not have to be. Most kinds of licenses can only be used by the person they were given to. Licenses may be temporary or permanent. Some licenses can not be taken away once they are given. A person with a license is called a '''licensee'''. In many countries, if a person tries to do something without the correct license to do it, they might have to pay a fine or go to prison. ==Examples of licenses== There are many different types of licenses. ===Driver's license=== The laws of most country say that people are only allowed to drive cars if they have a driver's license. If a person does not have a license, they may have to pay a fine if they are caught by the police. In many countries, a person must take a test and pay money to get a license. The test would check that they know the road rules, and have the skill to drive a car. ===Hunting license=== Other licenses give permission to shoot animals (often called a hunting license). The hunting license usually says when a person may hunt. A hunter may have to pass a test to show that they understand the rules about hunting.

A person or a company can give a license to a copyright that they own. So in order for another person to use an owner's copyright they need permission from the owner. For example, when someone buys computer software, they also need a license from the creator of the software (a copyright owner) allowing the buyer to use the software. == Difference between license and licence == "License" is a verb and "licence" is a noun. "Licensing sessions" were the meetings of magistrates which decided about giving licences to sell Alcoholic drink. In American English there is no difference in spelling between the verb "to license" meaning to give permission, and the noun "a license" meaning the permission to do something. == Distinction between a licence and a qualification == A degree in medicine is a qualification showing a person has successfully studied medicine.
