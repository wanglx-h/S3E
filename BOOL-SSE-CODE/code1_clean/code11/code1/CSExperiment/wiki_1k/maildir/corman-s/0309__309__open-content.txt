File:CC-logo.svg are one of the most widely used open content licenses.]] '''Open content''' is content that is openly accessible, usable, editable, and distributable by anyone for any purpose, even commercially. Open content is licensed with an open license that authorizes use of the content as described above. When someone creates something (like a picture or book), they can open it for the use of others. This means that other people are allowed to copy it and change it if they want. Something that is open content may be wikt:free of charge, but it does not have to be. The Simple English Wikipedia is open content, and so are other Wikipedias. If a person changes open content or makes new open content, everyone can give it to anyone else, or even sell it. == License == The rules that say how people can use, change and pass around open content are called a license. A license explains exactly what you are allowed to do with the content that falls under it. Licenses are often written in difficult language (legal jargon), but many licenses have Summary that are much easier to understand. The makers of open content get to choose what license to use for their work, and everyone else has to follow it. Only the maker, who owns the copyright, can change it to another license. Most open content licenses say that when others change the work, they must also declare it to be open and under the same license. This is called ''share-alike'' and means that anything based on work will always be open content. All the content in Wikipedia is open under the rules of the Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License, a very well-known open content license. Another well-known open content license is the Wikipedia:Simple_English_GFDL. == Related pages == * Open educational resource * Open data * Openness == References == == Other websites == * [https://wordpress.org/openverse Openverse], search engine for finding open content Category:Art Category:Open content
