File:Colchester Castle.jpg '''Colchester''' is a city in the northern part of the England Counties of England of Essex. It has a population of 130,245 people. People believe that Colchester is the oldest Ancient Rome town in England. == History == Before Roman times, Colchester was ''Camulodunon''. This is a Celtic languages name that came from Camulos. Camulos was the Celtic deity of war. The Romans called Colchester ''Camulodunum'' (written "CAMVLODVNVM") and made it the capital of Roman Britain. Colchester was attacked and burnt by Boudicca in 61 AD. The Romans moved their capital of Britannia to Londinium (now London), but Camulodunum remained an important city until the fifth century, when the Saxons conquered the region.

(1994) Late Roman Colchester, In Oxford Journal of Archaeology 13(1) It may have reached a population of 30,000 in those centuries, but when the Romans withdrew from Britannia in 410 AD it probably had fewer than 5,000 inhabitants.B. D'Ambrosio. "Roman Camulodunum". University of Genova ( [https://6612springbottomway.blogspot.com/2019/10/a-roman-colony-in-britannia-camulodunum.html]) The church at the Benedictine abbey of John the Baptist was destroyed in 1539. This action was part of the dissolution of the monasteries by King Henry VIII. Only a gate remains, that people still go to visit. King Cunobelinus (or "Cunobelin") was from Colchester. Until 2022, Colchester was officially a town, not a city. On 5 September, Queen Elizabeth II signed letters patent to grant it City status in the United Kingdom. This was planned as part of Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II celebrations. However, she died three days later. On 29 September, these letters were publicly released. == Twin cities == Colchester is sister city with the following cities: * Imola, Italy * Wetzlar, Germany * Avignon, France ==Notes== ==Bibliography== * B D'Ambrosio.
