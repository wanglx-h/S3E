It contained 40,000 Japanese soldiers within the city's limit, and was a beehive (or center) of war industry. The industry manufactured parts for planes and boats, bombs, rifles, and handguns. Children also were shown how to construct and throw gasoline bombs. and the heavy sick were assembling traps to be planted in the beaches of Kyushu.[http://www.ourcivilisation.com/smartboard/shop/tomwitts/active/chap7.htm 7. Activation (September 1, 1944 — June 27, 1945) From 'Ruin From The Air' by Gordon Thomas & Max Morgan Witts] As with other Japanese cities, many of the strategic targets in Hiroshima were mixed with civilian homes and centers made of wood and paper. This made it harder to conduct a successful precision attack. And the highly inaccuracy of the bombing technology in World War II was owed to it. As a result, the city became the first nuclear weapon used against a target in history.BBC, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/6/newsid_3602000/3602189.stm"1945: US drops atomic bomb on Hiroshima"]; retrieved 2012-3-3.

Another 70,000 were injured.[https://www.osti.gov/opennet/manhattan-project-history/Events/1945/hiroshima.htm THE ATOMIC BOMBING OF HIROSHIMA] The bomb was nicknamed ''Little Boy'' after President Theodore Roosevelt. A building near the blast center still remains and is called the Atomic Bomb Dome. === Itsukushima shrine === Near to Hiroshima, there is a small island called Miyajima. The island is known for its deer. An old Shinto shrine named Itsukushima Shrine is also here. It is said that Itsukushima shrine was built at the end of the 5th century. The shrine is known for its use of red-colored wood, and especially for the ''torii'' gate. The gate leads into the shrine, which is partly underwater at high tide. Today, Itsukushima shrine and the Atomic Bomb Dome are registered as World Heritage Site. Also it was a landing site for the U.S. ==Related pages== * Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki * Sanfrecce Hiroshima * List of World Heritage Sites in Japan * Hiroshima Toyo Carp == References == == Other websites == * [http://ww2db.com/battle_spec.php?battle_id=49 WW2DB: Destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki] Category:Hiroshima Category:World Heritage Sites in Japan
