Its nearest neighbour is Kiribati, east. Nauru is the smallest island nation, covering just , the smallest republic, and the only republican state without a Capital city. With 10,670 residents, it is the third List of countries by population after Vatican City and Tuvalu. Nauru is a phosphate rock island, and its main export since 1907 has been phosphate. English language and Nauruan language are the official languages. The president is David Adeang. == Geography == File:Aerial view of Nauru.jpg Nauru is a oval-shaped island in the southwestern Pacific Ocean, south of the equator. The island is surrounded by a coral reef, which can be seen during low tide. Because of this, a harbor can not be built. Canal let small boats get to the island. An area of ground where plants can easily grow wide lies inland from the beach. Coral cliffs surround Nauru's plateau (highland). The highest point, the Command Ridge, is above sea level. The only fertile areas are on the coastal belt, where coconut palms flourish. The land surrounding Buada Lagoon supports bananas, pineapples, vegetables, Pandanus tectorius, and hardwoods such as the Calophyllum inophyllum. Nauru was one of three great guano (bird droppings) islands in the Pacific Ocean (the others were Banaba (Ocean Island) in Kiribati and Makatea in French Polynesia). The phosphate reserves on Nauru are now almost used up. Phosphate mining in the plateau has left a bare area of land with limestone peaks up to high. Mining has stripped and destroyed about 80per cent of Nauru's land, and has affected the surrounding Exclusive Economic Zone. About 40per cent of marine life has been killed by mud and phosphate drainage. There are only about 60 Native (ecology) vascular plant species on the island. Coconut farming, mining, and introduced species have damaged the island's native vegetation. There are no native land mammals, but there are native insects, land crabs, and birds, including the Nauru Reed Warbler. The Polynesian rat, cats, dogs, pigs, and chickens have been introduced to Nauru from ships. There are only a few fresh water sources on Nauru. Storage tanks collect rainwater, but the islanders usually have to rely on Desalination at Nauru's Utilities Agency. The island's biggest problems are climate change and rising sea levels. Nauru is the seventh most global warming threatened nation due to flooding. At least 80per cent of the land of Nauru is well elevated, but this area will be uninhabitable until the phosphate mining improvement programme is started == Climate == Nauru's climate is hot and very humid year-round because of how close it is to the equator and the ocean. Nauru is hit by monsoon rains between November and February, but does not usually have Cyclone. How much rain there is every year is highly variable, and is influenced by the El Niño-Southern Oscillation. There have been many Drought in Nauru because of this. The temperature on Nauru ranges between and during the day, and between and at night. == Administrative divisions == Nauru is divided into fourteen administrative districts.
