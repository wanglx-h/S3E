Subject: Suggestion
A '''suggestion''' is an idea that one suggests, or says is goodness for another (or others) to follow. Some people may agree to it, and some may disagree. If they disagree or have a different suggestion, the person who first suggested the idea will usually discuss with the other people and find a good conclusion that satisfies both and is good. A suggestion is someone's opinion on how to do any task, but a person is not necessarily expected to do it. == References == Category:Basic English 850 words
