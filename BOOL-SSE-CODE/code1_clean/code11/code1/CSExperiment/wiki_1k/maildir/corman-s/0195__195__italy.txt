Rome was founded in 753 BC. It was a separate state well known as Roman Kingdom firstly, Roman Republic and Roman Empire later. It conquered various neighbors including the Etruscan civilization in the north and the states in the south known as Magna Graecia. Before 1861, Italy was not a state. The area included a group of separate states that were ruled by other countries (such as Austria, France, and Spain). In the 1850s, the Earl of Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour was the head of government of the "State of Sardinia". He talked to the Austrians in Lombardy and Veneto and said they should create a Northern Italian state. This happened, but other Central and Southern Italian states also joined Piedmont to create a bigger state. === Kingdom of Italy === In 1860, Giuseppe Garibaldi took control of Sicily, creating the Kingdom of Italy in 1861. Victor Emmanuel II of Italy was made the king. In 1861, Latium and Veneto were still not part of Italy, because they were ruled by the Pope and Austrian Empire. Veneto was made part of Italy in 1866 after a war with Austria. Italian soldiers won Latium in 1870. That was when they took away the Pope's power. The Pope, who was angry, said that he was a prisoner to keep Catholicism people from being active in politics. That was the year of Italian unification. Italy participated in World War I. It was an ally of Great Britain, France, and Russia against the Central Powers. Almost all of Italy's fighting was on the Eastern border, near Austria. After the "Caporetto defeat", Italy thought they would lose the war. But, in 1918, the Central Powers Surrender (military). Italy gained the Trentino-South Tyrol, which once was owned by Austria. === Fascist Italy === In 1922, a new Italian government started. It was ruled by Benito Mussolini, the leader of Fascism in Italy. He became head of government and dictator, calling himself "Il Duce" (which means "leader" in Italian language). He became friends with German dictator Adolf Hitler. Nazi Germany, Empire of Japan, and Italy entered the Axis Powers. In 1940, they entered World War II together against France, Great Britain, and later the Soviet Union. During the war, Italy controlled most of the Mediterranean Sea. On July 25, 1943, Mussolini was removed by the Great Council of Fascism. On September 8, 1943, Badoglio said that the war as an ally of Germany was ended. Italy started fighting as an ally of France and the UK, but Italian soldiers did not know whom to shoot. In Northern Italy, a movement called Italian resistance movement started to fight against the German invasion. On April 25, 1945, much of Italy became free, while Mussolini tried to make a small Northern Italian Fascism state called the Republic of Salò. The fascist state failed and Mussolini tried to flee to Switzerland and escape to Francisco Franco, but he was captured by Italian partisans. On 28 April 1945 Mussolini was executed by a partisan. === After World War Two === The state became a :en:Republic on June 2, 1946. For the first time, women were able to vote. The Italian people ended the Savoia dynasty and adopted a republican form of government. In February of 1947, Italy signed a peace treaty with the Allies of World War II. They lost all the colonies and some territorial areas (Istria and parts of Dalmatia). Since then Italy has joined NATO and the European Community (as a founding member). It is one of the seven biggest industrial economies in the world. == Transportation == File:Rom Fiumicino 2011-by-RaBoe-02.jpg was the List of the busiest airports in Europe in Europe in 2008.]] The Rail transport transport network in Italy totals .
