'''Mythology''' is the collection of myths for a culture. A myth is a story or series of stories used to explain the world around you and describe what is happening, such as why weather happens. Myths usually have heroes, gods, and creatures that are bigger or more fantastic than real life, or sometimes just normal people doing amazing things. Some myths try to explain the natural world. One example is the Greek mythology myth of Arachne. She believed that she could weave far better than anyone else, including the goddess Athena. So, Athena challenged Arachne to a weaving contest. Arachne lost, then was turned into a spider. This myth explains why spiders weave webs. == A few mythologies == * Hindu mythology * Roman mythology * Greek mythology * Manipuri mythology (Meitei mythology) * Norse mythology * Japanese mythology * Anglo-Saxon mythology * Etruscan mythology * Chinese mythology * Māori mythology#:~:text=Māori mythology and Māori traditions are two major,folkloric legends often involving historical or semi * Native American mythology * Australian Aboriginal mythology * Celtic mythology * :en:Iranian_mythology * :en:Korean_mythology * Slavic mythology * Armenian mythology * African mythology * Polynesian mythology * Inuit * Babylonia * Sumer * Egyptian mythology * :en:Maya_mythology * Aztec mythology * :en:Inca_mythology * Philippines == Related pages == * Myth Category:Mythology
