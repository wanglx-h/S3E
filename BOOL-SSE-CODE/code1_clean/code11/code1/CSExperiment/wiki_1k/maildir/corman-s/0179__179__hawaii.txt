It is the most recent state to join the United States, becoming a state on August 21, 1959. It is the only state made only of islands. Hawaii is also the name of the largest island. The Capital (city) and largest city of Hawaii is Honolulu, Hawaii on the island named Oahu. ==Name== Hawaii is known as the "Aloha State". ''Aloha'' is a Hawaiian language word that has many meanings like welcome, hello and goodbye. Aloha also means love and care. The different meanings are brought together in the term "Aloha Spirit" to describe the friendly people of Hawaii. ==Geography== Hawaii is an archipelago, a long chain of islands. There are eight main islands and many small islands and atolls. They are the tops of underwater volcanos. The main islands are Niihau, Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Lanai, Kahoolawe, Maui and Hawaii (island). ==History== The first people of Hawaii were Polynesians. They came to the islands sometime between 200 and 600 AD. Captain James Cook discovered the islands in 1778. Others may have been there before him. Captain Cook named the islands the Sandwich Islands for the fourth Earl of Sandwich, John Montague. Kamehameha I was the first king of Hawaii. He united the separate small Hawaiian kingdoms into one large kingdom in 1795. In 1893, American soldiers stopped Queen Liliuokalani from leading Hawaii when American business people took over the government and made their own laws. She was the last monarch of Hawaii. She also wrote the original words of the song called ''Aloha Oe''. The Americans made Hawaii into a republic for a short time. The new leader, Sanford Dole was called the President of Hawaii. In 1898, the United States of America took over the government and made Hawaii into a territory.In 1907, University of Hawaiʻi is established. In 1959, Hawaii became the fiftieth American state. In other words, it was taken ("annexed") against the wishes of its native people. Their queen, Lili’uokalani, wrote that “it had not entered into our hearts to believe that these friends and allies from the United States... would ever go so far as to absolutely overthrow our form of government, seize our nation by the throat, and pass it over to an alien power”. === Reason for statehood === Early in World War II the U.S. Pacific Fleet was based on the Philippines. Perceiving that this was not safe, the navy moved its base to the Hawaiian islands, namely Oahu (the main island in the chain). It was there that the Japanese attacked Joint Base Pearl Harbor–Hickam. That was significant in the later discussions about the future of the islands. ==Economy== The biggest industry of Hawaii is tourism. Almost seven million people visited in 2000. Important exports are sugar, pineapple, macadamia nuts, and coffee. Popular tourist sites include Waikiki Beach, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, Polynesian Cultural Center, and the USS Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor. ==State symbols== The state flower is the yellow hibiscus (''Hibiscus brackenridgei'' or ). The state bird is the Nene (nene). The state fish is the reef triggerfish, also called the ''''. The state tree is the candlenut, also called ''kukui''. The state song is Hawaii Ponoi. The state motto is ''''. In English it says, ''The life of the land is perpetuated in righteousness''. ==References== '''Notes''' ==Other websites== Category:Hawaii Category:1959 establishments in the United States
