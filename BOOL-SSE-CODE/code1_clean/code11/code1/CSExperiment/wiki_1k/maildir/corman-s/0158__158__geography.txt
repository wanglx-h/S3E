Its features are things like continents, seas, rivers and mountains. Its inhabitants are all the people and animals that live on it. Its phenomena are the things that happen like tides, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes and more. A person who is an expert in geography is a geographer. A geographer tries to understand the world and the things that are in it, how they started and how they have changed.Geography: The Mother of Sciences [http://web.clas.ufl.edu/users/morgans/lecture_2.prn.pdf] [https://web.archive.org/web/20081003084542/http://web.clas.ufl.edu/users/morgans/lecture_2.prn.pdf] Geography is divided into two main parts which are: Physical geography and human geography. Physical geography studies the natural environment and human geography studies the human environment. The human environmental studies would include things such as the population in a country, how a country's economy is doing, and more. There is also environmental geography. Maps are a main tool of geography, so geographers spend much time making and studying them. Making maps is called cartography, and people who specialize in making maps are cartographers. == Branches == === Physical geography === Physical geography (or physiography) focuses on geography as an Earth science. It aims to understand the physical problems and the issues of lithosphere, hydrosphere, Earth's atmosphere, pedosphere, and global flora and fauna patterns (biosphere). '''Physical geography can be divided into many broad categories, including:''' :{| style="border:1px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin: auto;" cellspacing="15" | File:Línea de Wallace.jpg || File:Cyclone Catarina from the ISS on March 26 2004.JPG || File:90 mile beach.jpg || File:Gavin Plant.JPG |- | Biogeography || Climatology & Meteorology || Coastal geography || Environmental management |- | File:Meridian convergence and spehrical excess.png || File:Delicate Arch LaSalle.jpg || File:Receding glacier-en.svg ||File:Meander.svg |- | Geodesy || Geomorphology || Glaciology || Hydrology & Hydrography |- | File:Khajuraho-landscape.jpg || File:World11.jpg || File:Soil profile.jpg || File:Pangea animation 03.gif |- | Landscape ecology || Oceanography || Pedology (soil study) || Palaeogeography |- | File:Milankovitch Variations sv.png | | | |- | Quaternary science | | | |} === Human geography === File:Menschentraube.jpg '''Human geography''' is the Social sciences that covers the study of people and their communities, cultures, economies and their interaction with the environment. Geographer studying the human environment may look at: * Population * Country * Land use * Agriculture * City * Industry * Energy * Pollution ==History== The oldest known world map dates back to ancient Babylon from the 9th century BC. The best known Babylonian world map is the ''Imago Mundi'' of 600 BC. Star charts (maps of the sky) are of similar age. During the Middle Ages, people in Europe made fewer maps. People in the eastern countries made more. Abū Zayd al-Balkhī created the "Balkhī school" of mapping in Baghdad. Western Europe became known as the leader of geographic thought during the European Renaissance and Age of Exploration (1400–1600). The printing press made maps and information about the world available to everyone. In 1650, the first edition of ''Geographia Generalis'' was published. In the 1700s and 1800s scientists started to study the relationship between the environment and its people Related pages * Geodesy * Geographer * Geographical renaming * Geopolitics * International Geographical Union * Landform * Map * Navigator * Political geography == References == == Other websites == * [http://www.dinksoftware.com Geography Trainer 1.3 - Educational game aimed at school children] * [http://www.geoknow.net www.geoknow.net - Geography resources at your fingertips!] * [http://www.populationdata.net PopulationData.net] * [http://www.populationmondiale.com PopulationMondiale.com] * [http://www.ericdigests.org/1996-4/high.htm Using Literature To Teach Geography in High Schools.
