Unlike most computers, it has a computer system with the screen inside it.]] The '''Apple Macintosh''' or just '''Mac''' is a line of personal computers made by the American company Apple Inc.. The Macintosh was one of the first computers in which the people could use a mouse for pointing on a screen which had icons. This new way of working with a computer (interface) was known as graphical user interfaces and consoles. It was this feature of the Macintosh that made it so popular. == History == === Processor history === The '''Apple–Intel transition''' was when Apple changed the CPU of Macintosh computers from PowerPC processors to Intel x86 processors. It was announced at the 2005 World Wide Developers Conference. Steve Jobs announced it. Macintoshes were different than other personal computers for many years based on their central processing unit (CPU). At the start, Macs used Motorola 68000 chips instead of Intel chips. Later, Macs used PowerPC chips. In 2006, Macs started to use Intel chips. In 2020, Macs started to use Apple Silicon chips. Today, Macs are sold with Apple M1 chips. == Macintoshes == {| class="wikitable" |- | || '''Compact''' (portable) || '''Consumer''' (wikt:end user) || '''Professional''' |- | '''Desktop''' || Mac Mini || iMac || Mac Pro; Mac Studio |- | '''Portable''' (MacBook) || MacBook || MacBook Air || MacBook Pro |- | '''Server''' || Mac Mini (server) || Mac Mini (server) || Mac Pro (server) |} === Software === The Mac does not have the Microsoft Windows operating system installed on it.
