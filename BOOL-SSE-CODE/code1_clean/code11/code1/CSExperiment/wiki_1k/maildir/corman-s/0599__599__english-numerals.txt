The way numbers are written and spoken differs between American English and other forms of English, such as British English and Australian English, as follows. == American English == To write a whole number from 100 to 999 in American English: * First write how many hundreds. * Then write the word "hundred". * Then write the name of the two-digit number after the digit in the hundreds place. In standard, written, American English, the word "and" is ''not'' in the word-name of any whole number even though many speakers insert it. Examples: * 101: one hundred one * 102: one hundred two * 175: one hundred seventy-five * 200: two hundred * 300: three hundred * 400: four hundred * 512: five hundred twelve * 513: five hundred thirteen * 600: six hundred * 987: nine hundred eighty-seven == British and Commonwealth English == To write a whole number from 100 to 999 in British and Commonwealth English: * First write how many hundreds. * Then write the words "hundred and". * Then write the name of the two-digit number after the digit in the hundreds place. In standard, written, British English (and the English spoken in many other places), the word "and" ''is'' in the word-name of many whole numbers. Examples: * 101: one hundred and one (NOT: one hundred one) * 102: one hundred and two (NOT: one hundred two) * 175: one hundred and seventy-five (NOT: one hundred seventy-five) * 200: two hundred * 300: three hundred * 400: four hundred * 500: five hundred * 512: five hundred and twelve (NOT: five hundred twelve) * 900: nine hundred * 987: nine hundred and eighty-seven (NOT: nine hundred eighty-seven) ==Related pages== * Names of ordinal numbers in English * Names for large numbers * Names for small numbers Category:Numbers
