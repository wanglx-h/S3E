Switzerland is a federation of 26 Cantons of Switzerland. The official name of Switzerland is ''Confoederatio Helvetica'' ('''Swiss Confederation'''). This is Latin and is not often used except for official state documents. When it was founded in 1291, Switzerland was a confederation, but later became a federation, even though it has kept the word ''Confoederatio'' in its official name. Switzerland does not have an official capital city, but Bern (city) is used as though it is the capital. The largest city of Switzerland is Zürich City. To the north of Switzerland is Germany. East of Switzerland are Austria and Liechtenstein. To the south of Switzerland is Italy. To the west of Switzerland is France. Switzerland is known for its neutrality (international relations). A country is neutral when it does not take sides among the countries who are at war. Switzerland has been neutral since 1815. However, on February 28, 2022 Switzerland joined the imposition of economic sanctions against Russia. Many international organizations are in Switzerland. The United Nations has a main office (but not its headquarters) in Geneva City. Its predecessor organization, the League of Nations, was headquartered in Geneva. == Languages == There are four official languages in Switzerland: German language, French language, Italian language, and Romansh. Some cantons and even towns have two languages spoken in them, and the largest canton by area, Graubünden, has three. About 2/3 of the population speak German; French is spoken in the west of the country, and Italian in the canton of Ticino. The Romansh language is spoken in parts of Graubünden, by less than 1% of the Swiss population. == Geography == File:Matterhornnorth.jpg in the Swiss Alps]] The area of Switzerland is 41,285km². The confederation is divided into 23 full states called ''cantons of Switzerland''. All 26 cantons are: Aargau, Appenzell Innerrhoden, Appenzell Ausserrhoden, Basel-Stadt, Basel-Landschaft, Bern (canton), Fribourg (canton), Geneva (canton), Glarus (canton), Graubünden, Jura (canton), Lucerne, Neuchâtel, Nidwalden, Obwalden, Schaffhausen, Schwyz, Solothurn, St. Gallen, Thurgau, Ticino, Canton of Uri, Valais, Vaud, Zug, and Zürich Canton. The mountains are very tall in the center and south of Switzerland. About 60% of Switzerland is in the Alps area. Few people live there. The highest mountain is the Dufourspitze at 4,634 m. Many of the mountains have ice all year. This ice is called glaciers. The rivers Rhine, Rhône, and many other rivers start in the mountains of Switzerland. There are many lakes in Switzerland. The biggest lakes are all in the north and west: Lake Geneva (''Lac Léman''), Lake Zürich, Lake Neuchâtel and Lake Constance (''Bodensee''). Mountains in the north of Switzerland are fewer and smaller. Most Swiss people live in cities and towns in the north. The Jura mountains are in the northwest of Switzerland. === Cities === File:Distrib citta svizzera.png Switzerland has 2,485 villages, towns and cities. The largest cities are: File:Civil Ensign of Switzerland.svg == Culture == File:Alpabfahrt, Mels. 2019-09-14 13-04-59.jpg at Mels in 2019]] There are about 8.4 million people in Switzerland. About 64% of the people speak Swiss German (German language Alemannic) as their first language, in northern and central Switzerland. 19% of the people speak French language as their first language, mainly in the west of Switzerland. 8% of the people speak Italian language, in the south of Switzerland. Only 1% of the people speak Romansh, in the southeastern part of Switzerland. The first number refers to the share of languages within total population. The second refers to the Swiss citizens only. Romansh is an old language that is similar to Latin. The German-speaking people of Switzerland do not actually speak "German" as their native language. Swiss people speak something called Alemannic German which has its own writing language and grammar but still is normally considered a German dialect. Alemannic may be difficult for Germans to understand. Swiss people do write like the people from Germany and also speak standard German very well, especially in the larger cities. About 23% of the people in Switzerland do not come from Switzerland.[http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/themen/01/22/publ.Document.114724.pdf Ausländerinnen und Ausländer in der Schweiz - Bericht 2008 (German)] (1196 KiB), Swiss Federal Statistical Office, page 12. They come from other places to usually work in Switzerland. The religion of most people in Switzerland is Christianity. 43% of the population follow Catholicism. 35% of the population follow Protestantism. 2% follow Eastern Orthodoxy. The religion of 4% of the population is Islam. The rest follow other religions, or they have no religion. In recent years, many people in Switzerland have left the Catholic or Protestant Church. They may still believe in something, but they no longer want to belong to an official religion or church. Many couples are choose a non-religious (or "free") wedding ceremony outside the church.

They signed a contract to work together called the ''Eternal Alliance''. Together, they could be free from the people of Habsburg, who were very strong. In 1315 the people from the Eternal Alliance fought the Habsburgs in battles at Morgarten, Sempach and Näfels. The people of the Eternal Alliance won all the battles. People from other areas signed the contract and joined the Eternal Alliance. More and more people worked together to be free. In 1648, other countries from Europe made an agreement that Switzerland was free. The name of this agreement was the ''Peace of Westphalia''. More areas came to be part of Switzerland. Switzerland was important to the slave trade that forced Black people Africa to be sold as slaves. Swiss companies made indiennes, which are a kind of cloth. These cloths were sent to Africa and exchanged for captured slaves. Some Swiss also joined French companies already making indiennes or owned plantations with slaves in French colonies. In 1798, France invaded Switzerland. The ruler of France was Napoleon. He changed many laws. In 1815 Switzerland again became independent from France. Other countries agreed at the Congress of Vienna that Switzerland was free and neutral. The constitution of Switzerland that was made after a short civil war in 1848 was replaced in 1999. Switzerland did not fight in World War I or World War II. Since 2002, Switzerland is part of the United Nations. It did not join the United Nations for 57 years because of its neutrality. == Politics == File:Bern luftaufnahme.png is the Swiss Capital.]] Switzerland is a republic. Switzerland does not have the same kind of president as the United States or France. Seven people (called ministers) do the job of president. They are called the Federal Council in English, ''Bundesrat'' in German, ''Conseil Fédéral'' in French, ''Consiglio Federale'' in Italian and ''Cussegl Federal'' in Romansh. Every year one of these people is made president. The president is not more important than the other six people. At present 3 of the 7 people are women. The seven people are: * Alain Berset (President in 2023) * Guy Parmelin * Ignazio Cassis * Viola Amherd (Vice president in 2023) * Karin Keller-Sutter * Albert Rösti * Élisabeth Baume-Schneider There are two parts of parliament in Switzerland. The ''Council of States'' and the ''National Council''. Only both together can make laws. There are 46 people in the Council of States. Every full canton of Switzerland can send 2 people. There are 200 people in the National Council. The biggest canton sends most people to the National Council. The smallest 6 cantons can only send one person to the National Council. The people of Switzerland can collect signatures if they do not like a new law or a law change. This is called a ''referendum''. If enough people sign a referendum, the people vote. The people can also collect signatures to change the constitution. This is called an ''initiative''. The constitution is the basic law of a country. == Economy == Switzerland is not a member of the European Union, but it is member of the European Free Trade Agreement (EFTA). The EFTA makes trade with other countries in Europe easier. In 1999 Switzerland and the European Union made a contract. This contract makes trade even easier. They recently made two other contracts. The banks of Switzerland and the insurance companies in Switzerland together produce eleven per cent of the gross domestic product. Tourism is important in Switzerland. There are many places for tourists. Davos, St. Moritz, Pontresina and Flims are in Switzerland. These towns are important both in winter (for skiing) and in summer. Tourists also like the cities of Lucerne, Geneva City, and Zürich City. In 2011 the Pharmaceutical drug industry in Switzerland directly and indirectly employed about 135,000 people.Stephan Vaterlaus, Stephan Suter and Barbara Fischer, [http://www.interpharma.ch/sites/default/files/polynomics-2011_bedeutung-der-pharmaindustrie-fuer-die-schweiz_e.pdf "The Importance of the Pharmaceutical Industry for Switzerland"] , A study undertaken on behalf of Interpharma, September 2011. The companies Novartis and Hoffmann-La Roche are the second and third largest pharma companies in the world. They both have invented many life saving drugs because of well developed research and development facilities. ==Climate== Switzerland has a continental climate. The highest temperature ever recorded in Switzerland was , on 11 August 2003 in Grono. The lowest temperature ever recorded in Switzerland was , on 12 January 1987 in La Brévine. == Literature == File:Heidi.jpg'' by Johanna Spyri]] The literature of Switzerland is divided according to the language used. Most Swiss literature was written in German language from 1291 until 1798. French language became popular in Bern and elsewhere in the 18th century and many words also in the German speaking parts of Switzerland come from the French and are not known to Germans. Italian language and Romansch-Latin literature are less common in Switzerland. Heidi, a book for children by Johanna Spyri, is the most famous book of Switzerland. It is set in the mountains in Graubünden.[http://en.graubuenden.ch/highlights-switzerland/highlights/heidi.html Highlights Switzerland on state tourism site] == Sports == File:Allalinhorn 4027 2007 04 17.JPG]] Skiing, snowboarding and mountaineering are among the most popular sports in Switzerland.
