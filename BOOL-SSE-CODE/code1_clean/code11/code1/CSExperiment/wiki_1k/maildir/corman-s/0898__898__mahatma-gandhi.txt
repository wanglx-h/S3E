He is more commonly called '''Mahatma Gandhi'''. ''mahatma'' is an honorific meaning "great-soul" or "venerable" in Sanskrit. He was first called this in 1914 in Africa Gandhi on Mahabharata said he wished to live his life like Karna lived Like ''he sorrows life gave them and how they reacted upon them. You would be able to achieve what human history had never imagined.''" Gandhi was the Martyr of the Nation since 1948. Rabindranath Tagore gave him the title of 'Mahatma'. Gandhi was one of the most important people involved in the movement for the independence of India. He was a non-violence activist, who led the independence movement through a nonviolence protest. ==Early life== Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born on 2 October 1869 in Porbander, India.Hook, Sue van der Mahatma Gandhi: A proponent of Peace ABDO 2011 page 14 Several members of his family worked for the government of the state. When Gandhi was 18 years old, he went to study law in England., Agarwal, Satya P. Social Message of the Gita Motilal Banarsidass; 1st edition 1995 page 114 After he became a lawyer, he went to the British colony of Union of South Africa where he experienced laws that said people with dark Human skin colour had fewer rights than people with light skin. In 1897, Gandhi was attacked by a group of people in Durban Harbor, South Africa when he was going to work. He went to South Africa because he could not find work in India. When traveling through South Africa, Gandhi was also kicked out of a first class train because of his skin color. Then Gandhi started protesting against segregation. He decided then to become a political activist, so he could help change these unfair laws. He created a powerful, non-violent movement. During Gandhi's life, India was a colony of the British Empire, but wanted independence. He was a huge leader during that era and his thoughts helped catalyze the Indian independence movement. Gandhi was a vegetarian almost all his life, because he believed in non-violence (ahimsa). ==As an activist== On 9 January 1915 when Gandhi returned to India, he decided to again lead a march against a law called the Rowlatt Act. But then the protest turned violent and people started to kill the protesters. On 12 March 1930 Gandhi led the Salt March. When he returned to India, he helped cause India's independence from British rule, inspiring other colonial people to work for their independence, break up the British Empire, and replace it with the Commonwealth of Nations. People of many different religions and ethnic groups lived in British India. Many people thought the country should break into separate countries so different groups could have their own countries. In particular, many people thought that Hinduism and Muslims should have separate countries. Gandhi was a Hindu, but he liked ideas from many religions including Islam, Judaism, and Christianity, and he thought that people of all religions should have the same rights, and could live together peacefully in the same country. In 1938, Gandhi resigned from Congress. He said he could no longer work through Congress to unite the divisions in caste and religion. He also felt that he had little to offer to the political process.Adams, Jad. ''Gandhi: The True Man Behind Modern India. ''Pegasus Books, 2011: New York. Page 217. On 15 August 1947, the British Raj split into India and Pakistan. Gandhi wanted independence but did not want the former Raj to split into two different countries. Instead of celebrating independence day, he was crying over the end of British India. Gandhi's principle of ''satyagraha'', often translated as "way of truth" or "pursuit of truth", has inspired other democratic and anti-racist activists like Martin Luther King, Jr. and Nelson Mandela. Gandhi often said that his values were simple, based upon traditional Hindu beliefs: truth (''Satya''), and non-violence (''ahimsa''). ==Death== On 30 January 1948, he was shot to death by a Brahman activist Nathuram Godse, because Godse thought that Gandhi was too respectful to the Muslims. Godse was tried and executed by Indian officials. == References == == Notes == ==Other websites == *[http://www.gandhism.net/ Gandhism.net] historical & autobiographical website Category:1869 births Category:1948 deaths Category:Assassinated Indian politicians Category:Indian Hindus Category:Politicians from Gujarat Category:Indian revolutionaries Category:Nonviolence advocates Category:People murdered in India Category:National symbols of India Category:Vegetarians Category:Time People of the Year Category:Nationalism Category:Mahatma Gandhi Category:Presidents of the Indian National Congress Category:Indian National Congress politicians
