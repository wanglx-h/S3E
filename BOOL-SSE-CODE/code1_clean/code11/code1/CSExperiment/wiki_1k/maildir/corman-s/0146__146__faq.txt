'''FAQ''' is an abbreviation for "Frequently Asked Question(s)". The term is used for a list of questions and answers. All of the questions are supposed to be asked often and they all are about the same thing. Since the acronym was first used in written form, there are different ways it is said; both "fak" and "F.A.Q." are commonly used. == References == == Other websites == * [http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/F/FAQ.html FAQ definition], :en:Jargon_File * [https://frequentlyasked.net/ Frequently Asked Questions] * [https://faqans.com/ Frequently Asked Questions And Answer] Category:Internet slang
