File:Kauai from space oriented.jpg '''Kauai''' ('''Kaua'i''' in Hawaiian language) is the second oldest (after Ni'ihau) and fourth largest of the main Hawaiian Islands, in the United States. Known also as the "Garden Isle", Kaua'i lies 73 miles (117 kilometers) across the Kauai Channel, northwest of Honolulu on Oahu. It is of volcano origin. The highest point on the island is Kawaikini. It is located above sea level. The wettest spot on Earth, with average rainfall of a year, is just east of Mount Waialeale. The high yearly rainfall has eroded deep valleys and canyons in the central mountain. The waterfalls that have been created by erosion in canyons are now popular tourist spots. The city of Lihue, Hawaii, on the island's southeast side, is the seat of Kauai County, Hawaii. It has a population of around 6,500, and is the main city on the island. Waimea, Hawaii, which is located on the island's southwest side and the first capital of Kauai, was the first place visited by English peopleexplorer Captain James Cook in 1778. It was also the first capital of Kauai. The city is at the head of one of the most beautiful canyons in the world, Waimea Canyon, whose gorge is 900 meters (3,000 feet) deep. The island of Kauai was featured in Disney's 2002 animated movie ''Lilo & Stitch''. :en:Lihue Airport is the only commercial airport on the island.
