| '' or '''' (also in Greek: – ["Dominion (Literally 'kingdom' but also interpreted as 'empire') of the Romans"]) and ''Romania''. '''' means Roman "commonwealth" and can refer to both the Republican and the Imperial eras. '''' (or "") refers to the territorial extent of Roman authority. '''' ("the Roman people") has often been used to indicate the Roman state in matters involving other nations. The term ''Romania'', initially a colloquial term for the empire's territory as well as a collective noun for its inhabitants, appears in Greek and Latin sources from the 4th century onward and was eventually carried over to the Eastern Roman Empire (see R.L. Wolff, "Romania: The Latin Empire of Constantinople" in ''Speculum'' 23 (1948), pp. 1–34 and especially pp. 2–3).}} | }}}} }} | status = Empire | life_span = }}}} }}}} – 1453 AD }}}} | p1 = Roman Republic | s1 = Western Roman Empire | flag_p1 = | flag_s1 = Labarum_of_the_Roman_Empire_(simple).png | flag_s2 = Byzantine_imperial_flag,_14th_century.svg | s2 = Eastern Roman Empire | image_flag = Vexilloid of the Roman Empire.svg | flag_border = no | flag_size = 100px | flag_type = Vexillum | image_coat = Roman_Aquilla.png | coa_size = 100 px | symbol_type = Imperial Aquila (Roman) | image_map = Roman Empire Trajan 117AD.png | image_map_caption = The Roman Empire at its greatest extent, 117 AD, the time of Trajan's death (with its vassals in pink)..

The Empire of Nicaea is considered the legitimate continuation of the Roman Empire because it managed to retake Constantinople. | common_languages = * Latin * Greek language * Languages of the Roman Empire | religion = * Imperial cult (ancient Rome)-driven Religion in ancient Rome * Nicene Christianity | demonym = Roman | government_type = Elective monarchy, functionally absolute monarchy | title_leader = Some Roman emperor#Titles and positions | year_leader1 = | leader1 = Augustus | year_leader2 = 98 AD – 117 AD | leader2 = Trajan | year_leader3 = 270 AD – 275 AD | leader3 = Aurelian | year_leader4 = 284 AD – 305 AD | leader4 = Diocletian | year_leader5 = 306 AD – 337 AD | leader5 = Constantine I | year_leader6 = 379 AD – 395 AD | leader6 = Theodosius IThe final emperor to rule over all of the Roman Empire's territories before its conversion to a diarchy. | year_leader7 = 474 AD – 480 AD | leader7 = Julius NeposOfficially the final emperor of the Western empire. | year_leader8 = 475 AD – 476 AD | leader8 = Romulus Augustus | year_leader9 = 527 AD – 565 AD | leader9 = Justinian I | year_leader10 = 780 AD – 797 AD | leader10 = Constantine VIFinal ruler to be universally recognized as Roman Emperor, including by the papacy and the Western European powers. | year_leader11 = 976 AD – 1025 AD | leader11 = Basil II | year_representative1 = 1449 AD – 1453 AD | representative1 = Constantine XI PalaiologosLast emperor of the Eastern (Byzantine) empire. | legislature = Senate of the Roman Empire | era = Classical era to Late Middle Ages | date_pre = 32 BC – 30 BC | event_pre = Final War of the Roman Republic | year_start = 30 BC – 2 BC | event_start = Constitutional reforms of Augustus | date_event1 = 11 May 330 AD | event1 = Constantinople#306–337becomes capital | date_event2 = 17 January 395 AD | event2 = | date_event3 = 4 September 476 AD | event3 = Fall of the Western Roman Empire | date_event4 = 25 April 480 AD | event4 = Murder of Emperor Julius Nepos | date_event5 = 12 April 1204 | event5 = Fourth Crusade | date_event6 = 25 July 1261 | event6 = Reconquest of Constantinople | year_end = 1453 | date_end = 29 May | event_end = Fall of Constantinople | event_post = Fall of Empire of Trebizond | date_post = 15 August 1461 | stat_year1 = 25 BC | stat_area1 = 2750000 | stat_pop1 = 56,800,000 | stat_year2 = 117 AD | stat_area2 = 5000000–6500000 | stat_pop2 = | stat_year3 = 390 AD | stat_area3 = 4400000 | stat_pop3 = | currency = Sestertius,Abbreviated "HS".

Aureus, Solidus (coin), Solidus (coin) }} The '''Roman Empire''' ruled the Mediterranean Sea and much of Europe, Western Asia and North Africa. The Romans conquered most of this during the Republic, and it was ruled by emperors following Augustus assumption of effective sole rule in 27 BC. The western empire collapsed in 476 AD, but the eastern empire lasted until the fall of Constantinople in 1453. The Empire started in 27 BC, when Octavian became Emperor Augustus after the death of Julius Caesar. The fall of Western Roman Empire to the Germanic kings in 476 AD, marked the end of classical antiquity and the beginning of the Middle Ages. The Empire was the third stage of Ancient Rome. Rome was first ruled by Roman Kingdom, later by the Roman Republic and then by an emperor. Many modern lands were once part of the Roman Empire such as, Roman Britain (not Scotland), Spain, Portugal, France, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Germany, Egypt, The Levant, Crimea, Switzerland and the northern coast of Africa. The main language of the Roman Empire was Latin, with Ancient Greek language as an important secondary language, especially in the Eastern provinces. The Western half of the Roman Empire lasted for about 500 years until the barbarian general Odoacer defeated its final emperor, Romulus Augustus. On the other hand, the eastern half, consisting of the Balkans, Anatolia, The Levant and Egypt, continued for about 1000 more years before falling to the Ottoman Empire. The The Levant and Egypt were lost to the Arabs in the 8th century. The eastern part was the Byzantine Empire, more commonly known as the Byzantine Empire. Its capital was Constantinople, which is now called Istanbul. == Government == In order to control their large empire, the Romans developed ideas about law and government. They developed the best army in the world at the time and ruled by force. They had fine engineering and built roads, cities, and outstanding buildings. The Empire was divided into provinces, each with a governor plus wikt:civil and military support. Letter (paper), both official and private, went constantly to and from Rome. Trade was most important for Rome, a city of more than a million people (which was by far the largest city in the world). It needed and got wheat from Egypt, tin from Britannia, grapes from Gaul and so on. In return, the Romans built provincial capitals into fine cities, protected them from raids by barbarians. They gave education and career opportunities for young people in the provinces, such as jobs in the Roman army. In principle, Emperors had absolute control and could do as they pleased. In practice, they faced some difficult problems. They had a staff of what would today be called "civil service" and the advice of the Roman Senate. The emperor had to decide the most important issues facing the empire, and what should be done about them. Most tried to do two things. One was doing things to improve the life of Romans in peacetime. The other was fighting and defeating Rome's enemies, which the wealthy empire always had. For Roman emperors the succession would often be an adoption son. The Emperor would notice an outstanding young man from one of the best families and would adopt him as his son. Before he died, he would make clear who he thought should succeed him. He could make his adopted son a Roman consul, or state in his will (law) that the younger man should succeed him. Sometimes, that worked well. but not always. Every now and then, a civil war would be fought between claimants to the throne. An adopted son or two gave the Emperor more choices. Some Emperors had no son, and others had sons who did not survive. Later on, Emperors grew so weak that the Roman army would just pick one of their generals to be the next Emperor, which sometimes led to civil war. The Romans fought many wars against other countries and against barbarians several times. They enjoyed watching violent sports. They watched chariots races and fights between gladiators (men using weapons). Unlike in modern sports, the fighters were often killed in fights. Romans enjoyed those shows in the Colosseum. The Romans had great civil engineering. They built many large public buildings and villas, aqueducts to carry water, stone bridges and roads. Some of those things can still be seen today. Many famous writers were Romans, including Cicero and Virgil. The New Testament of the Bible tells about the Romans in the life of Jesus Christ. During Jesus' life, the Romans, who were pagans, ruled his country. Later, several emperors tried to history of Christianity#persecutions but did not succeed. By 312 , Emperor Galerius allowed people freedom to follow Christianity, and the next year, a general, Constantine I (Rome), became Emperor and converted to Christianity. The city of Rome was taken over several times by barbarians, notably in 410 when a barbarian tribe called the Goths sacked the city (looting). The last Western Roman emperor, Romulus Augustus, abdicated in 476 . The Roman Empire would last another 1000 years as the Byzantine Empire in the East. The main coin of the Roman Empire was the silver denarius. Later denarii were smaller. Various reasons have been given for the fall of Rome. Edward Gibbon wrote ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'' in which he investigated various ideas. Chief among them was, in his opinion, the effect of Christianity on the ability of the Empire to defend itself militarily. Other historians blame the unstable system of leadership. In a later 50-year period, only two of 22 emperors died a natural death. Most of the other emperors were assassinated. == References == == Other websites == * [http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11745/ An old map of the Roman Empire in 400 AD] * BBC, [http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/romans Romans for Children] , website on ancient Rome for children at the level of primary school * [http://www.classicsunveiled.com/romeh/html/index.html Rome Unleashed] , interactive educational website on ancient Rome for students Category:Roman Empire
