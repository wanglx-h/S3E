Subject: Wikipedia:Rules
Any time that people work together, it is important to make rules that they should agree to follow. Most of the rules written here must be followed by everyone, and some of the rules are still being decided. Most of the time, if a rule has not been made here, or if something that happens is not covered by the rules that are here, we will look at the :en:Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines or other Wikimedia projects. We should also use common sense. == meta:Foundation issues == The meta:Wikimedia Foundation has made rules that can never be changed. All projects must follow them: * Wikipedia:Neutral point of view is the most important rule in changing pages. * Anyone can change articles without making a username. * The "wiki process" is the way to decide what is put on the project. See Wikipedia:CONSENSUS. * All writing is available by Wikipedia:Copyrights. Wikipedia uses the Creative Commons Attribution/Share-Alike License and the Wikipedia:Simple English GFDL. ===Other rules=== * Wikipedia:Privacy policy * Wikipedia:Office actions == Policies == These are rules about how users should act. * Wikipedia:Blocks and bans * Wikipedia:Copyrights * Wikipedia:Deletion policy * Wikipedia:Edit war * Wikipedia:Image use policy * Wikipedia:Ignore all rules * Wikipedia:Merging and moving pages * Wikipedia:Neutral point of view * Wikipedia:Protection policy * Wikipedia:Username * Wikipedia:Vandalism * Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not * Wikipedia:Be kind * Wikipedia:No personal attacks * Wikipedia:Child protection * Wikipedia:Consensus == Guidelines == === Writing guidelines === These are rules for writing articles for the Simple English Wikipedia. * Wikipedia:Be bold * Wikipedia:Citing sources * Wikipedia:Core article * Wikipedia:How to write Simple English pages * Wikipedia:Manual of Style * Wikipedia:Spam * Wikipedia:Spelling * Wikipedia:Template substitution * Wikipedia:Change summary === Behaviour guidelines === These are rules for how to work better in Wikipedia together. * Wikipedia:Assume good faith * Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers * Wikipedia:User page * Wikipedia:Protecting children's privacy Category:Wikipedia policies Category:Wikipedia guidelines
