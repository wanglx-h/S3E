It was created in 1990 by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist who is credited with inventing the World Wide Web. Webpage can include writing, links, pictures, and even sound and video. HTML tells web browsers what webpages should look like. HTML also adds meta information to webpages. Meta information is information about a webpage e.g., the name of the person who created the page. Web browsers usually do not show meta information. HTML is often used with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript. CSS is used to change the way HTML looks. JavaScript tells websites how to behave. It can also change HTML and CSS. HTML is made by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). There are many versions of HTML. As of September 2018, the current standard of HTML is called HTML5 and is specifically at version 5.2. == Tags == HTML uses "elements" to let the browser know how a webpage is made of. Elements are shown as "tags" in the code, written with angle brackets: . Tags ''usually'' come in pairs: an opening tag defines the start of a block of content and a closing tag defines the end of that block of content. There are many kinds of tags, and each one has a different purpose. See '''HTML#Example HTML tags''' below for tag examples. Some tags only work in certain browsers. For example, the tag, which was used to make something appear when the person Click the right button of the Computer mouse, only worked on the Mozilla Firefox browser until version 85. Other browsers simply ignore this tag and display the writing normally. Many web page creators avoid using these "non-standard" tags because they want their pages to look the same with all browsers. == Example == Here is an example page in HTML with "Hello world program". Hi world! Hello world! The Text between and describes the web page, and the text between and is the page content. defines the browser page title. == Example HTML tags == Here are some example HTML tags: }} {| class="wikitable sortable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed" !
