Life, Philosophy, & Works Britannica|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Plato|access-date=2024-03-17|website=www.britannica.com|language=en}} Born to wealthy parents in Athens, Greece, Plato was a student of Socrates (who did not write) and, later, became the teacher of Aristotle. Plato started a university in Athens called the Academy where he taught. Plato wrote about many ideas in philosophy that are still talked about today, including political philosophy and the philosophy of language. One modern scholar, Alfred North Whitehead, said that all Europe philosophy since Plato is a series of footnotes to his works. ==Dialogues== Plato wrote his books in the form of conversations called dialogues. In a dialogue, two or more people talk about ideas and sometimes disagree over them. The ''Laws (Plato)'' is Plato's longest dialogue and probably his last.

Plato's pointing is sometimes thought to wikt:symbolize Plato's theory of forms, which exist in another realm.]] Socrates is usually the main person in Plato's dialogues. Often, Socrates talks with people and tries to see if they believe anything that is logic. Because of this, some people became angry with Socrates and tried to kill him. In Plato's Apology, Socrates is put on trial by these people and is eventually Sentence (law) to death by drinking poison. ==Theory of Forms== Plato is famous for developing the theory of forms. This theory says that everything in our world is imperfect but wikt:correspond to a perfect version of itself that exists in another wikt:realm. For example, there are wooden Chair, metal chairs, square chairs, big chairs, small chairs, etc. All the chairs we can ever sit in, according to Plato, are imperfect versions of the perfect form of “chairness,” the ideal chair. The same is true of every other object our senses can wikt:perceive: it is imperfect but corresponds to a perfect version of itself. One simple way to think about Plato's theory is with numbers. The difference between "chairness" and a regular chair is similar to the difference between the number five and having five apples, oranges, pears, etc. In other words, Plato thought that the world we live in is just a shadow of the real, "intelligible realm," which only a few people will ever understand. He thought that all perfect forms come from perfection itself, which he called "the good.” == Plato vs. Socrates == People who study Plato argue about whether Socrates really said the same things that Plato makes him say, or whether Plato just used Socrates as a character to make the ideas he was talking about seem more important. == Works by Plato == There are many dialogues that were written by Plato.
