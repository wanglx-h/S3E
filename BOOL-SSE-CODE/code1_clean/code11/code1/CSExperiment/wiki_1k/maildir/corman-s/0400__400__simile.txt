Subject: Simile
A '''simile''' is a figure of speech that compares two different things, usually by using the words 'like' or 'as'. It is used to make a ''direct and clear wikt:comparison between two things .Similes'' may be confused with metaphors, which do the same kind of thing. Similes use comparisons, with the words 'like' or 'as'. Metaphors use indirect comparisons, without the words 'like' or 'as'. *Similes: **'''Like''' a hungry wolf, he ate the food. **A dragonfly is '''like''' a plane: they both fly and cannot close their wings. ** He fought '''like''' a lion. ** The color yellow is '''like''' walking into a surprise birthday party. *The other team's quarterback is '''as''' big '''as''' a redwood tree *Kingda Ka is '''as''' green '''as''' a pine tree ** ==Other websites== *[http://www.wdl.org/en/item/2981 "On substantiation through transitive relations"] is an old manuscript written by the Arabic language scholar Sayf al-Din al-Amidi.
