File:Black.pngIn light, '''black''' is the absence of all color. It is a shade. In painting, however, black pigment is the combination of all colors. In heraldry, black is called "sable". It is the opposite of white. ==Black in science== In science, an object that is fully black would absorb all the light that hits it. Because this object would not reflect any light, the human eye would not see any colors coming from that object, and would see this object as black. A way to create black objects is to mix Pigment. A pigment works by reflecting only the color of the pigment. For example, a blue pigment absorbs all colors except blue. By mixing pigments in the right quantities, black can be made. In sunlight, black objects become warm more quickly than other colored objects because they absorb more light. == Meaning of black == Black is associated with power, elegance, formality, safety, birth, male, evil and mystery. Black the darkest color there is. Black, along with gray and white, is a ''neutral'' color. This means that it is not a ''hot'' color or a ''cool'' color. Black is a color seen with fear and the unknown. It can have a bad meaning (blackbird, black bunny) or a good meaning ('in the black', 'black is beautiful'). Black can stand for strength and power. It can be a formal, elegant and high-class color (black tie, black Mercedes). ==Related pages== * List of colors * Atomic physics * Blackbody radiation * Quantum mechanics * Vantablack Category:Basic English 850 words
