File:Lateral head anatomy detail.jpg '''Anatomy''' is the research of the bodies of people and other animals. Anatomy is the study of the inside of the body and outside the body. Anatomy notes the position and structure of organs such as Muscle, Gland and Bone. A person who studies anatomy is an anatomist. The history of anatomy dates back to 1600 BC when Ancient Egypt began studying human anatomy. They discovered the functions of many organs like the liver, spleen, Kidney, heart etc. and were the first to discover the structure and functions of the lymphatic system. For long periods the dissection of deceased people was forbidden, and correct ideas about human anatomy was a long time coming.Singer, Charles 1925. ''The evolution of anatomy: a short history of anatomical and physiological discovery to Harvey''. London:Kegan Paul. Trench, Trubner & Co.Choulant, Ludwig 1945. ''History & bibliography of anatomical illustration''. NY: Hafner. Academic human anatomists are usually employed by University, Medical school and teaching hospitals. They are often involved in teaching and research. Gross anatomy studies parts of the body that are big enough to see. Micro-anatomy studies smaller parts. == Body systems == There are different organ system, such as the cardiovascular system, also known as the circulatory system (the system that gets blood around the body), the muscular system (the system that contains muscles), the nervous system (the system that controls the nerves, and the brain) and the skeleton (the bones). Anatomy, physiology and biochemistry are similar basic medical sciences. ==Related pages== * Anatomical terms of location * Medicine * Zoology ** Comparative anatomy ** Organ (anatomy) * Gray's Anatomy * Vesalius * William Harvey ==References== Category:Anatomy
