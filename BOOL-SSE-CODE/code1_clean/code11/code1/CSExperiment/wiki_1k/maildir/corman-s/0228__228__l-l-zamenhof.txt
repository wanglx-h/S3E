L. Zamenhof''' and sometimes as the pseudonymous '''Dr. Esperanto''', was an eye doctor, Linguistics (who creates a language), and wikt:scholar who created the International auxiliary language Esperanto. == Biography == Zamenhof was born in 1859 in the town of Białystok, Poland. At the time, Poland was a part of the Russian Empire. Bialystok contained three major groups: Poles, Belorussians, and Yiddish-speaking Jews. Zamenhof thought that one common language would join these groups and stop fights between them. His first language was said to be Polish language. His parents spoke Russian language and Yiddish at home. His father was a German language teacher, so Zamenhof learned that language from an early age and spoke the language fluently. Later he learned French language, Latin, Greek language, Hebrew language and English language. He also had an interest in Italian language, Spanish language and Lithuanian language. Zamenhof decided that the international language must have a simple grammar and be easier to learn than Volapük, an earlier international language. He wikt:attempt to create the international language with a grammar that was wikt:rich, and wikt:complex. The basics of Esperanto were published in 1887. He translated the Hebrew Bible into Esperanto. His grandson, Louis-Christophe Zaleski-Zamenhof, was an engineer. He was 14 times nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize between 1907 and 1917. ==Partial bibliography== ===Original works=== * ''Unua Libro'', 1887 (''First Book'') * ''Dua Libro'', 1888 (''Second Book'') * [http://www.esperanto.mv.ru/Hilelismo/index_e.html ''Hilelismo – propono pri solvo de la hebrea demando''] , 1901 (''Hillelism: A Project in Response to the Jewish Question'') * [http://joaojosesantos.net/html/pdf/zamenhofo_esenco_kaj_estonteco_de_la_lingvo_internacia.pdf ''Esenco kaj estonteco de la ideo de lingvo internacia''] , 1903 (''Essence and Future of the Idea of an International Language'') * [https://www.gutenberg.org/files/8224/8224-h/8224-h.htm ''Fundamenta Krestomatio de la Lingvo Esperanto''] , 1903 (''Basic Anthology of the Esperanto Language'') * ''Fundamento de Esperanto'', 1905 (''Foundation of Esperanto'') * Declaration of Boulogne, 1905 * [http://homarano.narod.ru/Windows/homar_e.htm ''Homaranismo''] , 1913 (''Humanitism'') ====Periodicals==== * ''La Esperantisto'', 1889–1895 (''The Esperantist'') * ''Lingvo Internacia (periodical)'', 1895–1914 (''International Language'') * ''La Revuo'', 1906–1914 (''The Review'') ====Poems==== * "Al la fratoj" ("To the Brothers") * "Ho, mia kor'" ("Oh, My Heart") * "La Espero" ("The Hope") * "La vojo" ("The Way") * "Mia penso" ("My Thought") ===Translations=== * [http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37279 ''Hamleto, Reĝido de Danujo''] , 1894 (''Hamlet'', by William Shakespeare) * [http://esperanto.davidgsimpson.com/inko/100-3.pdf ''La batalo de l' vivo''] (''The Battle of Life'', by Charles Dickens) * ''s:eo:La revizoro'', 1907 (''The Government Inspector'', by Nikolai Gogol) * ''La Predikanto'', 1907 (translation of Ecclesiastes) * ''La Psalmaro'', 1908 (translation of the book of Psalms) * [http://steloj.de/esperanto/rabistoj/index.html ''La rabistoj''] , 1908 (''The Robbers'', by Friedrich Schiller) * [http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22592 ''Ifigenio en Taŭrido''] , 1908 (''Iphigenia in Tauris (Goethe)'', by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe) * ''La Rabeno de Baĥaraĥ'', 1909 ("The Rabbi of Bacharach", by Heinrich Heine) * ''La Gimnazio'', 1909 ("The High School", by Scholem Aleichem) * [http://www.ipernity.com/doc/esperanto-muzeo-svitavy/40592976 ''Marta''] , 1910 (''Marta'', by Eliza Orzeszkowa) * ''Genezo'', 1911 (translation of the Book of Genesis) * ''Eliro'', 1912 (translation of the Book of Exodus) * ''Levidoj'', 1912 (translation of the Book of Leviticus) * ''Nombroj'', 1914 (translation of the Book of Numbers) * ''Readmono'', 1914 (translation of the Book of Deuteronomy) * s:eo:Malnova Testamento (Zamenhof) (parts of the Old Testament) == References == Category:1859 births Category:1917 deaths Category:Bible translators Category:Esperantists Category:Inventors Category:Jewish scientists Category:Recipients of the Order of the Legion of Honour Category:Linguists Category:Polish Jews Category:Polish scientists Category:Zionists
