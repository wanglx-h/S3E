File:Iceedgekils.gif The '''Southern Ocean''', also called the '''Antarctic Ocean''', is the ocean around the continent of Antarctica. The fourth-largest sea by area, at 20,327,000km², it has a coastline 17,968km long and is surrounded by the waters of the Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean, and Indian Oceans. Since the 1770s, geographers have discussed its limits, but the latitude sixty Degree (angle) south is now often accepted. It includes several seas like Cosmonauts, Somov, Commonwealth, and Mowson. == Other websites == * [http://www.whoi.edu/imageOfDay.do Oceanography Image of the Day], from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution * [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/oo.html The CIA World Factbook's] entry on the Southern Ocean * [http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa091500a.htm The Fifth Ocean] from Geography.About.com * [http://dapper.pmel.noaa.gov/dchart/ NOAA In-situ Ocean Data Viewer] Plot and download ocean observations * [http://findanswers.noaa.gov/noaa.answers/consumer/kbdetail.asp?kbid=595&start=121 NOAA FAQ about the number of oceans] Category:Southern Ocean Category:Geography of Antarctica
