File:Andouille.jpg File:Andouille-Scheiben.jpg '''Andouille''' is a type of pork sausage. It is spicy (hot in taste) and smoked. There are different kinds, all with different combinations of pork meat, fat, intestines (tubes going to the stomach), and tripe (the wall of the stomach). Other sorts are "French andouille" and "German andouille"; they are less spicy than Cajun. Cajun has extra sodium chloride, black pepper, and garlic. Andouille makers smoke the sausages over pecan wood and sugar cane for a maximum of seven or eight hours, at about 175 degrees Fahrenheit (80 degrees Celsius). Category:Sausage
