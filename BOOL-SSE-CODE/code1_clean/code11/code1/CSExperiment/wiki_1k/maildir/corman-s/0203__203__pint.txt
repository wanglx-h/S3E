The '''pint''' (abbreviated '''pt''') is a unit of volume in imperial units and United States customary units. There are three types of pints used in different countries. An imperial pint and US pint both equal of a quart and of a gallon. An imperial fluid ounce is approximately 4% smaller than a US fluid ounce although an imperial pint has 4 more fluid ounces than a US pint, making an imperial pint approximately 20% larger than a US pint. ==Imperial Pint== The imperial pint is the pint used in England, Canada, Republic of Ireland, and Burma. The unit may appear in other Commonwealth of Nations. Confusion in Canada often arises as liquids are occasionally sold in U.S. pints, near the border, although the official and only pint that is legal in Canada is the imperial pint. The imperial system has no dry pint and volume in dry units, since solid objects are measured by mass. 1 imperial pint equals 568,261.25mm3. An imperial fluid ounce is approximately 4% smaller than a US fluid ounce although an imperial pint has 4 more fluid ounces than a US pint, making an imperial pint approximately 20% larger than a US pint. {| class="wikitable" |- !

It is more common than the dry pint which is used for non-liquid volume measurements. 1 US pint is exactly equal to 473,176.473mm3, defined by the international yard and pound agreement. {| class="wikitable" |- !
