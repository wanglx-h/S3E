He is known as the father of computer science. He was born in Maida Vale, London.Newman M.H.A. 1955. Alan Mathison Turing. 1912–1954. ''Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society'' '''1''': 253. [http://rsbm.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/1/253] == Early life == Turing was born in Maida Vale, London. His father came from a Scottish merchant family. His mother, Ethel Sara Stoney, was the daughter of an engineer from Ireland. Turing was very good at math when he was young. == Education == He went to school at St. Michael’s in St Leonards-on-Sea. Later, he studied at University of Cambridge and Princeton University. == Career == In 1936, Turing wrote about a theoretical machine called the Turing machine. This idea became important in the development of computers. He also created the idea of a computer program. During World War II, Turing worked at Bletchley Park. He helped break secret German messages made by the Enigma (machine). This helped the Allies win the war and may have saved millions of lives. He worked for the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS), using cryptanalysis to break Nazi codes. Later, he helped design the ACE (computer) (ACE), one of the first stored-program computers. He presented the design in 1946.Copeland, B. Jack 2006. ''Colossus: The secrets of Bletchley Park's code-breaking computers''. Oxford University Press. p108 Turing was also interested in artificial intelligence. He proposed the Turing test to check if a machine can "think".Harnad, Stevan 2008.

In: Epstein, Robert & Peters, Grace (eds) ''Parsing the Turing Test: philosophical and methodological issues in the quest for the thinking computer''. Springer == Private life == Turing was homosexual. In 1952, he admitted to having sex with a man. At that time, being gay was illegal in the UK. He was conviction and had to choose between prison or taking hormones to reduce his sex drive. He chose the medicine. This caused him health problems like impotence and breast growth. == Death == In 1954, Turing died from cyanide poisoning. Some say he ate a poisoned apple, but the apple was never tested.Hodges, Andrew 1983. ''Alan Turing: the enigma''. London: Burnett Books, p488. It is believed he died by suicide. == Legacy == In 2009, a petition asked the UK Government to say sorry for how Turing was treated. Prime Minister Gordon Brown later gave an apology and called Turing's treatment "appalling". In 2013, Queen Elizabeth II gave him a royal pardon. The “Turing Law” was later passed to pardon other men who were punished under old anti-gay laws. == References == == Other websites == *Jack Copeland 2012.
