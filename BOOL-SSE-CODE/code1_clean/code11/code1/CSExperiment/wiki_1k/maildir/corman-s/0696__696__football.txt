The best-known type of football is association football. This is called "soccer" in North America, South Africa, and Australia to avoid confusion with other types of football that are commonly played there. The name "football" comes from the two words "wikt:foot" and "wikt:ball". It is named "football", because the players of the game walking and often running (on their foot) while playing, as opposed to (for example) polo where the players ride horses. Football is played using a ball, also called a football, that is usually shaped like a sphere or an ellipsoid. The ball is often kicked with the foot, but depending on the game, it can also be hit using other parts of the body (in association football) and handling the ball is a part of some other sports known as football. Players can use any part of their body except their arms and hands. Goal keepers can use every part of their body to keep the ball out of the goal. Some elements of football have been seen in many countries, dating back to the second and third century AD in China. The modern games of both rugby football and association football comes from 19th century England.Green, Geoffrey (953; ''The history of the Football Association''.
