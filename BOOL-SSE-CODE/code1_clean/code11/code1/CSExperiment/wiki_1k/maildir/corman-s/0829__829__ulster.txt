The others are Leinster, Munster and Connacht. There are nine county in Ulster. Three of them are in the Republic of Ireland: *County Cavan *County Donegal *County Monaghan The other six counties make up all of Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom: *County Antrim *County Armagh *County Down *County Fermanagh *County Londonderry *County Tyrone Due to the fact that most of Ulster is in Northern Ireland, the name "Ulster" is also sometimes used to mean ''Northern Ireland'', even though Northern Ireland is only part of Ulster. This is called ''totum pro parte'' in Latin which means "the whole for a part". Category:Ulster
