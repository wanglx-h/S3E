Terrorism has no official criminal law definition at the International law. Common definitions of terrorism refer to violent acts which are intended to create fear. The acts may be done for a Religion, political or Ideology Motivation and use illegal violence. Some definitions now include acts of unlawful violence and war crimes. The use of similar tactics by criminal gangs is not usually called terrorism. The same actions may be called terrorism when they are done by a politically-motivated group. There are over 10,000 definitions of "terrorism". In some cases, the same group may be described as "Freedom fighter" by its supporters and "terrorists" by its opponents.
