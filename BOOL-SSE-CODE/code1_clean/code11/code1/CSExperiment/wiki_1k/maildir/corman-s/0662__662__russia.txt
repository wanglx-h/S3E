Many Fossil of Archaic human were found in Denisova Cave in the Altai Mountains. Russia had some of the last living Neanderthal around 45,000 years ago. They were found in Mezmaiskaya cave in Adygea. File:Ethnic map of Russia 2010.png]] The first known ''Homo sapiens'' (Ust'-Ishim man) in Russia lived around 45,000 years ago. They lived in Western Siberia. Fossils of Human from around 40,000 years ago were found at the Archaeological site of Kostyonki–Borshchyovo and Sungir. Both of these places are in European Russia. Humans got to Arctic Russia at least 40,000 years ago. Fossils and Artifact (culture) were found at Mamontovaya Kurya in the Komi Republic. The Kurgan hypothesis says that the Volga-Dnieper region of southern Russia and Ukraine is the homeland of the Proto-Indo-Europeans. The Indo-Europeans moved across many parts of Eurasia and spread the Indo-European languages and Yamnaya ancestry. Artifacts from these Civilization were found in Ipatovo kurgan, Sintashta, Arkaim, and Pazyryk burials. The earliest known use of Horses in warfare was found in these places as well.

It became part of the Kingdom of Pontus in 107 BC until Pontus was conquered by the Roman Empire.

This form of Christianity influenced Russian culture greatly. Kievan Rus' eventually broke up and the lands were divided into many small Feudalism.

The attack was part of World War II. The war lasted in Europe until May 1945, and Russia lost more than 20 million people during that time. In spite of this large loss, Russia was one of the winners of the war and became a world superpower. In 1961, Yuri Gagarin flew into Outer space. He was the first man who was in space. Since this period USSR was considered to be a space power. It was during the Space Race between USSR and USA. From 1922 to 1991, Russia was the largest part of the Soviet Union, or the ''Union of Soviet Socialist Republics'' (USSR). People sometimes used the name "Russia" for the whole Soviet Union, or sometimes "Soviet Russia". Russia was only one of 15 Soviet Socialist Republics. The republic was in fact named the "Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic" (RSFSR). The Soviet Union fell apart in 1991. Russia took over the place of the USSR in the United Nations (UN). === History of present Russian Federation === File:Moscow, City May 2010 03.JPG under construction]] Boris Yeltsin was made the President of Russia in June 1991, in the first direct presidential election in Russian history. Wide-ranging reforms took place, for example privatization and free trade laws. Radical changes (shock therapy) were recommended by the United States and International Monetary Fund. A major economic crisis followed. There was 50% decline in Gross domestic product and industrial output between 1990 and 1995. The privatization largely shifted control of enterprises from state agencies to individuals with inside connections in the government system. Many of the newly rich business people took billions in cash and assets outside of the country. The depression of state and economy led to the collapse of social services. Millions went into poverty, from 1.5% of people being in poverty in the late Soviet era to 39–49% by mid-1993. The 1990s had extreme corruption and lawlessness, and the rise of criminal gangs and violent crime. The 1990s had many armed conflicts in the North Caucasus. There were both local ethnic battles and separatist Islamist insurrections. Because the Chechnya separatists declared independence in the early 1990s, a Chechen War was fought between the rebel groups and the Russian military. Terrorist attacks against civilians caused hundreds of deaths. The most notable of these were the Moscow theater hostage crisis and Beslan school siege. Russia took responsibility for settling the USSR's external debts, even though its population made up just half of the population of the USSR at the time of its dissolution. High budget Economic deficit caused the 1998 Russian financial crisis and resulted in more GDP decline. On 31 December 1999, President Yeltsin Resignation (quit being the president). The job of president was given to the recently Appointment Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin. Putin then won the 2000 presidential election. Putin stopped the Chechen rebellion quickly, but violence still occurs in the Northern Caucasus at times. High oil prices and initially weak currency followed by increasing Demand, Consumption (economics) and investments has helped the economy grow for nine straight years. This improved the standard of living and increased Russia's influence on the world stage. While many reforms made during the Putin presidency have been criticized by Western nations as un-democratic, Putin's leadership led to stability and progress. This won him widespread popularity in Russia. On 2 March 2008, Dmitry Medvedev was elected President of Russia, whilst Putin became Prime Minister of Russia. Putin went back to being the president after the 2012 presidential elections, and Medvedev was made the Prime Minister. On 24 February 2022, the Russian Federation attacked Ukraine, starting the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. On 23 June 2023, Wagner Group, a Russian paramilitary organization, initiated a rebellion against the government of Russia. The revolt arose amidst escalating tensions between the :en:Ministry_of_Defence_(Russia) and Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of Wagner Group. == Size and resources == At , Russia is the largest country in the world.

Russia spans eleven time zones and has a wide range of environments and landforms. Russia has the world's largest reserves of mineral and energy resources, and is the largest producer of oil and natural gas in the world. Russia has the world's largest forest reserves,[http://www.fao.org/docrep/014/i1757r/i1757r.pdf FAO. 2010. Global Forest Resources Assesment 2010. Main Report.

Important issues are decided by the Federation President. Lesser powers are given to the member republics. At the end of the twentieth century, Russia experienced many political changes. Some people fought to leave the federation. Elections are held at all levels. According to Steve White, the present government made it clear that they had no plans of making a "second edition" of the American or British political system. Instead they wanted a system that was closer to Russia's own traditions. Richard Sakwa wrote that the Government of Russia is considered legitimate by the majority of the Russian people. It seeks to deliver a set of public goods without trying to fit to extra-democratic logic to achieve them. Whether the system is becoming less autocratic (dictatorial) is debatable. === Politics === There are four big political parties in Russia.
