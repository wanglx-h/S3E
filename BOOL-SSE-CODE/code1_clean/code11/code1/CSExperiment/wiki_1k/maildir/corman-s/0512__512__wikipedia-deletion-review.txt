Subject: Wikipedia:Deletion review
= Current requests = == Maritime science fiction == * The article was reliably sourced and even the leading citation specifically used the term maritime science fiction in it's texts. The article qualified as a stub and a number of users contributed to it. Nobody supported the deletion besides the nominator. The argument "it was deleted from main English Wikipedia" was the article did not cite reliable sources. This entry was a DIFFERENT ENTRY from the one on English Wikipedia. Note: that main English Wikipedia has a list on Maritime science fiction media that was renamed to "List of Underwater science fiction media." But there were sources cited that clearly used ''Maritime science fiction'' and they were academic. They discussed maritime archeology.

This message was supposed to be closed on June 25th. No comments had been submitted by anyone until this date. After the mentioned date, it was deleted with one comment. But apart from this, my question is: Why should an article that is translated from a Persian article be deleted? Why was the source of my published article not taken into account? Why did you not edit a series of articles that I saw, and did not delete them, but only expanded them? Milad Salehpour Siavash Aghdaei Articles that were weaker than mine.

I believe the article was deleted despite the subject meeting the General Notability Guideline (GNG), based on the following independent, reliable sources: * Inter Press Service (IPS) – a reliable, independent news agency featured a dedicated profile on Saningong: - https://ipsnews.net/business/2025/01/16/from-the-lab-to-the-world-stage-how-akuma-saningong-redefines-the-boundaries-of-possibility/ * Scientific Publications in Peer-Reviewed Journals – Saningong is a co-author on multiple studies indexed in PubMed: - https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19074982/ - https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29478084/ - https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25645591/ * TEDx Appearances – Saningong has given three TEDx talks: - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmCgzP7rrM4&t=5s - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8ix47WFQqw&t=3s - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNXME3K8P3M&t=12s * Additional Secondary Coverage: - https://greator.com/en/akuma-saningong/ - https://www.hamburg-startups.net/kac-baut-startup-bruecken-zwischen-hamburg-und-afrika/ - https://spirit-online.de/stichworte/dr-akuma-saningong I believe the deletion may have overlooked the totality of these sources, especially the profile-level coverage in IPS and the combination of scholarly and public-facing contributions. '''Request for Undeletion to Improve the Article''' Given the additional secondary sources now identified and the willingness to improve the article with better referencing and structure, I suggest that the article be temporarily undelete and moved to my userspace for improvement. This would allow for: - Proper integration of independent, reliable sources such as Inter Press Service (IPS) - More clearly organized citations and neutral tone improvements - Evaluation in draft form by other editors via Articles for Creation (AfC) I welcome further input on how to best meet the General Notability Guideline and would be glad to collaborate toward a stronger encyclopedic article.
