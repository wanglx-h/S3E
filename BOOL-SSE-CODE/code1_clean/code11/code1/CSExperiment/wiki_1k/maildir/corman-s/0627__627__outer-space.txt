It is where all of the planets, stars, galaxy and Astronomical object are found. It is the expanse that exists beyond Earth and Atmosphere of Earth. On Earth, space begins at the Kármán line (100km above sea level). This is where Atmosphere of Earth is said to stop and outer space begins. This is not a natural boundary but is a wikt:convention used by scientists and diplomats. == List of spaces == === Geospace === Geospace is the region of outer space near Earth. It includes the upper region of the atmosphere and the magnetosphere.Schrijver, Carolus J. & Siscoe, George L. 2010. ''Heliophysics: evolving solar activity and the climates of Space and Earth''. Cambridge University Press, p363. The Van Allen radiation belt lies within the geospace. The space inside the magnetosphere is protected from radiation from the Sun, our closest star. It has a low level of electrically charged particles. === Interplanetary space === Interplanetary space is the space around the Sun and planets of the Solar System. It has the solar wind, a continuous stream of charged particles from the Sun. This stream creates a very thin atmosphere (the Heliosphere) for 1,000,000,000s of miles or kilometers into space. Interplanetary space has the magnetic field generated by the Sun.Papagiannis, Michael D. 1972. ''Space physics and space astronomy''. Taylor & Francis, 12–149. Planets such as Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury (planet) and the Earth also have Magnetospheres. These magnetic fields can trap particles from the solar wind and other sources, creating belts of magnetic particles such as the Van Allen radiation belt. The solar wind gradually strips off the atmospheres of planets without magnetic fields, like Mars.Johnson R.E. 1994. Plasma-induced sputtering of an atmosphere. ''Space Science Reviews'' '''69''' (3–4): 215–253. [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF02101697] === Interstellar space === Interstellar space is the physical space in a galaxy that is not occupied by stars or their planetary systems. It continues to the edges of the galaxy, where it fades into the Void (astronomy). Most of the mass in this space is made up of single hydrogen atoms, fewer helium Atom and a few heavier atoms formed in stars. Supernovae blow some of their atoms huge distances. A number of Molecule and tiny 0.1 μm dust particles do exist in interstellar space.Rauchfuss, Horst 2008. ''Chemical evolution and the origin of life''. transl. T.N. Mitchell. Springer, p101. About four new types of molecules are discovered each year. Large regions of higher-density matter known as molecular clouds allow chemical reactions to occur. This includes organic polyatomic species. Much of this chemistry is driven by collisions. === Intergalactic space === Intergalactic space does have 'cosmic void (astronomy)' between the large-scale structures of the universe. == Exploration == Exploring space by direct travel is difficult, and more or less impossible beyond the near planets. Space contains no air beyond the Earth. Manned spacecraft are designed to keep air inside them and to protect astronauts from extreme temperatures. It takes three days of travelling to reach the Moon and, depending on speed, it would take a very long time to reach the closest star (Proxima Centauri). Radiation also endangers human life. Many people are skeptical that humans will ever travel beyond the near planets. === Telescopes === We gain most of our information about the items in space from different kinds of telescopes. Some of them are Space observatory, put in outer space for a better view. Space probes also explore planets, comets and other space objects that are not too distant. == Related pages == * Space-time * Black hole * Galaxy * Universe * Astronomy == References == Category:Astrophysics Category:Outer space
