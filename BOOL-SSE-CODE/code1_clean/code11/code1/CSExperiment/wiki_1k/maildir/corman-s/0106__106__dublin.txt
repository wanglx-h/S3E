In 2022, there were over 2.13 million people living in the Greater Dublin Area. Dublin was built by the Vikings upon the river Liffey. The river divides the city into two parts, North Dublin and South Dublin. Many famous writers lived in Dublin. Oscar Wilde and George Bernard Shaw were born in Dublin. James Joyce is probably Dublin's best known and most international writer. Dublin is home to Ireland's largest stadium for all sports, Croke Park. It can hold up to 85,000 people. Croke Park is the usual venue for all Ireland hurling and Gaelic football finals. The Aviva Stadium hosts rugby and soccer. ==Notes== ==References== == Other websites == * [http://reflectingcity.com/ "The Reflecting City"] * [http://www.dubchamber.ie/Uploads/Policy.pdf Dublin GDP stats] * [http://www.wikimapia.org/#y=53330000&x=-6250000&z=11&l=1&m=a WikiSatellite view of Dublin at WikiMapia] * [http://www.dublinblog.ie The Dublin Community Blog] * [http://www.travelingluck.com/Europe/Ireland/Dublin/-1502554_Dublin.html Satellite map of Dublin] - Including local geographic features. * [http://www.viajardublin.com/ Dublin] - Tourist information.
