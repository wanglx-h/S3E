It is the sixth smallest country in the world[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/dyb/dyb2006/Table03.pdf Population by sex, rate of population increase, surface area and density] and, with Uzbekistan, one of only two doubly Landlocked country countries. This means that it is bordered only by landlocked countries. Liechtenstein is located between Austria and Switzerland. The official language in Liechtenstein is German language. The capital of Liechtenstein is Vaduz, a very small town of 5,000 people. Liechtenstein is famous for its many private banks. Liechtenstein is known as a principality. This means that the monarch has the title of Prince. == History == The territory that is now Liechtenstein was once split into two different State, the County of Vaduz and the Lordship of Schellenberg, which were both part of the Holy Roman Empire. The House of Liechtenstein wanted more power within the Holy Roman Empire. In the 17th century, the Holy Roman Emperor made Karl Liechtenstein a Prince. Karl's descendant, Hans Adam I, Prince of Liechtenstein Purchase the lands of the County of Vaduz and the Lordship of Schellenberg and Union them into one principality named Liechtenstein. In 1806, the Holy Roman Empire was broken up by Napoleon. With the fall of the Empire, Liechtenstein became a free Sovereign state. Liechtenstein remained neutral during World War I and World War II. Adolf Hitler did have plans to invade Liechtenstein alongside Switzerland in the planned Operation Tannenbaum but never did. In 1969, NASA gave Liechtenstein moon and a Flag of Liechtenstein that had been on the moon to thank them for their support from a Liechtenstein company during the Apollo 11 mission. == Geography == Liechtenstein is located in the Alps and is bordered to the east by the Austrian state of Vorarlberg, to the south by the canton of Graubünden (Switzerland) and to the west by the canton of Canton of St. Gallen (Switzerland). The Rhine River forms the entire western border of Liechtenstein. Measured south to north the country is about 24 km (15 mi) long. Its highest point, the Grauspitz, is 2,599 m (8,527 ft). Despite its Alpine location, prevailing southerly winds make the climate comparatively mild. In winter, the mountain slopes are well suited to winter sports. == Politics == Liechtenstein is a constitutional monarchy, meaning that the head of state is a monarch (with the title Prince Regnant) but has limited political powers. The Prince can veto Legislation, call for a referendum, create new Bill (proposed law) and dissolve parliament. The legislature is the landtag (or Diet (assembly)). There are 25 Election members. The members of government are usually all members of the biggest political party. ==Related pages== *Liechtenstein at the Olympics *Liechtenstein national football team *List of rivers of Liechtenstein ==References== Category:Liechtenstein Category:Current monarchies Category:German-speaking countries Category:1866 establishments in Europe
