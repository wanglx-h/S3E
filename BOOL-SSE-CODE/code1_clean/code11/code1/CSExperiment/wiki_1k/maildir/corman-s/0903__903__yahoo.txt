In April 1994, "Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web" was renamed "Yahoo!", for which the backronym is "Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle".

Its URL was akebono.stanford.edu/yahoo. Yang says of their selection of the name, "We thought it fit well with what we were doing. It was irreverent. It was reflective of the Wild West nature of the Internet. A lot of people found it easy to remember, and besides, it's exactly what me and Jerry are. A couple of yahoos." ==Related pages== * Google * MSN * Ask.com == References == == Other websites == *[http://www.yahoo.com Yahoo! official website] *[http://everything.yahoo.com Everything Yahoo!] Category:American search engines Category:Internet-related organizations
