:''"WP:A" redirects here. You may be looking for Wikipedia:Announcements'' File:Wikipedia Administrator.svg, as administrators are often linked to janitors.]] '''Administrators''', also called '''admins''' or '''sysops''' ('''sys'''tem '''op'''erators), are users who can use special Special:ListGroupRights/Admin that help keep Wikipedia running well. They can use these tools because they are trusted by the community, but this does not make them better or more important than anybody else. The opinion of an administrator, for example, should not be counted as more important than the opinion of a person who chooses to change Wikipedia with an IP address just because they have administrator rights. ''There are currently -1}} administrators.'' == Administrative tools == === Delete === They can Wikipedia:Deletion policy and undelete pages. Pages can be deleted because of a WP:RFD or they can be Wikipedia:Deletion policy#Quick deletion under policy. Undeletion requests should be made at Wikipedia:Deletion review. ====Revision Delete==== Administrators can also hide Help:Diff of a page from public view by deleting them. Only other administrators can see the deleted revisions. Revisions should only be hidden in special cases, listed Wikipedia:Deletion_policy#Revision deletion. === Protect === They can Wikipedia:Protection policy, unprotect and change protected pages, including those in the :en:Wikipedia:MediaWiki namespace, and other users' personal JavaScript or Cascading Style Sheets (.js or .css) files. * Requests for protection can be made at Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard. Please remember that pages are usually protected when there is WP:VAND or an WP:edit war happening, and not to prevent vandalism that has not happened. === Block === Administrators can Wikipedia:Blocks and bans and unblock users who are causing trouble. * Requests should be made at Wikipedia:Vandalism in progress but only if the user has been disruptive. Requests made in Wikipedia:Assume good faith may result in you being blocked. Blocks are different than bans. === Rollback === File:Wikipedia Rollbacker.svg They can Wikipedia:Rollback. This lets them quickly undo all the changes by a user to a page if they are the newest changes. The change is automatically marked as a Help:small change and gives the following WP:Change summary: :'''m''' Help:Revert_a_page edits by Special:Contributions/User A (User_talk:User A) to last version by User B To use bot rollback, you type in the URL http://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&target=Example&bot=1 replacing Example with the user name, and then you can rollback changes and hide them from the recent changes along with the rolled back edit, but this should only be used for large amounts of vandalism, like with a :m:vandalbot. * Users can also be given the rollback tool. You can make requests at WP:RFRB. === Import pages === They can meta:Import pages from other Wikipedias. === View unwatched pages === They can see which pages are not on anyone's watchlist. === Manage user rights === They can give some user rights to others. They can add or remove rollback, IP block exempt, flooder, the uploader right, and the patroller rights for all accounts. == Bureaucrats == File:Wikipedia bureaucrat.svg '''Bureaucrats''' can do a few more things than an administrator, but they should only use these while acting on WP:CON. Bureaucrats can give administrator or bureaucrat rights to other users, following a successful request on Wikipedia:Requests for permissions. On the Simple English Wikipedia, bureaucrats can also remove administrator status following a successful request for removal of rights (deadminship), or in certain emergency situations for protection of the wiki. They can also "flag" and un-flag Wikipedia:Bot, which means to hide their contributions from the new changes and to put them in the bot group. Bureaucrats were previously able to help users who want to :meta:Changing username. These requests were handled on Wikipedia:Changing username. However, the ability to rename users has been removed from bureaucrats for :m:SUL finalization. Now, these requests should be made at :m:SRUC or on this Special:GlobalRenameRequest where stewards and global renamers will handle them. == CheckUsers == File:Wikipedia Checkuser.svg A select few administrators are also '''CheckUsers'''. Users with CheckUser access can see the IP addresses of named editors. They can also see which users edit from certain IP addresses, as well as some information on the web browser used for editing. There are many rules as to who can become a CheckUser, and how CheckUsers have to behave. These rules are listed on the m:CheckUser policy page. CheckUsers can help fight vandalism and WP:Sock puppetry this way. CheckUser requests can be made at Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser. Presently, there are CheckUsers. See Special:ListUsers/checkuser for an automatically generated list. == Oversighters == File:Wikipedia Oversight (2020).png Certain administrators are also '''Oversighters'''. Page :en:Help:Diff can be hidden or removed from the public history so they can only be seen by other oversighters, m:Stewards, and :m:System administrators; users with oversight access can hide revisions so that only these users can see them. The right is a sensitive one, and removes private data that can cause legal problems. There are many rules as to who can become an oversighter, and how oversighters have to behave. These rules are listed on the m:Oversight page. Oversighters can help fight wp:VAN this way. Oversighter requests should only be made privately, and not on Wikipedia. See the WP:OS page. == List of administrators == :''An automated list of accounts with administrator rights is available at Special:ListAdmins.'' {| style=background:transparent width=100% | width=49% valign=top | === Active === * * * * * * * * * * * * | width=2% | | width=49% valign=top | === Semi-active === * * * * * * * |} {| class="navbox collapsible collapsed nowraplinks" style="margin:auto" !colspan=2 style="text-align:center;width:100%;"|Inactive administrators |- | width=50% valign=top align=left| * 31 December 2024 * 25 February 2025 | width=50% valign=top align=left| * 4 January 2025 |} {| class="navbox collapsible collapsed nowraplinks" style="margin:auto" !colspan=2 style="text-align:center;width:100%;"|Former administrators |- | width=50% valign=top align=left| * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * | width=50% valign=top align=left| * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * |} == Requesting administrator, bureaucrat, checkuser, or oversighter rights == Users who want to request administrator, bureaucrat, checkuser, or oversighter rights can do this at Wikipedia:Requests for permissions.
