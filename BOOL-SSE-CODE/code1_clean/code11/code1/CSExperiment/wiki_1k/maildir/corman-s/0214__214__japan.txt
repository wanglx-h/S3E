It is a group of islands close to the east coast of Korea, China and Russia. The Pacific Ocean is to the east of Japan and the Sea of Japan is to the west. Most people in Japan live on one of the four islands. The biggest of these islands, Honshu, has the most people. Honshu is the 7th largest island in the world. Tokyo is the capital city of Japan and its biggest city. File:Japan_Exclusive_Economic_Zones.png:]] The Japanese people call their country "Nihon" or "Nippon", which means "the origin of the Sun" in Japanese. Japan is a monarchy whose head of state is called the Emperor of Japan. Japan is the oldest monarchy in the world, lasting more than 2,000 years. ==History== File:Emperor_Jimmu.jpg]] The first people in Japan were the Ainu people and other Jōmon period. They were closely related to Europeans or Mongols. They were later conquered and replaced by the Yayoi period (early Japanese and Ryukyuans). The Yayoi were an ancient ethnic group that migrated to the Japanese archipelago mainly from China during the Yayoi period (300 CE–300 AD). Modern Japanese people have primarily Yayoi ancestry at an average of 97%.https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/03/15/579177.full.pdf The indigenous Ryukyuan people and Ainu people peoples have more Jōmon ancestry on the other hand. The earliest records on Japan are from China documents. One of those records said there were many small countries (in Japan) which had wars between them and later a country, ruled by a queen, became the strongest, unified others, and brought peace. The Japanese began to write their own history after the 5th century and 6th century, when people from Korea and China taught Japan about the Chinese writing system. Japan's neighbors also taught them Buddhism. The Japanese changed Buddhism in many ways. For example, Japanese Buddhists used ideas such as Zen more than other Buddhists. Japan had some contact with the Europeans in the 16th century. The Portugal were the first Europeans to visit Japan. Later, the Spain and Holland came to Japan to trade. Also, they brought Christianity. Japan's leaders welcomed them at first, but because Europeans had conquered many places in the world, the Japanese were scared they would conquer Japan too. So the Japanese did not let the Europeans come into Japan anymore, except in a small area in Nagasaki city. Many Christians were killed. Only the Chinese, Korean, and Dutch people were allowed to visit Japan, in the end, and they were under careful control of the Japanese government. Japan was opened for visitors again in 1854 by Commodore Matthew C. Perry, when the United States wanted to use Japanese ports for American whale boats. Perry brought steamships with guns, which scared the Japanese into making an agreement with him. File:Chikamatsu_Kiken_buto_no_ryakuke.jpg in Japan]] File:Ceremony_for_the_Promulgation_of_the_Constitution_by_Wada_Eisaku.jpg This new contact with Europeans and Americans changed the Japanese culture. The Meiji Restoration of 1868 stopped some old ways and added many new ones. The Empire of Japan was created, and it became a very powerful nation and tried to invade the countries next to it. File:Generals_Pyongyang_MigitaToshihide_October1894.jpg.]] It invaded and annexation Ryukyu Islands Kingdom, Taiwan, and Korea. It had wars with China and Russia: the First Sino-Japanese War, the Boxer Rebellion, the Russo-Japanese War, World War I and Siberian Intervention. In 1918, World War I allowed Japan, which joined the side of the victorious Allies of World War I, to capture German Empire in the Pacific and in China. The Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945) grew to become a part of World War II when Japan became allies with Nazi Germany and Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946). In 1941, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, and destroyed or damaged many ships and airplanes of the United States. This started the United States' involvement in World War II. American and Japanese forces fought each other in the Pacific. The Americans captured most of the islands in the Pacific, started dropping bombs on Japanese cities, and prepared to invade. File:Japanese_Empire_(orthographic_projection).svg (1942)]] To make Japan surrender, the United States dropped two atomic bombs on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing 150,000 Japanese citizens. Soon after this the Soviet Union began to fight against Japan, and the Japanese army in Manchuria lost. Japan surrendered and gave up all the places it took from other countries, accepting the Potsdam Conference Proclamation. The United States occupied Japan from September 1945 to April 1952 and forced it to write a new constitution, in which it promised to never go to war again. Japan was granted membership in the United Nations in 1956. A Japanese economic miracle propelled Japan to become the second-largest economy in the world. On 11 March 2011, Japan suffered one of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, triggering the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. On 1 May 2019, after the historic Akihito#Abdication, his son Naruhito became Emperor, beginning the Reiwa period era. On 8 July 2022, former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was Assassination of Shinzo Abe while giving a campaign speech in Nara, Nara. ==Geography== Japan is a group of islands in the Western Pacific, off the coast of China. The four biggest islands are Honshu, Hokkaido, Shikoku, and Kyushu, and there are about 6,000 smaller islands there. Japan is separated from the Asian continent by the Sea of Japan and the East China Sea. Honshu, which means 'Mainland' in the Japanese language, is the biggest island. Hokkaido is the island north of Honshu. Kyushu is the island west of Honshu. Shikoku is the island to the south-west of Honshu. In the middle of Japan there are mountains. They cover the middle of the islands and leave a very narrow strip of flat land on most coasts. Many of the mountains are extinct volcanoes, but some are still active. The highest of these mountains is the beautiful, volcano-shaped Mt Fuji (3,776metres or 12,389feet high). Japan has many earthquakes, in fact there are about 1500 of these every year. The biggest earthquake recorded in Japan was in 2011 - called '2011 Tohoku Earthquake'. It caused great damage to several power plants forcing Japan to shut down all its nuclear plants. There was nuclear core meltdown which caused a serious health risk to nearby villages and cities. 90% of the people living in Japan live in just 10% of the land, near the coast. The other 10% of the people in Japan live away from the coast. File:Skyscrapers of Shinjuku 2009 January.jpg]] Over 10 cities have more than a million people in them. The biggest city in Japan is Tokyo, which is the capital. ==Science and technology== Japan has made many contributions to science and technology.

Noodles and tofu are also common. Sushi, a Japanese food made of cooked rice with vinegar with other ingredients such as raw fish, and sometimes fried shrimp, is popular around the world. The religion in Japan is mostly Shinto and Buddhist. Due to the tolerant nature of the two main Japanese religions, and the resulting intermixing of the two, many Japanese identify as both Shinto and Buddhist at the same time. There are small numbers of Christians and Hindus, and a few Jews. When it comes to popular culture, Japan is famous for making video games. Many of the biggest companies that make games, like Nintendo, Namco, and Sega, are Japanese. Other well-known parts of Japanese arts are its comics, called manga, and its digital animation, known as anime.

These days, Japan is competing for at least 4 different territories. It cannot agree with some neighboring countries on whether the land belongs to Japan or the other country. * Senkaku Islands problem (with China and Taiwan) * Liancourt Rocks island problem (with South Korea) * Southern Chishima Islands problem (with Russia) * Sea of Japan problem (with South Korea and North Korea) ==Public transportation== File:JR Central Shinkansen 700.jpg or ''Bullet trains'' are a common form of transportation in Japan.]] There are several important international airports in Japan.
