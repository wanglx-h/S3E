Subject: Mixture
In chemistry, a '''mixture''' is a substance that is made up of two or more simpler substances. These substances can be chemical elements or Chemical compound. A mixture can be made of liquids, solids, or gases. ==Characteristics== A mixture is not the same as a Chemical compound which is made of two or more atoms connected together. For instance, a mixture of the gases hydrogen and nitrogen contains hydrogen and nitrogen, not the compound ammonia which is made of hydrogen and nitrogen atoms. A mixture where the different parts can be distinguished easily is called ''heterogenous'', one where this is not the case is called ''homogeneous''. A third form is called colloid. If one substance in a mixture dissolution in the other, it is called a solution. For example, if sugar is put in water it forms a mixture, then dissolves to make a solution. If it does not dissolve, it would be called a suspension (chemistry). Solids can be mixtures also. Alloys are mixtures. Many kinds of soil and mineral are mixtures of different minerals. Thus, a mixture is made of two or more elements and/or compounds which are not chemically combined. ==Gallery== File:Red Wine Glass.jpg|Red wine in a glass, a homogeneous mixture.
