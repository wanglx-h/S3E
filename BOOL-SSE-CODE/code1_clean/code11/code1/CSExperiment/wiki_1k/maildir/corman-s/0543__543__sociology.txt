Sociologists also interview people or hold group discussions to find out why people behave in certain ways. Some sociologists combine different research methods. == History of sociology == Social analysis has been done since the time of Plato. However, sociology was not accepted as a type of science until the early 1800s. At the time, Europe cities were Industrialisation and changing drastically. Many people moved into cities and began working in Factory. Sociologists tried to understand how people and groups interacted in these reorganized societies. Themes included community, authority, Social status, alienation and lack of power. The word "sociology" was invented by French thinker Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyès in 1780. Early thinkers who wrote about sociology included Auguste Comte and Max Weber. Sociology was taught as a university subject for the first time at the University of Kansas in 1890. A few years after, in 1895, Émile Durkheim founded the first European department of sociology at the University of Bordeaux. The first sociology department to be established in United Kingdom was at the London School of Economics and Political Science in 1904. In 1919, a sociology department was established in Germany at the Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich by Max Weber. == Related pages == * Political economy * Anthropology * Social philosophy * Social psychology * Social sciences * Social structure * Sociolinguistics * Sociological imagination * Structural functionalism * Marxism == Further reading == * Babbie, Earl R. 2003.
