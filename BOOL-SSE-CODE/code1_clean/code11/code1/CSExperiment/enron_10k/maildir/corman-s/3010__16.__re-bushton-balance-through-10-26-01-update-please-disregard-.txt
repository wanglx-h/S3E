 previous Bushton Report for 26th!
Thanks, you might look at 10/27 also. It looks like this day is off the other way (too high). Thanks.

I talked to Steve in NNG Gas Control to see why we had such a difference in the PVR Shrink for the 26th. He is showing the volume for the PVR measured @ 96.7 which would be only a 2,481 difference and make the monthly only 4,654 difference. I also went out into PGAS and confirmed the volume measured was indeed 96.7 dth. Apparently we have an issue between PGAS and the TMS system. I will get with Harry, the PGAS group, and the TMS in the morning to see if we can figure out what is going on. So please disregard the Bushton Report for the 26th.
