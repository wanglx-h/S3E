I just looked at myu schedule and I have to work neew years eve during the day and I don't know yet about new years day.. It really isn't that big of a deal to me. The important thing for me right now is spending my free time to go down and spend time with my sister so I could kind of care less about going to the Beavers Bowl game when I can just watch it on TV. I mean it would be nice to go but it is not the slightest bit a priority for me right now. So are you and dave seeing each other exclusively or are you dating other people?
