You will be accessing Outlook for all of your email functions. WHY IS ENRON MIGRATING TO OUTLOOK 2000? Many factors contributed to the decision to migrate from Lotus Notes to Microsoft Exchange/Outlook. The most prominent factors were: ? Significant advantages to moving to a product that is more integrated with current Enron apps (Windows 2000, Office and Internet Explorer) ? More efficient Shared PC and Roaming User features ? Improved support and integration for Palm/CE devices ? Instant Messaging capabilities WHAT IS BEING MIGRATED TO OUTLOOK 2000? ? Email Messages. From the date of your scheduled migration, the last (30) thirty days of your Email will be converted for use in Outlook. ? All your folders in Notes you use to store email messages in. ? To Do Items ? Journal Items ? Calendar Entries dating from (1) one year in the past to (10) ten years in the future will be converted. ? Address Books, but NOT your Distribution Lists that you created. You will need to re-create these in Outlook. Thank you, Outlook 2000 Migration Team
