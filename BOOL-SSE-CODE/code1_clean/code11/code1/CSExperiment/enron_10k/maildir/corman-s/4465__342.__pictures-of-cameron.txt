Hello, girls. If Stacey can do it, so can I! Here are the latest pictures of Cameron. These were taken right before the Baptism of my sister's third (can you believe it??) child, so he is all dressed up. I hope all is well with everyone. Love, Michelle ---------------------- Forwarded by Michelle Cash/HOU/ECT on 09/08/2000 04:55 PM --------------------------- Trey Cash@ENRON 09/04/2000 10:20 PM To: Michelle Cash/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Pictures of Cameron
