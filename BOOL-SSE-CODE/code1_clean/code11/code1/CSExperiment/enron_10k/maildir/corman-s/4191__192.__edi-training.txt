Subject: EDI Training
Every Friday in October and November, Jim Studebaker and I will facilitate an EDI discussion for customer service reps working the weekend. Please attend this EDI training on Friday, October 19 from 2:30-3:00 in EB3907. The discussion will include a review of the TMS quick response and diagnostic tool screens and the Team EDI web page. Questions related to EDI and problem resolution will also be discussed. Beverly, please provide me a telephone number where you can be reached. We look forward to seeing you at the meeting.
