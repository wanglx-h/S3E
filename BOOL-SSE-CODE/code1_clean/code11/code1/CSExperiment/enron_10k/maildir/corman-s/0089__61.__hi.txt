Subject: hi-
as promised some z6 vs ho spread for q1..against NG east storage stocks.... some of our guys looking at the z6 premium as a bit to high with the winter outlook not being that cold for the N/E...ie 1.90 for jan and feb plus gas daily/physical permium of 40 cents! and storage at these lvls.... recent 11-15 day supporting the term basis - but if you dont think the weather will sustain...then how much premium does the z6 deserve....? hope these help..richard (associate here with us) has put together a bunch of historicals on the stocks etc...so let me know what else you want to take a look at...
