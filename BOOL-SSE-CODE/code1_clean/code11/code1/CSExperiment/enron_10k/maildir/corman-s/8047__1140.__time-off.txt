Subject: Time off
Bill, I have some family business that I need to attend to in April. I therefore need, March 31st thru April 3rd off from work. It is only four days so I assume it will not be a problem. I already have March 31st off so if you could just make sure that I have April 1st thru 3rd off also it would be greatly appreciated. I am going to book my ticket tommorow evening to take advantage of a good fare so please let me know if there is a problem by then. Thanks.
