Michelle, I took advantage of the long weekend and wanted to share this good news with you first because you have been supportive of my digital endeavors. Color me excited! My digital waterfall electronic storefront is open for business. You may have seen some of the images in the Oregon 2000 vacation report on my personal web site. I've placed the best of the lot for viewing and purchase on the new storefront site. The address is: http://nwdigifalls.homestead.com Come linger awhile. I think you will enjoy a tour of the gallery. The images are magnificent! Michelle, don't worry about purchasing; just enjoy the views. I wanted to show off my web design skills and share these delightful waterfall images with you.
