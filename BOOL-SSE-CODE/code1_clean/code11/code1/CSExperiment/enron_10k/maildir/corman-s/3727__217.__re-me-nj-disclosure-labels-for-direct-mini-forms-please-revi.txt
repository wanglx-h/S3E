Subject: Re: ME & NJ disclosure labels for direct mini forms -- PLEASE
 REVIEW
Sandy: I'm still very concerned about the NJ aspect of things - I was under the impression we are not going physical until 2003 in NJ. Rebecca - can you confirm this for me? If we are indeed continuing onward with this direct marketing campaign (and it is for a physical product) is everyone on the business side (back office) in on the loop? Otherwise, I will take a look at ME - Richard - I presume the cost again came from the same type of calculations that you threw together for Mass? Sandy - what changes should I make to our current label overall (not necessarily for the Direct Mini) based upon your research that still apply to our current customers?

The NJ label was adapted from Exhibit C of the NJBPU's posted Environmental Standards http://www.bpu.state.nj.us/wwwroot/energy/envi.PDF using emissions and resource data from system power. Please review and run it by your commercial team as well. The ME label is adapted from the version you forwarded to me on Friday. As this is a fixed price product, similar changes were made to the language under "Generation Price" as were made in MA. As this product does not have the excess and deficiency usage bands, EESI is not required to list language from the Maine Rules that explains price variability (as is the case in with the label you are currently using). I've placed the product name in the title of the label so that you will be able to differentiate it from the other product(s). The only other changes I made were (i) removal of the triangles under "Air Emissions" that appear to be a carry-over from the MA label; the unit specific symbols are not required on the ME label; (ii) the footnote for "Power Sources" has been moved from the bottom of the page to directly under the power sources table; and (iii) removal of the bracket on the second page under "Power Sources". Please review and let me know if you have any questions or comments about the changes I've made. Also, please confirm that the data reflected (for example, the 5.08 cents under avg price per kWh) is current. Thanks for your help.
