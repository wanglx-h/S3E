Subject: FW: Data Correction - Lianne Lami
Michelle, The mole hill appears to have grown into a mountain. I asked Alisa Petteway to communicate to Judy Gray to contact Kathy and/or you, if necessary on this matter as I have exhausted my ability to effectively communicate "why changing the data is not prudent or historically accurate", as well as the fact that I have not received any other document that demonstrates a reason to correct the data for 1/1/2000 through 2/1/2000. The title change did occur subsequent to the salary increase.
