Subject: PJM FTRs
I spoke with Aaron Baseman at PJM today. The Network External Non-Designated transmission service does not give us access to FTRs. The only ways to secure eligibility for FTRs are to (1) secure unit-specific ICAP resources, or (2) purchase Firm Point-to-Point transmission on a long-term basis. We therefore will want to cancel our previous Network transmission request and pursue the previously discussed alternatives.
