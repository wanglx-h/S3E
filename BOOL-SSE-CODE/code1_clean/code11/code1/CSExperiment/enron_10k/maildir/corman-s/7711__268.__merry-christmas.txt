Subject: Merry christmas
Wishing you both a very nice Christmas! I understand Houston is to get some very cold weather in the next couple days! Well that will be very similar to up here in the north country! Hope all is well. Sheila -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net)
