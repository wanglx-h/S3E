Subject: POD/POR acronyms
As was handed out in the RT meeting............ I have a new fun one for all of you.............. the correct (in theory!) POD/POR E-Tag acronyms for the entire WSCC. The attached sheet has the entire list as well as a short list that I have created. The short list contains most of the points that we use in RT. Get to know them well. Enjoy! Cheers, Jesse
