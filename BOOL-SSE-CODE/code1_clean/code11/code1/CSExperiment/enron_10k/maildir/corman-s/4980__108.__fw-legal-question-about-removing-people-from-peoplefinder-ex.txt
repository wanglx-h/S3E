Subject: FW: Legal Question about Removing People from
 Peoplefinder/Expertfinder
Alan, I understand that you have approved the request below. Is this because they are WRA personnel? Thanks. Michelle -----Original Message----- : High Hi Michelle, please see below. Should I just take this for face value or inquire as to why? I've only been asked to take off 1 person for harrassment before. This just seems strange getting a list of people without any explaination. -----Original Message----- From: Deleon, Roberto Sent: Thu 6/7/2001 3:58 PM To: Schultea, Kathryn Cc: Subject: Removal from People/Expert Finder Kathryn, I need to have the following individuals removed from both People & Expert Finder.
