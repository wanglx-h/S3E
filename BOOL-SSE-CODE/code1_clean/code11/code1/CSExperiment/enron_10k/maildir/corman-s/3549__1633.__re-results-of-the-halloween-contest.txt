Subject: Re: Results of the Halloween Contest!
Touche' Clearly those in power are interested in one thing--preserving their privileged position and the status quo. My opponent is for big lycra. I don't trust big lycra. I trust the people, and their own ears. I will make a pledge right now that if I am selected to win next year in advance, I will NOT wear camouflage lycra on Halloween. (This pledge alone should ensure my victory). Furthermore, since my worthy opponent nearly had to pass out earplugs as a form of defense against the colorful nature of his costume, I think he should be the last to make allegations regarding "visual impairment." Is that what "visions and values" is all about? Jeff Shields 11/02/2000 11:48 AM To: Debra Davidson/PDX/ECT@ECT cc: Portland West Desk Subject: Re: Results of the Halloween Contest! I for one believed the judging to be objective and fair. Clearly, "price caps" are out of favor. Enron's totally impartial judges, and FERC's independent analysis, reached the same (appropriate) conclusion. As for fatigues, they are difficult to see, so how can one expect to be evaluated on a costume that is visually disadvantaged. The foundation of Enron's business is competition. Obviously, the exceptional wisdom of the independent judges recognized that cycling is a highly competitive activity. Therefor, a cycling costume reflected the spirit of Enron and the Halloween competition. My suggestion to Mr. Rasmussen for next years competition is that he wear lycra camouflage.
