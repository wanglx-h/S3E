David, I believe the agreement was signed. It would have been a Corporate Services Agreement. I believe that Shonnie Daniel or Steve Van Hooser worked on this. I have cc'd this email to them so that they can provide you with a copy, forward it on to the appropriate person, or let me know if one never was signed, in which case I can prepare a new version. Thanks. Michelle Enron Capital Management From: David Baumbach 10/20/2000 09:27 AM To: Michelle Cash/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Bridgeline I was given your name by Steve Venturatos. He said that you were involved in getting a Master Agreement set up so that Enron would supply a Risk team to take care of that function for Bridgeline. I talked with Trevor Mihalik and he believes that an agreement was never signed. Can you help me determine if there is an agreement in place and if not can we get one created? Dave Baumbach
