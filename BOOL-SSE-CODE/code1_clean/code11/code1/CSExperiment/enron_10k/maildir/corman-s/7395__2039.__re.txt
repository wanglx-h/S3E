yeah I found out later in the week that you guys were gone. Sounds like you had a great time! I love Italy. that place is so awesome. I was over there about the same time of year in 93 and it was great because there was less tourists and it was a little cheaper but the weather was still pretty good. You will have to tell me about it next time I see you. So I am going down to the Beaver game on Saturday but i might go down to Eugene and hang out with Wilson tommorow night. I will probably decide tonight but if I don't I would be into grabbing a few beers with you tommorow night after work.
