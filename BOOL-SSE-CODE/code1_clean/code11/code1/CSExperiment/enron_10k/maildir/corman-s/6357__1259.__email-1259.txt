Hey Guz what's up I was cleaning out my room and came across your biz card and thought that I'd give you a look see. What's new? Are you going to the Seafood and wine festival I hear all the kids are going this year. Not much happening on my end. Graduated from OSU and I'm currently looking for a job. I'm also living at Geoff's house so if you want to give me a call you can catch me at 503 293-9071. Lates.
