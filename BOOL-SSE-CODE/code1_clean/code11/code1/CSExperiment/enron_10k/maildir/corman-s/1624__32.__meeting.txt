Shelly Thanks for sharing the infomation in the meeting this morning. I realize these are uncertian times, but now I feel a bit more positive about things. I am not a meeting person. but in these times it is good to be informed. If the morning is too difficult for you, maybe you could have the meeting at the 6:00 pm crew change. Thanks and look forward to working with you with the challenges that we face. Thomas
