Subject: Security
With the recent events and increased security at Enron, safety has become a major concern in our daily routines at work. We experienced an unfortunate incident of theft and would like everyone be aware of the unusual activity and traffic flow in your area. Please note people tagging in with you on your badge with no badge or identification (guest sticker). The internal doors to the freight elevators should be closed/locked at all times. If these doors are open, this is allows open access to the floor. If you notice unusual activity, please contact Corporate Security at x36200 immediately. Thank you.
