Subject: RE: Morning meeting-OBA report
Tim, Is the activity at the MidLouisiana points normal. How did we build up a 156,000 MMBtu balance at Port Hudson. Is this a measurement or a scheduling mismatch? How big is this point? -----Original Message----- From: Cooper, Tim Sent: Tuesday, February 26, 2002 7:37 AM To: Dowden Jr., Jimmy; Swanson, Dan; Long, John; Nestor II, Thomas; Nelson, Beverley; Craig, Rick; Hayes, Robert; Boatman, Jack; Cady, Rachel; Farrell, Sharon; Corman, Shelley; Nacey, Sheila; Bryant, Mike; Bellard, Dannis; Kilmer III, Robert Subject: Morning meeting-OBA report Please find the attached.
