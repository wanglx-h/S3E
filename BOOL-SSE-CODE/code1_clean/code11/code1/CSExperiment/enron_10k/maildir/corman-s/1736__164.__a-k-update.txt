Subject: A&K update
I just received another voice mail from Teresa, indicating that she would like to tell A&K yes. The idea would be that the firm would get the employees to agree that if a dispute arises in the future, the A&K lawyers would not represent either side. That would address the future litigation issue, though probably not the other issues. --Lizzette
