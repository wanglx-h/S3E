Subject: RE: Immigration Q&As
Yes, Terrie James will coordinate that effort. I am, however, working with Simone Lewis to coordinate the publication of the immigration Q&As on Livelink. I am hopeful that this information will be published today by 1:30 p.m. Simone will send an e-mail to the HR Generalists informing them that the information is available on Livelink. Thanks, Cole. -----Original Message----- From: Daffin, Margaret Sent: Monday, November 19, 2001 11:10 AM To: Brown, Cole; James, Terrie Cc: Cash, Michelle; Palmer, Lizzette; Jones, Robert W.- HR Exec Subject: RE: Immigration Q&As Sensitivity: Confidential Cole: will all employees be notified that there will be an update to the Q&A's, as I believe it is important to do so?
