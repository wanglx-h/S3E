Hi Shelley, We were at Tracey and Rex's for dinner this evening. Tracey told me about "Willie." I'm sorry about that but I know you said he was really getting old and feeble. It is very difficult, though, losing a pet. Bet poor "Wiley" is lost without his buddy. Let me know when you get your box of "goodies." Love, Mom
