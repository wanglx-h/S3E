Subject: 2001 Law Conference
Jim, As we discussed, I would like to have nominations for the CLE Planning Committee for the 2001 law conference identified before year end so that the committee will be able to meet in early January. Below is draft language for inclusion in an email from you to the general counsels of the various groups. The chair for the CLE Planning Committee for the 2001 Law Conference is Michelle Cash. Each business unit law department should have at least one representative on the CLE committee. The first CLE Planning Committee meeting will take place in early January; therefore, please give Michelle the name of your group's committee member by December 20. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ --------------------------- Michelle Cash Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith Street, EB 3823 Houston, Texas 77002 (713) 853-6401 michelle.cash@enron.com This message may contain confidential information that is protected by the attorney-client and/or work product privileges.
