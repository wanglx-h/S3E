Subject: Bridgeline
Hector, I met with David Baumbaugh today about Bridgeline. Apparently, we have sent Trey Logan over there to replace O'Neal Winfree. We thus need to do an assignment letter for Logan. Could you please provide me and Twanda with the particulars so that we can paper it up? Thanks. Michelle
