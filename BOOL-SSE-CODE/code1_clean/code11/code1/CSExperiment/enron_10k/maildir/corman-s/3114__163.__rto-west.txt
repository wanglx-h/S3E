I thought you might want to be the Tariff Integration group's liason to the Provisions/Requirements Content Group since that group is dealing with interconnection issues. You weren't at the meeting when the assignment came up so I said you might be interested in the assignment and that I would take responsibility for asking you if you wanted the job. Are you interested? I don't have your phone number. I'm at 503-464-8862.
