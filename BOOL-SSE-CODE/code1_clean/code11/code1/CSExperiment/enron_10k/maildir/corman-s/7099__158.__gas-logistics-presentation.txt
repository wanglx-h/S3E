Subject: Gas Logistics Presentation
Caroline Barnes has indicated that you have a presentation put together that briefly covers the purpose and function of Gas Logistics, and how this department interacts with other departments. I was wondering if you would be interested in making the presentation to GMS personnel to better understand how Measurement impacts your department. Please let me know if you have an interest and when you might be available and I'll arrange for the conference room to be available. Thanks- Gary
