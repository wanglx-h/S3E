Subject: RE: Hardware Purchases
Donna, in talking with Larry Stuard, he can give us a demonstration on the new blackberry devices if Jean does not have time. Just thought I would throw that out there if there is an interest. Thanks.

As soon as Jean gets her blackberry she will demonstrate the features of each device so you can determine what best fits your needs.
