Subject: Reminder about resources
All, I will have the finalized resource ID list from the PX next week. If a schedule ID is used for a new customer, it's important to notify Vol Mgt ASAP so we can change the database to correctly account for the charges BEFORE WE RUN THE FLASH AND GIVE P/L NUMBERS TO RISK. The list will let you know which IDs can be used for new customers. October was a pain to close, mostly because of this issue. This should be a non-issue starting November. Thanks, Brett
