Subject: RE: what doing?
I'm ok. Coming down with a cold so I feel like shit. Found out I got accepted to these apartments I wanted which is cool. I'm just a little stressed because move in costs are always a bitch. -----Original Message----- From: Mark.Guzman@enron.com [mailto:Mark.Guzman@enron.com] Sent: Wednesday, January 17, 2001 9:42 AM To: Katie.Trullinger@wfsg.com Subject: RE: what doing? Never mind. So anyway, I am totally worked right now. I went to the Blazer game with my friend Kate and we ended up going out afterward. i ended up staying out until 2am and I had to be in to work at 5:30. So basically my day is totally sucking. How are you doing?
