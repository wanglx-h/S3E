The melodic strains of an orchestra Wisping through the night, Remind me of another time, And so of a lovely sight. Remembrance such as these Flood my thoughts with rhyme And I can not help but long for The song of another time. A time when life made sense to me, When love was everywhere; When you and I would dance and dance While your fragrance filled the air. Such memories consume me, And they constantly remind; That you, my sweet, are in my heart And forever on my mind.
