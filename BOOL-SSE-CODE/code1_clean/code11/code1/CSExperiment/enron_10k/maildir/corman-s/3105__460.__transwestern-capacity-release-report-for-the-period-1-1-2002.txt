Subject: Transwestern Capacity Release Report for the period 1/1/2002 -
 12/31/2003
Attached is the Transwestern Capacity Release Report that lists all capacity release transactions for the period effective 1/1/2002. All transactions were awarded at 100% of the applicable maximum tariff rates. I have also been advised by Marketing that another posting may occur for January 2001 (partial month) but nothing has been finalized. I will send an updated file if necessary. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me. Thanks, Elizabeth
