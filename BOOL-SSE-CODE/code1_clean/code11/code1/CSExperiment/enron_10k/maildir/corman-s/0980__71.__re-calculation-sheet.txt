Subject: RE: Calculation Sheet
The 2 weeks is the amount of years of service, or the amount of 10K increments in salary. The 4 weeks is a premium on top of that amount. -----Original Message----- From: Palmer, Lizzette Sent: Friday, October 19, 2001 10:22 AM To: Huynh, Catherine Cc: Cash, Michelle Subject: Calculation Sheet Sensitivity: Confidential Cathy, The voluntary separation calculator asks for a number for 2 weeks pay. Should that be four weeks, or does the program take the 2 weeks and multiply it to arrive at the four weeks base pay number? If the latter, I can see it creating some confusion. If the calculation sheet needs to be set up that way, perhaps we should drop a note explaining. --Lizzette
