Subject: CAISO NOTICE: ISO 2001 Demand Program Update
Market Participants: The ISO provides this update regarding the Summer 2001 Demand Relief Program and the Discretionary Load Curtailment Program. The ISO intends to issue new solicitations for both programs in the next 1 1/2 weeks. Two additional RFBs for the Demand Relief Program, one for Loads only and one for Loads with back-up generators, are scheduled for issuance early next week with bids due May 1. They will be posted to our website and noticed by email. Based on ISO Governing Board approval on May 10, these Loads will begin participation in the Demand Relief Program on either June 1 or July 1, as feasible. The ISO Governing Board recently approved the design structure of the ISO Discretionary Load Curtailment Program. This program will be operable year-round. The ISO plans to issue the formal RFP in the next 1 1/2 weeks. Proposals will be accepted from aggregators on an ongoing basis. Additional details (subject to some change) can be found in Attachment A of the ISO Management Memo to the Governing Board dated March 7, 2001 and titled, Summer 2001 Preparedness Update and Demand Response Programs. (Note that pricing for the Discretionary Load Curtailment Program could be modified in the final design; the ISO expects to initiate the program in the $250-$500/MWh price range.)
