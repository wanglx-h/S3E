What up foolio? Just thought I would drop you a line and see how things are going in the city by the bay. Got your address from Sul at Monday nights softball game. Which we won. We haven't lost in this section of the fall league and are playing really good ball. Maybe it is our upgrade at first base. So I am still not sure if I will be able to come down for the Cal game or not. Right now I am kind of broke from all the flights to LA. I went and had a few beers with Cheryl last night. She called me up about 8:00 and I was bored so I decided to go with her. She got so fucking ass faced. Man that chick is a train wreck sometimes. So how is school? What kind of classes are you taking right now? You aren't going to convert into being a Giants fan while you are down there are you? Anyway drop me a line when you get a chance and let me know how everything is going. Oh by the way: Beavs update " We Suck!"
