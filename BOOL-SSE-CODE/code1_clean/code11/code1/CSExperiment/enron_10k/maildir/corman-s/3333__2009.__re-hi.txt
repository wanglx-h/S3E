Subject: RE: hi!
So, I saw Kristen last night. I was on my way to dinner with my friend Kim and Kristen was sitting outside at the 21st ave Bar and Grill. She acted like I was her long lost friend and then proceeded to ask about the night in Long Beach. She said hey, I have no hard feelings over what happended to which I didn't respond and then she said "what happened that night?" "All i really remember was Katie throwing a chair at me" I said " I don't want to talk about it Kristen" and we walked off. My friend Kim thought I was being very rude. She asked me why I was so rude to someone that appeared to be so nice. So I had to tell the whole story over dinner. I was once again completely shocked. All I could do was laugh.
