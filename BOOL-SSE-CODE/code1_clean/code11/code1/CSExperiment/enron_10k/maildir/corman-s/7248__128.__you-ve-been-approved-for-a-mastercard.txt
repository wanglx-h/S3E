Your life can be what you want it to be - Take it one day at a time. Count your blessings, not your troubles, And you'll make it through what comes along. Within you are so many answers, Understand, have courage, be strong. Don't put limits on yourself, Your dreams are waiting to be realized. Don't leave your important decisions to chance - Reach for your peak, your goal, and your prize. [IMAGE][IMAGE][IMAGE] Nothing wastes more energy than worrying - The longer a problem is carried, the heavier it gets. Don't take things too seriously - Live a life of serenity, not a life of regrets. Remember that a little love goes a long way - Remember that a lot goes forever. Remember that friendship is a wise investment, Life's treasures are people... together. Have health and hope and happiness, Take the time to wish on a star. And don't ever forget for even a day... How very special YOU are!
