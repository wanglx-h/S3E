Subject: NY City Information
Scott, I overheard you talking about NY City studies earlier. The two files attached were work in progress that I although not completed and a little rough I thought may be useful in their current form. I am working with Sabina Rank to take over and complete all of my projects and daily fundamentals duties. Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks, Sean If you have problems with the links when opening this file, I also put a copy in O//_Dropbox
