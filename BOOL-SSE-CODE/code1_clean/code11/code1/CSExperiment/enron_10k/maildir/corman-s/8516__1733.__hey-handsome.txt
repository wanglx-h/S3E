Hi Mark ? How are you? ? I wanted to call you at home, but I am never really sure when you are sleeping and I don't want to call and wake you up. I know that you are busy at work but maybe you can call me when you have a free moment...in between the stress. ? I was wondering if you had any plans this week on your "Friday" night? Which I think is Thursday or Wednesday...I'm not really sure because it seems like you have worked a lot already this week. ? Anyway, I'll get to the point. Would you like to come over on Thursday and have dinner with me? I'll make something good. Val will be at Jerry's so it would just be you and me. ? Call me and let me know. ? Amy 503-644-5319 work ? ?
