Subject: RE: Invoice - Heath Scissor - Corporate Housing
I think this is a pre-petition expense. I'm not sure if we can pay. Arguably it falls into the $15000 business expenses limit inclusive of the $4500, i.e. net $10500. Bottom-line, Michelle needs to make a ruling. -----Original Message----- From: Pierce, Shelly Sent: Friday, December 07, 2001 4:10 PM To: Oxley, David Cc: Walton, Sheila Subject: Invoice - Heath Schiesser - Corporate Housing David: Below is a summary of the outstanding invoices for Heath Schiesser's Corporate Housing as received via fax today from HomeCorp Relocation Inc.: Invoice #7704 Invoice Date: November 30, 2001 Rent Billing from 11/11/01 - 11/30/01 $1,383.33 Rent Billing from 12/01/01 - 12/10/01 $ 691.67 Total $2,075.00 Invoice #7705 Invoice Date: Nonmember 30, 2001 Rent Billing from 12/11/01 - 12/31/01 $1,452.50 Rent Billing from 01/01/02 - 01/09/02 $ 622.50 Total $2,075.00 TOTAL CURRENTLY DUE $4,150.00 If you agree to approve, please indicate approval via e-mail.
