I utilized a variety of legal memorandums and topic reference in developing this. In the many instances listed, the consensus from both NEPCO and ECC should be paramount. Please let me know if there are topics you would clarify. I believe we were going to attempt a joint discussion after receipt and review of this draft. I have good availability for a conference discussion on: Thursday 6/1/2000 - through 6 PM PST Monday 6/5/2000 - 12 through 6 PM PST Thursday 6/8/2000 - 12 through 5 PM PST I will be trying to vacation in the interim periods. Thanks, I'll look forward to your comments. Rj.
