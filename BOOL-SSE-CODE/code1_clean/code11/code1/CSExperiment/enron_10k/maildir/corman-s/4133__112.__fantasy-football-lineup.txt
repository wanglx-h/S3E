Subject: Fantasy football lineup
My add drops haven't been approved, so here's my official lineup: ? QB???? Beurlein RB???? Wheatley RB???? Smith WR??? Robinson WR??? Morton WR??? Ward K?????? Detroit D?????? New Orleans? ? I can't log on to the CBS Sportsline server, and I'm on my way out to play golf, so if any of the above wide receivers are on bye, Gonzalez is the starter instead of them (but I think all those receivers are playing). ? Bench: QB??? Plummer??? bye RB??? James??????? bye RB??? Chauncey WR??? Gonzalez WR??? Sanders??? bye WR??? Mathis??????? may be injured ?
