Subject: EPSA Draft Comments on Staff Proposed Market Monitoring and
	Mitigation Report
MEMORANDUM TO: Regulatory Affairs Committee Power Marketers Working Group FROM: Joe Hartsoe, Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair Bob Reilley, Power Marketing Working Group Chair Julie Simon, Vice President of Policy DATE: March 19, 2001 RE: EPSA Draft Comments on Staff's Proposed Market Monitoring and Mitigation Report ? Filing Due March 22nd ? Conference Call on Wednesday, March 21st, 2:00 p.m. (EST) Attached are draft EPSA comments in response to the Commission Staff's recommendations on market monitoring and mitigation in California. As explained in an earlier memo, these proposals are designed to replace to $150 price break set out in the Commission's December 15th order, which is scheduled to run only until April 30th. While supporting certain aspects of the Staff's recommendations, including the extremely limited application and the use of a single price auction, EPSA's comments focus on the failure of the Commission's cost-based approach to capture the full costs of capacity, scarcity, opportunity cost, risk and operating costs and the problem of using a cost-based approach during periods of scarcity. Comments for rehearing are due at FERC on Thursday, March 22nd. We will discuss this draft on our regular Wednesday afternoon conference call on March 21st at 2:00 p.m. (EST). To access the call, dial 1-800-937-6563. Ask for the Julie Simon/EPSA Call. If you have any questions or concerns, or any comments on the draft, please contact Julie at 202-628-8200 or jsimon@epsa.org. Attachment - CA Mkt. Monitoring Recommendation Filing.doc
