I have received authorization to get the ball rolling. Greg is anxious to start selling yesterday and has idle resources that he would like to deploy. Can you please develop a TC for the product described in the attached Product Approval Template? Additionally, based on Jim's request to move up rollout to before Labor Day, I have also attached a revised timeline. Thanks.
