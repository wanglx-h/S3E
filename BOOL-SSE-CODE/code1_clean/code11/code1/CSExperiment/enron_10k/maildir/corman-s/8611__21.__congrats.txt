Subject: Congrats!
CONGRATULATIONS ON THE CLOSURE OF THE ALAMAC/AIG TRANSACTION!! Fantastic effort and job well done from beginning to end! I don't remember the other folks involved on your deal team but I do know this deal would not have happened had it not been for you three! I remember when we started this last July (remember the $1 DASH ?!), the hurdles that kept popping up (oh, just a little bankruptcy proceeding), and the s-l-i-c-k structuring of the entire transaction. Bought if for $3.5 million, sold it for $26 million, marked an incremental $5 million on a coal contract, and still have the right to "broker" another sale and keep 90% of the proceeds ( another $10+ million)!! Pretty awesome. This was really a great job by all! Let me know the date of the celebration dinner!
