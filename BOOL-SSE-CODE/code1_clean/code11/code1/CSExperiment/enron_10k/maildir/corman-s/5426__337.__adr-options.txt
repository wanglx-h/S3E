Subject: ADR Options
<<ADR Options Master.rtf>> Hi Sarah, Here is the compilation of ADR-related "options.". I haven't yet received anything from Mary or Don, so these sections are not included in this version. I started to incorporate the various pieces of this into the ADR provision itself, but it quickly became clear that was not going to be a productive task until we narrow the options. I will not be in Portland next week, but will dial in if that option is available. Thanks, Paul > Paul B.
