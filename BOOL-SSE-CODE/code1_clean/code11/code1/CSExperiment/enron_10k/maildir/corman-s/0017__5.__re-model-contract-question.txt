Subject: RE: Model Contract Question
Each Data Protection Supervisory Authority can be contacted; some may review. We are not aware of one supervisory authority that can bind all authorities in all states with its approval of a contract. But if you are not required by law to pre-submit your contract, I question whether you want to do so. You may get multiple interpretations. We believe that you should develop your best judgment about whether your documents conform to the legal requirements and submit the contract where you are required to do so, not seek advice from the regulatory authorities about the specifics of your contracts. After all, as we indicated this area of the law is still in flux, and we would hate to see you lock into a position with an authority--unless you absolutely had to do so.
