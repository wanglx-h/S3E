Subject: RE: Storage Desk 3rd Party Storage Procedures
Reyna and Michele, What do you think of the idea that We place the NNG and Procedures for Offsystem Transactions in a header to the document with Michele's as Part A - Initiation & Regulatory; Reyna's Part B - Deal making and Mine Part C Nominations & Scheduling. From that the procedures could be subdivide for 3rd Party storage or transportation. Reyna... also in your Part B & C Specific Deal & Fuel....It is Gas Logistics' recommendation that Marketing e-mail the Deal/Purchase sheet to Chris and Debbie with copies going to Lynn and Myself. That way in Chris' absence, someone can follow up on the nom/scheduling. -----Original Message----- From: Cabrera, Reyna Sent: Thursday, November 15, 2001 5:36 PM To: Blair, Lynn; Bodnar, Michael; Winckowski, Michele; Fancler, Dan; Buchanan, John; Williams, Jo Subject: Storage Desk 3rd Party Storage Procedures Attached are the Storage Desk 3rd Party Storage Procedures for your information. << File: 3rd Party Storage Procedures.doc >> Reyna Cabrera (713) 853-3072
