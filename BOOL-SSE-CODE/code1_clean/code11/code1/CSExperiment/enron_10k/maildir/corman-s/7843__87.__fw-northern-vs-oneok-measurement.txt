The purpose of the meeting is to discuss the logistics involved in the removal of the rich stream inlet meter and any additional meters as determined prior to this date. The discussion will be focused on the operational and physical requirements of removing the meter/meters for test and not on why the test is being conducted. The meeting will take place in the basement of the OneOK office at Bushton. Please let me know if conflicts occur with this date. Mike
