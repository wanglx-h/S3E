Subject: Gov. Davis is expected to deliver a five-minute speech to
 Californians Thursday night
FYI on behalf of Sue Mara: Governor Gray Davis to address California energy crisis It is expected he will be speaking for about four minutes and that he will start at about 6:05 p.m. PDT. Gov. Davis is expected to deliver a five-minute speech to Californians Thursday night ? From CNN.com: April 5, 2001 Web posted at: 4:38 p.m. EDT (2038 GMT) Hena Cuevas is a CNN Correspondent based out of California. Q: What do we expect to be the main points of Governor Gray Davis' address this evening? CUEVAS: His office has said that the basic theme will be conservation. Basically, he is trying to motivate everyone to conserve. Also, we are expected to hear a stern warning involving the power situation this summer. It is expected to be a warmer than average summer. Davis e is also going to address that. We have also been told that he will make some sort of announcement and that the announcement is being kept under tight wraps; it is top secret. At this point we can,t even speculate as to what it will be. But there will be a big announcement. It is expected he will be speaking for about four minutes and that he will start at about 6:05 p.m. PDT. Q: How has the energy crisis affected the Governor's popularity? CUEVAS: The latest polls -- and these were probably around Mid-March ) show that his popularity and his approval ratings have declined. The latest poll commissioned by the Service Employees International Union shows that only 29 percent of those surveyed said that they would vote for Davis again. He, however, is trying to distance himself from this energy problem saying that it is the responsibility of the Republican lead Senate and Legislature who were the ones that passed these deregulation laws and that basically, he just got handed the problem and he is trying to solve it. There was the first ever state Democratic convention in Orange County last weekend ) Orange County has traditionally been highly Republican. Everybody there said that they supported Governor Davis and that they believe that the Democratic Party in this state will not be affected by this crisis, that they are basically trying to fix what the previous administration did. Q: What impact will the California energy crisis have on Davis, political future? CUEVAS: Davis says that it will not impact his future. He feels very confident that he has been able to send out the message that he is not responsible for this crisis and that he is doing everything in his power to fix it. One of the things that he mentioned in a press conference on Saturday is that there are already new electrical plants that are under construction that should be ready by either 2004 or 2005. He says that he is doing everything in his power to be able to solve this crisis. Again, as things worsen and as the rolling blackouts begin and continue over the summer, obviously, everybody is trying to find somebody to blame and he is in the perfect position. That is why a lot of fingers are being pointed toward him. Q: What actions has the Governor taken so far to try to avert the energy crisis? CUEVAS: One of the things that he has approved is the construction of new energy plants. Also, he is asking that private companies and other large power users be allowed to contract directly for power with generators. This is different than what the Public Utilities Commission had been arguing for. He has also put forth called the 20/20 plan that says that if you save 20 percent on your consumption of energy as compared to last summer, you will get 20 percent off your energy bill for the four summer months. He is doing everything in his power, he says, to try and avoid an even higher rate increase. However, there are a lot of people who are arguing for a higher rate and saying that would be the only way to try and stop this crisis. Q: Do you have any final thoughts to share? CUEVAS: When you go down to the consumers themselves, everyone is trying to make sure that the average resident is not the one footing the bill for the problems that are taking place at the governmental level. There seems to be a lot of frustration from both residents and businesses. There was a symposium at UCLA yesterday where the Anderson Business Forecast, a group that usually does economic forecast for the state of California, said their concern was that California would be affected in the long run. They said that those that are thinking about doing business in California might be hesitant and might look at other states that do not have this uncertainty with the energy situation and therefore, may not establish operations in California. That was one of the biggest concerns. Right now California ranks number 48 or 49 in energy consumption so it is very energy efficient and aware as far as conservation efforts. So, hopefully, by conserving they might be able to get past this summer and have a solution by the end of the year.
