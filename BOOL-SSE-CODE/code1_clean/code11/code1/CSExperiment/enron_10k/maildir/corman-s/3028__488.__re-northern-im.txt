We should change all refernces to say top 10 customers provide 66 percent of revenues . I changed that in one prior draft. The other figure is the top 15 contracts. I think we should stick to customer figures rather than mix customer and contract stats -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net)
