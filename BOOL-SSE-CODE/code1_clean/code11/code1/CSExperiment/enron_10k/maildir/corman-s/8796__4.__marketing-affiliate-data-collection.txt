CONFIDENTIAL AND PRIVILEDGED ATTORNEY CLIENT WORK PRODUCT Yesterday, we had a conference call with the pipeline transportation analysts to determine whether John Morris, the economist who will conduct a market power study for INGAA, had crafted a data request that would gather the right sort of information nececessary.? Columbia, Enron, and Koch did not have representatives on the call.? I'm available this afternoon to give you all an update on what was discussed?? We decided to take a snap shot in time on firm pipeline transactions that occurred during the month of November 2000.? John Morris will be sending out a revised data request (through me) that reflects some of the suggestions proposed by the group.? He is very open to tallking to your transportation folks directly to answer any questions you may have.? You have his telephone number from an earlier email.???
