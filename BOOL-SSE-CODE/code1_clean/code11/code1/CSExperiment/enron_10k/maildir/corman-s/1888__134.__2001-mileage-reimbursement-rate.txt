Subject: 2001 Mileage Reimbursement Rate
The IRS has announced that the standard mileage rate for use of a personal automobile for business will be 34 1/2 cents per mile starting January 1, 2001. Enron's policy is to follow IRS guidelines, so use this rate for all mileage incurred on or after that date.
