I spoke with Denise briefly and I believe she was looking into the EEI issue with Ed Sacks. I would contact Denise directly on this one as I believe Dana has not been involved to date. -----Original Message----- From: Ring, Richard Sent: Wednesday, August 22, 2001 4:12 PM To: Copeland, James L. Subject: A'Lones Group / Mirant Energy Americas, L.P James, Thanks for your help with A'Lones Group and Mirant Energy Americas, LP. I have not heard anything from Denise Furey or Dana Smith regarding our conversation from Monday August 20th. Do you have any additional information or should I contact Dana Smith? Regards, Richard
