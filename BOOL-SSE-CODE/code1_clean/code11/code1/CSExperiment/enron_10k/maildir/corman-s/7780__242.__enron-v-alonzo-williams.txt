Subject: Enron v. Alonzo Williams
Hi Michelle, I received in today's mail a notice from the 127th District Court that the Alonzo Williams case will be dismissed for want of prosecution unless we file a sworn motion to retain, or motion for default judgment, before November 2. We talked much earlier in the year about this, and I realize that people have much larger priorities, but I never heard what the business client wanted to do on this one. Can we have a conference call or meeting to resolve this before the end of the month? Let me know your preference. Best regards, Bill Ogden 713-844-3001
