Subject: POCCC Association Minutes
Dear POCCC Members: Attached are the minutes from the August and September meetings of the POCCC Condo Association. I'll try to get these out to everyone on a more timely basis in the future (or get Becky to do them!). Almost everything discussed in the minutes has moved forward substantially since the meetings, so if you have any specific concerns or questions, you had better call somebody. There is no set schedule for Association meetings, but we'll have agendas sent out by e-mail at least a couple of days before the meeting date. We will very likely have a meeting in October. Several people have been asked by their insurance companies to provide the compliance certificate to get windstorm coverage (Form WPI - 8). I have it and can fax it to you if you need it. Let me know. This last weekend was great. Main Lodge is nearly done. Great countertops! Big screen football on Saturday with Franklin and Aplin and everyone they ever met. Mass barbeque Saturday night. Kim and Glen Wind (with a handfull of volunteers) assembled the Kid's Lodge furniture and painted the walls. The room looks great and is ready for action. We're working on the pool fence. Original proposal for blinds is apparently coming to fruition, in about 2 weeks. Closing packages are out. Final cash calls are also out and need to be paid. Working on final punchlist for entire project (not inside your unit). Working on interviewing caretakers and preparing job description. Trash is getting picked up and grass is being mowed.
