Hi Mark, I think I'm finally convinced that it's probably best to have an alcoholic as President following Clinton's sexual escapades!!? This way in four years we can try to find a recovering drug addict to keep the faith.? Then, we can just turn the White House into a whore house because a Mexican Pimp could then be our next choice? -? what do ya think?!? Don't forget to vote for Gore to offset my Bush vote!! Love ya - mean it!!!?? UNCLE BOB Do You Yahoo!? Yahoo! Shopping - Thousands of Stores. Millions of Products. All with one Wallet.
