Subject: contract amendments; bonus memo
Kriste, I believe that all but one of the amendments/bonus memo documents are complete. The only one in question is for Brian Redmond, whose contract we did not have. Jeanie is going to pull the contract in the morning and give it to Twanda. Twanda will prepare the draft amendment and change to the memo and get it to Kriste for finalizing. Then (I hope) we'll be done!!!! Thanks. Michelle PS, the number to the grammar hotline is 713-221-8670.
