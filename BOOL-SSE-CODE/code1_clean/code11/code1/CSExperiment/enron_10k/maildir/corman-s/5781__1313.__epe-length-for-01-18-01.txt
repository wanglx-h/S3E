Subject: EPE length for 01/18/01
Guys, Just a reminder, tonight (01/18/01)we have length in the EPE system at PV, 9 mws for HE 23 and 4 mws for HE 24. This mw total may be revised depending on ST-SW, but you will likely need to sell this energy. Be on the look out for more emails(they would say 'final' amount if I need to change anything). Please send me an email with the prices and the schedule. Thanks. Bill
