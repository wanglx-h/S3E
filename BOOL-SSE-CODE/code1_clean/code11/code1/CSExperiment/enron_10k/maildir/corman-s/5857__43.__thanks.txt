Subject: Thanks!
Received your thank-you letter and appreciate it, especially with the picture. My prayers are with you and your family. Just wanted you to know what a great job Alma Carrillo did in planning your shower, ordering the cake and punch, and collecting money for the gift. I think she deserves a very special thank-you. See you tomorrow at the staff meeting. Alma G.
