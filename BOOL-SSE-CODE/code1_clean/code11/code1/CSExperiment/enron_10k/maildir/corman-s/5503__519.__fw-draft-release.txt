Subject: FW: draft release
Attached is the most recent press release, as of last night. We held off circulating because we anticipated an updated draft but have not yet received one so wanted you to have an opportunity to review what we have. Please let me or Mark Palmer know if you have any comments. Thank you. Karen x39757
