Subject: Spring Break
I was talking to Anita this morning and she was asking me if I knew what games we were going to at spring training - she heard an ad or something for it and it made it sound fun. I think they are trying to decide what to do for Spring Break. They me be planning a Florida Trip. What should I be telling her???? So far I have been very vague about it, but at some point I'm going to have to be more specific. I don't want to hurt her feelings, but I'd rather not spend the whole trip with them. Cindy S.
