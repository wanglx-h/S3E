Subject: TW Customer Interface Group Access/Blackberry Update
Audrey and Steve -- From your Start menu select Programs, Business Applications, TW -- you should have several apps under that. You must select each app and wait for the install. Should only take a few minutes and will only happen the first time or after application updates. Give me a call if you have any questions. Thanks. Jean cell 713-859-6238 I am out of office on vacation today... but feel free to give me a call if you have questions. Blackberry Update: Since we are having problems getting the actual hardware for the Blackberry devices, Corp is providing us with one. I asked Karon to give the Corp team the info required and they are working on changing the "owner" info. Hopefully, you should have it today or tomorrow. I have already sent Karon a follow-up email to check the status.
