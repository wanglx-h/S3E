Subject: RE: Nutcraker Invites
Fantastic. Is Sheila planning to attend? If so then, there are already 8 tickets committed. If any of these cancel, I have a back-up list. I will take 2 seats. Please give me the invites for those two. I'll take care of their transport. They will not need Enron transport. -----Original Message----- From: Garcia, Ava Sent: Tuesday, October 23, 2001 8:40 AM To: Corman, Shelley Subject: Nutcraker Invites The following are names that Lynn wanted invited to the Nutcraker: Dawnell Pace NorthWest Pipeline Janette Aggeguin PNM Gas Services Julia Clevenger US Gas Transportation Pat Davidson Southern CA GAs Corp.
