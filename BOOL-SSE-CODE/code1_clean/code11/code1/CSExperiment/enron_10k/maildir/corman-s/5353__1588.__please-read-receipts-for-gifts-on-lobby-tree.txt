Subject: PLEASE READ: Receipts for Gifts on Lobby Tree...
It is important that you bring me a copy of your receipt for the gifts that you purchase for the tree in the lobby area. We will tally all of the receipts and request matching fund from Enron. Those funds will go directly to the Salvation Army. I am locking the gifts in a file cabinet for safe keeping, so please bring them to me. Thanks for your support. Teri
