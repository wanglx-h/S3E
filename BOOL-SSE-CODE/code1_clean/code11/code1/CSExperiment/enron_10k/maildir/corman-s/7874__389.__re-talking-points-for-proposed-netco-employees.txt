Subject: Re: Talking Points for Proposed NETCO Employees
Have we assigned employees to netco? I didn't think we had. In fact I think we were going to move everyone into ena and have them hired by netco after closing. I am on blackberry and missed the end of the talking points. Could you resend? Thanks. Michelle -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net)
