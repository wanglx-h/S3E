Subject: CAISO Notice - Congestion Reform Project
Market Participants: At the June 8 Congestion Reform Stakeholder meeting, we discussed the possibility of a meeting on June 20 to address locational market power mitigation. We will not hold such a meeting on June 20th. However, we are working on a comprehensive project schedule and plan to have it to you by the end of this week. That schedule should cover meetings on Congestion Management for June, July, August and early September. Byron Woertz Director, Client Relations
