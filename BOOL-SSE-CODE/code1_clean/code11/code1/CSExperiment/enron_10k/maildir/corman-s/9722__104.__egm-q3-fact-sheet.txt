Subject: EGM Q3 fact sheet
All, Attached, for your information, is a 2 page financial and statistical fact sheet for EGM (as a consolidated unit and for each business unit). I obviously would have liked our gross margin and EBIT to be a lot larger but all the other facts show enormous growth and progress. I wanted to at least get it into your hands in case you needed a quick reference. Thanks, Mike
