Subject: FW: PJM (PECO ENERGY COMPANY)
Guys This is the list of customers sent by Richard Ring. Let's cross check his list with a list that you guys can generate by querying the following utilities: Public Service Electric & Gas Co. PECO Energy Company PPL Electric Utilities Baltimore Gas & Electric Co. Pennsylvania Electric Co. (GPU) Metropolitan Edison Co. (GPU) Jersey Central Power & Light Co. (GPU) Potomac Electric Power Co. Delmarva Power & Light Co. (Conectiv) Altlantic Electric Co. (Conectiv) This may be overkill since Richard has identified only physical customers behind PECO. Thx Berney -----Original Message----- From: Ring, Richard Sent: Monday, December 10, 2001 4:17 PM To: Aucoin, Berney C. ; Furrow, Dale Subject: PJM (PECO ENERGY COMPANY) Berney & Dale, The attached spreadsheet indicates the fifteen (15) accounts in the PJM Control Area that EESI currently delivers physical power to. The fifteen (15) accounts are all behind PECO Energy Company. Most of the contracts were "commodity only" deals that have expired, with the exception of American College which expires 01/31/2002. The other accounts are behind bundled outsource deals (i) Simon Properties (Cheltenham Shopping & SDG Macerich Properties) and (ii) Suiza Foods (Lehigh Valley Dairies) and (iii) Prudential Insurance Companies. Let me know if I can be of further assistance. Richard
