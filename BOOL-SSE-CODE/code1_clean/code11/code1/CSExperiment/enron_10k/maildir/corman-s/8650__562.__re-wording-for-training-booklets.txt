Subject: RE: Wording for Training Booklets
I'd like a copy of that, if possible. I think it should state: Confidential and Proprietary -- Not to be Disclosed to Persons Other Than Human Resources and Legal Department. If possible, put it on all documents, as well as the cover of the notebook.

I assume we need to mark these documents as confidential and proprietary. Is there any specific wording you would like on either a introduction page or as a footer on each page? Please let me know ASAP so I can finalize the documents. Thanks - Tana
