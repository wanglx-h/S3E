Subject: RE:
Not a "date" date. Just somebody to go with me. It could have been a girl for all I cared. But I'm glad I didn't bring anybody. The party was lame. I didn't invite Dave just to spite him because I'm immature like that :) When we started seeing eachother again, the whole seeing other people was left up in the air. But it was made clear that neither of us would like it if we found out the other person was dating someone else. And we could not sleep with anybody else by any means! But it's become more strict and very evident that neither of us even want to see anybody else. I just have my guard up right now. So even though we are basically back together, I don't want to make it official. I'm still letting him stir. -----Original Message----- From: Mark.Guzman@enron.com [mailto:Mark.Guzman@enron.com] Sent: Monday, November 06, 2000 10:51 AM To: Katie.Trullinger@wfsg.com Subject: RE: How come you wanted a date for halloween then?
