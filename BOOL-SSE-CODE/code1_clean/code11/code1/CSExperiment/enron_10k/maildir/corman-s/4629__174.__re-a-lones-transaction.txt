Scott, Any response from Denise? -----Original Message----- From: Franck, Scott Sent: Tuesday, October 09, 2001 1:41 PM To: dfurey@enron.com Cc: rring@enron.com Subject: A'lones transaction Denise: Richard Ring suggested that you were the appropriate person to contact regarding filling in some blanks on the Master Power Purchase & Sale Agreement between EES and A'lones. I have attached hereto a copy of the Agreement. The Cover Sheet (see p. 2-3 of the attachment) has a series of elections and blanks for amounts, guarantor credit ratings, etc. I would appreciate your assistance in getting these items completed. If you have questions regarding A'lones, background of the transaction, and party expectations, please give Richard Ring a call. Thanks for your help. Scott L.
