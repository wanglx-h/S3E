Amy, we do put people under contract with a definite term; however, at the end of that term, the employee converts to an employee at will. We also hire consultants for a fixed term, but a year-long period for an individual is pretty long for a consultng position. What is the situation? Maybe we can find an alternative.

I got a question today from RD Hawkins as LasVegas Cogen asking if we could hire someone for a one year period of time. I know we can do it in the UK, just not sure about the US. Thanks! Amy
