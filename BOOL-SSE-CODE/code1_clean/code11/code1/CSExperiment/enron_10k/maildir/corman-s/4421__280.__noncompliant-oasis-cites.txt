Subject: Noncompliant OASIS cites
Tim said you were having a problem using our harvester to get companys/entities' ATC that aren't complying with FERC's OASIS requirements. Tim suggested that I help you resolve this. Could you make me a list of companies/entities that aren't complying? Then we could discuss how to address the problem with each company/entity. Tim suggested that, to the extent we want companies to comply, we could call them and ask them to comply. If they don't I suggested we could call the FERC hotline on a confidential basis.
