Subject: Missing pages of NWEC Rebuttal
Attached are pages 3 and 4 of NW Energy Coalition/Save Our Wild Salmon (WP-02-E-NA/SA-04) Rebuttal testimony which was missing from some copies. If you would like a hard copy, I can fax it or mail it to you--just say the word. Sorry about this! Steve Weiss 503 393-8859 - NWECrebuttalP3and4.doc
