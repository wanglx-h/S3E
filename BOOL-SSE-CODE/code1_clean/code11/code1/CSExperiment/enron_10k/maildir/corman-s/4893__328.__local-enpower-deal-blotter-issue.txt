Subject: Local Enpower Deal Blotter Issue
Attention Enpower Users, We are currently experiencing server connectivity issues with Deal Blotter's blotter server when using your local version of Enpower. Until this problem is resolved, Deal Blotter will only be accessible through Terminal Server. I will send a follow-up email as soon as this issue is resolved or when an ETA has been determined. Thanks, David Poston
