Shelley: Do you have any information on Project Max that we could use in the business plan for NNG? -----Original Message----- From: Hayslett, Rod Sent: Tuesday, February 19, 2002 7:02 AM To: Howard, Kevin A.

I want to include a page on market strategy - is project MAX a real expansion and if so, who has data on it? The NNG bus plan is in very good shape thanks to the work jayshree and davis did on the info memo! I will have first draft by wed. -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net)
