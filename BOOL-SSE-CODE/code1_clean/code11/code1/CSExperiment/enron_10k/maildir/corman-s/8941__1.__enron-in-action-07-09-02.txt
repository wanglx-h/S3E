Peru is beginning reconstruction after a powerful earthquake devastated the southern region of the Andean highlands last Saturday. The 8.1-magnitude earthquake, that has been recently upgraded to the "great" quake category - the most powerful according to the U.S. Geological Survey- triggered a tsunami that crashed into the seaport town of Camana destroying more houses and raising the death toll. Up to now, the earthquake has left over 100 people dead, 1,374 injured and 47,696 homeless. The people who lost their homes have been forced to sleep on the ground in Peru's frigid Andes highlands, tents provided by the army and by some help organizations does not provide sufficient insulation against winter temperatures in that region. Help is urgently needed. If you would like to contribute to this cause please send your donations to: American Red Cross 2700 Southwest Freeway Houston TX 77098 (In the memo line of your check please write: Earthquake-Peru) In order to get Enron to match your donations dollar for dollar please go to http://home.enron.com/cr/ and click on Gifts, Grants and Giving.
