Hey Tyson. Are you guys doing anything after the game? I think Ben Pacewic, Jeff Burns, Kevin Stangeland, Chris Hartman, Rueben Schug and some other guys are coming down and staying the night but i don't think we will have time to stop by before the game. I know I would like to come by the house and see how things are doing and I am sure those guys would to so let me know if you guys have anything going on Saturday night. YITB GUZ
