Subject: Tranny Contracts
FYI, I am starting to collect all the executed tranny contracts along with current transmission tariffs (i.e., OATTs) in: p:\regulatory affairs\alan Comnes\transmission agreements and tariffs. If there is already a place locally where we have such contracts collected, please let me know. GAC
