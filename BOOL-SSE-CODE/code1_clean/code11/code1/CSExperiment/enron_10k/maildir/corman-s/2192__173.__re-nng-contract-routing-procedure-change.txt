Subject: RE: NNG Contract Routing Procedure Change
Danny should no longer receive any Northern contracts to review or sign off on- We will need to replace with Dan Dienstbier, who fornuately the policy incorporates. I do believe that there had been a change on the Demarc/Bushton policy- need to find and incorporate- MK -----Original Message----- From: Dietz, Rick Sent: Wednesday, February 06, 2002 2:16 PM To: Miller, Mary Kay; Porter, J. Gregory; Neubauer, Dave Cc: McCarty, Danny; Corman, Shelley; Trevino, Linda; Winckowski, Michele Subject: NNG Contract Routing Procedure Change Michelle, Linda and I were discussing whether we should remove Danny McCarty from the Northern routing contract approval process. Since he is an employee of Enron, he is potentially a marketing affiliate. We believe that we should either set up Dan Dienstbier (if he prefers to be involved in the contract approval process) or stop it at the VP level. What are your thoughts? A copy of our current policy is attached for your reference. Rick << File: RoutePolicy.xls >> << File: RoutePolicy.xls >>
