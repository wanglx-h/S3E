Subject: FW: Confidentiality Questions for Legal

Many thanks, Karen. -----Original Message----- From: Linhart, Gary Sent: Wednesday, November 14, 2001 3:40 PM To: Buckley, Karen Subject: Confidentiality Questions for Legal Karen, Thanks for taking the time to discuss the confidentiality agreement pertaining to the ENA Trading Track. As discussed, I am following up with a couple of questions regarding the contents of the agreement, specifically item 1.2. From what I gather, the agreement very broadly covers the financial industry and I wanted to list a few scenarios to see if they are included or not included by the agreement. - Non energy, non commodity based private equity firms - Non energy-sector coverage within a mutual fund company - Non derivatives based hedge fund - Non energy based investment banking - Equity research in with non-energy or commodity industry coverage Please let me know for each of the above what is included and excluded. Regards, Gary Linhart -----Original Message----- From: Buckley, Karen Sent: Wednesday, November 14, 2001 9:54 AM Subject: Trading Track Pls call and advise when it is convenient for you to drop by my desk today.
