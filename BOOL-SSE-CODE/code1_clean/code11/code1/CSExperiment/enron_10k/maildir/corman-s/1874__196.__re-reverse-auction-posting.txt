Subject: RE: Reverse Auction Posting
I spoke with Steve Kirk regarding this issue. On May 3, 2001, the Reverse Auction shippers were notified that the Reverse Auction Pool POI would be terminated November 1 and a revised Appendix A for the contracts setting forth the specific allocations of entitlement at Ventura, Welcome and Aberdeen points were provided to the shippers. Therefore, the notice on the website would only need to remind shippers that the Reverse Auction Pool will terminate effective November 1, 2001. We would recommend that the following notice be posted at anytime. Reminder: The Reverse Auction Pool POI 60460 will be terminated November 1, 2001. Please let me know if there are any questions or concerns. Thanks MW -----Original Message----- From: Buchanan, John Sent: Wednesday, October 17, 2001 9:19 AM To: Blair, Lynn; Winckowski, Michele; Fowler, Bill; Paladino, Ranelle Subject: Reverse Auction Posting Below is some suggested language for the Reverse Auction posting.
