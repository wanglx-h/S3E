Privileged & Confidential David, As far as I can tell, Mike McCall is not under a current employment agreement. I sent you a draft agreement for him on December 2, 1999, and have heard nothing more about the status of that agreement. I do not have any other information about the terms of his employment (salary, options, etc.). Let me know if you would like any other information from me.
