AZPS is infamous for changing their requirements on tags. So is SRP. Just do what you need to do to get your tags implemented. Until the standards are published, the Control Areas are god. To: Cara Semperger/PDX/ECT@ECT cc: Jesse Bryson/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Becky at APS turned down a tag for me last night for HE 4MST that we have been using for several weeks without a problem. The tag number is 18594. Tis was a sale from EPE to PNM at 4C. She turned it down saying that EPE is not a control area at 4C and that PNM should be in the CA for the first line. I argued with her about it for quite a while but she insisted that it was wrong. Could you please take a look at this and tell me if she is wrong. Thank you.
