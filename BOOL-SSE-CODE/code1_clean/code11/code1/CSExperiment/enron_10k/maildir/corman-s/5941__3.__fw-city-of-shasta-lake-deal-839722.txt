-----Original Message----- From: Murphy, Melissa Ann Sent: Friday, October 26, 2001 9:37 AM To: Rosman, Stewart Cc: Cason, Sharen Subject: City of Shasta Lake-Deal # 839722 Stewart, I highlighted the special conditions section. I know the special conditions section currently in the confirm is not correct but I am not sure what it needs to be changed to. I also highlighted the contract name because I don't think a transmission deal can be done under the EEI agreement. Thanks, Melissa Please copy Sharen on any e-mail response. If I am not available she will be finishing this confirm.
