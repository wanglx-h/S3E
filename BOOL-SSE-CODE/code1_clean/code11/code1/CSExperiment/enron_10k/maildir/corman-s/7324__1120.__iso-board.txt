Subject: ISO Board
Here is my idea for challenging the new ISO Board. According to the trade press, one of the ISO Board's first actions will be to file with FERC to request more time to act on the FERC's requirement to file a market redesign. We (or WPTF) would file a protest asking the FERC to reject the filing because the ISO does not have the authority to act.
