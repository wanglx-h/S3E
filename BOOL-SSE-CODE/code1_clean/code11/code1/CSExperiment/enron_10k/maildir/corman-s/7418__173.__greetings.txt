Subject: Greetings
Hi, Sorry I didn't get back to you yesterday. Chad had soccer practice last night & I have something I must do tonight. I'm taking the day off tomorrow. Would there be a good time to visit tomorrow? When is Tom home from school - so he and Chad could play. Or, if you'd rather, I'd be happy to sit with Kathleen or the kids anytime this weekend. Two other items when you get a chance: -Are you still selling Nutcraker tickets? I can't recall the date. -Are you still interested in me selling Shopping Cards at Enron. I need to reserve dates/table space in lobby. Hope all is well. Talk to you soon. Shelley
