Subject: RE: Subsidiary Equity or Phantom Equity
Aaron, does this apply to companies in which we have a large ownership interest, but that may not be a "subsidiary"? Thanks.

Mary and I can and will work closely and quickly with any group needing to get this done. Mary is responsible for presenting the plan for approval to the Compensation Committee after Tax, Legal, Accounting, Commercial and HR interests are scrubbed. These types of plans have accounting, legal and tax complexities that need to be worked out and change regularly. Also, it is very important that no written or verbal promise related to equity grants before Compensation Committee approval is obtained. Regards, Aaron x39280
