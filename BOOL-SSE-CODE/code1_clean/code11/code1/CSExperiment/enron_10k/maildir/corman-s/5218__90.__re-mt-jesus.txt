Subject: RE: MT. Jesus
I have a conference call with Delaine at 3:15 today on Strangers Gas. She is to give me Mike Belcher's phone number. He is the person coordinating all the condensate issues. If we send a letter I would send it to Terry Spencer and reference Mike Belcher. If you need more, let me know. Thanks.

Please review this letter and give me your observations, suggestions. << File: Mt Jesus2.doc >> Lynn, Any better name than Spencer to send this to? Dan/Mark Can you get me updated numbers?
