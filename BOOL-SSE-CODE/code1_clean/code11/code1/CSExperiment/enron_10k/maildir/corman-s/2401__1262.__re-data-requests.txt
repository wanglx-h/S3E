Yes, this question pertains to generation owned or controlled in California. Since Enron does not own or control any generation in California this data request would not apply. >>> <Mary.Hain@enron.com> 10/06/00 01:32PM >>> Concerning your Data Request to Generators #2, I believe this question was sent to us in error. Enron Power Marketing does not own any generation in California, so these questions do not apply. Please let me know if I have read the question incorrectly.
