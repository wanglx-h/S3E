Subject: Re: You Can Put A Stake in Their Hearts but They Never Die
Dr. Bowring has a PHD in economics and is a bright guy. He is the Market Monitoring Unit in PJM. While he says he generally believes that "shortage" is not necessarily "market power" he sometimes has to be reminded of that principal. Prior to PJM, Joe was with the NJ Public Advocate where he did not endear himself to the regulated utilities. Since leaving the Advocate and working for PJM I think Joe has been somewhat more open to market solutions and is generally cooperative in working with members to achieve market solutions to issues rather than unilaterally initiating rule changes. I find Joe easy to work with and, as previously stated, generally open to discussion in resolving issues and is not necessarily predisposed to a solution.

Rising from the almost dead ... This "Market Repair Committee" is supported by Eric Woychik, advisor to Board Member Florio. The Committee members are Joskow, Hogan, PJM people, et cetera, et cetera. There will be something posted on the ISO's web site shortly. It will be approved at the Board meeting Thursday. I'll be there. Sue Mara Enron Corp. Tel: (415) 782-7802 Fax:(415) 782-7854
