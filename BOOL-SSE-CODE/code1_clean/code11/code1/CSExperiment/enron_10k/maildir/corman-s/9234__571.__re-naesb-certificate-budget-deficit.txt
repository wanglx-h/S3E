Subject: RE: NAESB Certificate - Budget Deficit
Thanks I found this too. -----Original Message----- From: Hess, Theresa Sent: Thursday, March 07, 2002 12:42 PM To: Corman, Shelley Subject: NAESB Certificate - Budget Deficit According to the Certificate changes, which are filed with the state of Delaware, Article VII, Section 1 was deleted in its entirety and replaced. The replacement language is consistent with the latest copy that I gave you earlier today. In this same filing, a change was made to Article V, Section 6. It states that the determination of how to fund a budget deficit will be made via a super majority vote of the Board. The language is: Section 6. A vote of at least seventy-five percent (75%) from the Board, including an affirmative vote of at least forty percent (40%) from the Directors representing each Segment within each Quadrant, shall be required to determine how to fund a budget deficit or to establish or modify a promotional dues program. The filing is dated August 3, 1998.
