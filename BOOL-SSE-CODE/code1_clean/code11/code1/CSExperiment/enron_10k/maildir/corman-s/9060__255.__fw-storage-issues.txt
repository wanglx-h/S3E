Lynn...Do you have a couple of minutes to discuss this note from Tim? -----Original Message----- From: Johanson, Tim Sent: Friday, November 09, 2001 10:34 AM To: Bodnar, Michael; Miller, Kent Subject: FW: Storage issues Importance: High Mike, I spoke with Steve Sweeney at Cogentrix today regarding this spreadsheet, and he would like to see our data for every day from June 1, 2001 through September 30, 2001 as you calculated for the few random days throughout the summer. The spreadsheet seems to indicate that we did not allocate Cogentrix on some of the days in question. This information is contrary to the information Steve provided and must be explored further. Steve is getting impatient with this process. He would like to see this come to a resolution as soon as possible. I said that I understand his concern and we will do our best to resolve this in a timely matter. Kent, once Mike finishes the spreadsheet, I recommend that we meet and discuss our offer to Cogentrix.
