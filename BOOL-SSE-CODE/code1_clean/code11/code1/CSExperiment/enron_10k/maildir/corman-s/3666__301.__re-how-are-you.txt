Subject: RE: How are you?
Thank you for your thoughts. I am fine. Our pipeline companies were not included in the bankruptcy petition and we are continuing operations normally. While these have certainly been stressful times and a sad day for the many Enron employees that lost their jobs today, we have not had any workforce reductions in our area. It's a little lonely in the building and I have to make sure to put my lipstick on before I go down to the lobby to face all the TV cameras camped out down there! -----Original Message----- From: Ellie Francisco [mailto:Ellie.Francisco@Halliburton.com] Sent: Monday, December 03, 2001 4:13 PM To: Corman, Shelley Subject: How are you?
