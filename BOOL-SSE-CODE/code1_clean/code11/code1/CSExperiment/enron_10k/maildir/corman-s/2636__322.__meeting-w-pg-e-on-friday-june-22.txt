Subject: Meeting w/PG&E on Friday, June 22
Greg, I received the list of players on the PG&E side today from Glynn's office. I called Mark Haedicke to give him the rundown, and he feels comfortable with you and Jeff attending the meeting alone. As Jeff will be arriving in Dallas from San Francisco, you will need to get yourself to Dallas; however, we will add your name to the manifest for the return to Houston unless we hear otherwise from you. Below are the details as we know them now: Date: Friday, June 22 Time: 12:30 p.m.-2:30 p.m. Location: 100 Crescent Court, 6th Floor (Wasserstein's offices), Dallas PG&E players: Bob Glynn, Chairman & CEO, PG&E Corp. Gordon Smith, President & CEO, PG&E utility Fong Wan, VP, Risk Initiatives, PG&E Corp. Ken Beckfire, Wasserstein Joe Sauvage, Investment Advisor, Lehman Bros. ENE players: Jeff Skilling Greg Whalley As new details become available, we'll pass them to you right away. SRS
