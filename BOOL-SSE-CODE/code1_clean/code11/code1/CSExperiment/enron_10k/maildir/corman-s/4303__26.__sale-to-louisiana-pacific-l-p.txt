The attached details a sale done late Friday (6/8/01) afternoon to L-P that needs to be entered into the Trade log. Per Paul Radous the "credit hold" will be less than $1.00/MWh. Christian Yoder is familiar with the needed confirmation. If anyone has any questions please let me know Monday (6/11) as I'll be traveling the remainder of the week. Thanks again for everyone's efforts. John
