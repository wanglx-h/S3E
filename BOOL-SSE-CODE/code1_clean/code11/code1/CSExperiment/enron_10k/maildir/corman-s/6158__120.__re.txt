Subject: RE:
I'll be at the meeting Friday. Caroline tells me that it is strictly a revenue review - no O&M. Do you want to go over just revenue with my team or both revenue/O&M? -----Original Message----- From: McCarty, Danny Sent: Wednesday, October 10, 2001 1:45 PM To: Corman, Shelley Subject: Shelley, I haven't seen any invitation list for Friday's Plan Review with Stan yet, but we are up at 10:00 and will go until 1:00. I'd like you to be in through the whole thing if possible. After that, do you think that you and I should walk through the whole plan with the key people in your group (and maybe Steve's)? Give me a call if you haven't received the Plan handouts by tomorrow. Thanks. Dan
