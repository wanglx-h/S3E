FYI. Thanks.

Gas Control was seeing what appeared to be a good flow rate but due to a calibration error between our Seimens Controller at Carlton and the Great Lakes computer we have actually been under burning. The Control Tech - Roger Salmi - is performing a calibration now and we should be sync'd up with Great Lakes this afternoon. I have passed this to Gas Control and they will make the necessary adjustments to correct the imbalance once Roger has completed the calibration. Tks - Mike W. - NNG Measurement Desk - 713-853-7742
