Subject: RE: Transwestern Decision
I just read the order. My congratulations to each of you as well. Job well done. Now hopefully the Commissioners will issue an order consistent with the judges decision. We all needed some good news! By the way Drew you should probably come up with a better description of your past experiences than "outhouse lawyer". -----Original Message----- From: Fossum, Drew Sent: Wednesday, October 24, 2001 5:51 PM To: 'CMoore@akingump.com'; 'rnuschler@akingump.com'; 'fkelly@gbmdc.com'; 'sstojic@gbmdc.com'; Porter, Gregory J.; Pavlou, Maria Cc: Derrick Jr., James; Walls Jr., Rob; Horton, Stanley; McCarty, Danny; Harris, Steven Subject: Transwestern Decision Frank, Steve, Charlie, Robin, Greg and Maria: CONGRATULATIONS on an outstanding result! I don't think I've ever in my days as an outhouse and inhouse lawyer worked with a team that was so cohesive and effective. That you guys did it with a group pulled together from two firms as well as in house lawyers is doubly impressive. We appreciate the long hours and sacrifices you all made to get this thing ready and try it in such a short time period. Your timing is impeccable, as having a little good news about Enron out in the marketplace is sorely needed right now! Thanks again guys! DF
