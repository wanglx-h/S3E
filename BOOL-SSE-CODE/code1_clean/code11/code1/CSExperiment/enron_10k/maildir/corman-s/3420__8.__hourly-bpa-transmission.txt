Subject: Hourly BPA Transmission
I've created a spreadsheet that will track Real Time BPA transmission reservations. I'll update the sheet each day to show total volume purchased and price at which it is purchased. I will also run a CARP report each day to ensure that the spreadsheet reflects Enpower exactly. Please feel free to give me suggestions if you'd like to see this added to or changed.
