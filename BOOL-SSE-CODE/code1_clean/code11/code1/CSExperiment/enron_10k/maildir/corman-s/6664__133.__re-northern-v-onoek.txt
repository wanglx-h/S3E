Subject: RE: Northern v. ONOEK
Britt, I scheduled a meeting per Drew's request with my team that deals with the Bushton area. Drew is going to review with them how we need to be careful about using the term "PTR calculation" for measurement error adjustments. We thought it would be good for you to attend as well. I want the team to understand how important it is that they are communicating accurately when talking about Bushton issues. Hopefully you can attend. Although I think the meeting may be scheduled to 10:00 a.m. instead of 9:30. Hopefully that works for you. Thanks.
