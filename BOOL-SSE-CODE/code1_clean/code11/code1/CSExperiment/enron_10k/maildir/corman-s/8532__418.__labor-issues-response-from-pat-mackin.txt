Subject: Labor Issues response from Pat Mackin
FYI. Michelle ---------------------- Forwarded by Michelle Cash/HOU/ECT on 10/31/2000 12:27 AM --------------------------- From: Stuart Zisman on 10/30/2000 04:56 PM To: hhaltom@andrews-kurth.com cc: Andrew Kelemen/HOU/ECT@ECT, Ron Coker/Corp/Enron@Enron, Don Miller/HOU/ECT@ECT, Michelle Cash/HOU/ECT@ECT, Dale Rasmussen/HOU/ECT@ECT, Karen E Jones/HOU/ECT@ECT, fmackin@aol.com Subject: Labor Issues response from Pat Mackin I spoke with Pat Mackin regarding the two representations that I mentioned in my Comments to the PSA. For those that are copied on this email that did not receive my comments, I have inserted the relevant language below: Labor Issues 1) Two different bidders made reference to different parts of Section 414 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. One was Section 414(t) dealing with being treated as a &single employer8 with another party and the other was Section 414(n) dealing with &leased employees.8 I have to assume that the two are somehow related. Is there something that we can concede in this area to provide our bidders some level of comfort without increasing Enron,s exposure?? According to Pat, the single employer representation (414(t)) should not be added to any of the PSA's because the Peaker and the Pastoria LLCs do not have any employees and ENA does not own more than 80% of LV CoGen. The second representation regarding 414(n) and Leased Employees is a representation that can be given by the Peaker and Pastoria LLCs (because the LLCs have no employees and don't lease any employees). It is unclear, however, whether it is applicable to LV CoGen. Ron/Andy would either of you please let me know whether LV CoGen "leases" any employees. Pat suggested that the HR person for LV CoGen should know. Stuart
