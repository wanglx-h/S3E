Subject: 2002 Capital IT Projects
Attached is a list of proposed capital IT projects for 2002. This list has been developed by the Commercial Support Systems group and is not intended to be a complete list. Please review the list and let me know if there are additional projects to add or there is a concern with projects on the list. I expect that we will discuss in Shelley's staff meeting tomorrow morning. Thanks, Brad
