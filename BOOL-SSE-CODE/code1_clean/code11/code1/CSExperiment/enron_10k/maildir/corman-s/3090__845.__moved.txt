Subject: moved
Hi everyone....I sent this to some of you already, so delete it if you already have the goods. I bought a house and moved this last weekend. Thanks to Bart, Brian, Lauren, Macey, and Vic. Your hard work was much appreciated. For everyone else, my new address is: 31369 SW Chia Loop, Wilsonville, OR 97070 New phone # is: 503-682-8061 Once I am settled, I will have a house warming shindig. I hope you are all doing well. Oh and to those of you who went to the coast a couple weeks ago......I had a great time. Thanks, Elizah
