Subject: Tranny Purchase from Snohomish on 11/29
Hi Guys, I'm sending this to you as an FYI because your names were on the deals I had to fix. We have two transmission deals with Snohomish PUD (see 469770.1 and 469791.1) that were entered under the Snohomissup counterparty. When searching for the counterparty in the listing, please be extra careful about the one you actually choose. If the wrong counterparty is added (even if it's the same customer, just a different moniker, as in this case), it will send someone (usually me or Virginia) on an unnecessary wild goose chase. Not hollering, just asking you to be careful. Caroline
