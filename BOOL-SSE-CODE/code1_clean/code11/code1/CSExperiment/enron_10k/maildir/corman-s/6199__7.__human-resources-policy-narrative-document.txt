Subject: Human Resources Policy Narrative Document
Karen per our earlier contact and conversations; A team of HR representatives have been working to develop new HR Policy documents. The attached document represents a consolidation of the proposed HR policy narratives. Your contribution as a communication expert is a vital piece of our overall effort. Karen Denne has been consulted on the matter. We would appreciate your review and recommendations as soon as possible. We have a preliminary deadline of Monday afternoon , July 30. Presentation to HR Executive Leadership will be Tuesday. For your perspective : We expect to enhance the communication value of these policy documents. The audience for these documents will be first and foremeost Enron's employees. We woud like to establish a positive, upbeat tone in first person present tense. We would like to create and purpetuate ease of reading. It is important that the legal and structural purpose of the HR policy survive the rewrites. The blue text in the documents represent "N-Form" links. These will provide hyperlinks to detailed information supporting the narrative document and its users' need for specifics. Please call if you have any questions: I can be reached in Houston on Friday @ 713- 853-9253 Thank you and I look forward to your insights, recommendations, and rewrite. Regards, Rj.
