Subject: hunting
Elk hunt this year is sceduled for Oct. 24-28th. We're putting in for some new territory this year and you all could be the first to harvest a nice big bull. I'll probably head over on wednesday or thursday night and hunt through the weekend. Hsu, no sidehill walking this year, unless there's a bucket of rice over there. Guzman, you missed it last year so I'm counting on you to be the first elk hunter in history to walk around in a big-ass sombrero with a side-shooter and a bottle of mezcal. Marcus, I don't give a shit what you do. Does anyone know if theres a Beaver game that weekend?
