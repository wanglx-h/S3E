I think either day is fine with me. Don't forget the parade on the 29th in the afternoon. I may bring my hoard. -----Original Message----- From: Halpin, Tom Sent: Wednesday, October 17, 2001 11:20 AM To: Thomas, Steve; Korbelik, Stephanie; Cohrs, Allen; Pritchard, John; Pavlou, Larry; Westfall, Roger; Oldenhuis, Frank; Dornan, Dari; Winckowski, Michele Cc: Blair, Lynn; Buchanan, John Subject: Follow up on the Nomination/Confirmation Process John Buchanan and Lynn Blair have offered to do a follow up session from yesterday's brown bag lunch to walk through the nomination and confirmation process. They have offered to come to Omaha on 10/29 or 10/30 for a face to face training session. Please let me know your availability on these days and I will get them lined up on whichever day looks to have the greatest turnout.
