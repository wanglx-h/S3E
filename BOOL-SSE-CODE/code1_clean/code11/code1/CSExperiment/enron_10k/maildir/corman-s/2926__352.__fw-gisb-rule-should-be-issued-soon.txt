The Office of Management and Budget has to assess, then sign off on, the rule as not constituting a major rule, which they are expected to do but haven't yet. Michael was hoping to hear back from OMB today or tomorrow, and issue the rule right after that. =================== Nancy Bagot Manager, Govt.
