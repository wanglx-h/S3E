Subject: California Messaging
Everyone, Enron has just launched an effort to educate California businesses on the California energy crisis, engage them in the debate, and coordinate our efforts in working toward "real solutions". A direct mail piece was sent out on Monday from Ken Lay. The materials that were sent are attached below. There will be follow up with the businesses that we have targeted. We also intend to make contact with non-business organizations in the coming weeks. PLEASE NOTE: The letters reference a California website that we have set up for businesses to receive additional information. DO NOT GO TO THIS SITE AS WE ARE TRACKING THE NUMBER OF HITS WE RECEIVE AND WE DON'T WANT A SKEWED NUMBER DUE TO ENRON EMPLOYEE HITS. If you have questions, please feel free to call me at 3-9104. Thanks! We also enclosed Ken Lay's San Francisco Chronicle op-ed (March 1st), and the Wall Street Journal article on the economic impact of the energy crisis (March 8th).
