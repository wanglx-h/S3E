Jim- The guy in the news article this morning was Kenneth J. Rice not Kenneth D. Rice of Enron fame. The media outlet that republished the article (totaltele.com) incorrectly called SynerG's Ken Rice the former Enron Executive. Frank and Ruth Lancaster found totaltele.com's error during a D&B/Lexus search on the company. -Scott ______ Scott Manuel Enron Broadband Services Phone (713) 853-6078 Cell (713) 859-0462 Fax (713) 646-8795 E-Mail: scott.manuel@enron.com
