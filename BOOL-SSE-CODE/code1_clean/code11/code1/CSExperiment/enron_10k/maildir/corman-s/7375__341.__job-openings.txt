Greg, I have been a dedicated Enron employee for two years. I was originally part of the Research group and now work for EIM Fundamentals. This is a very difficult and exciting time both for our company and for me as an employee. I would like to be more involved in this process. Does your office currently have ANY type of position where I can make most contribution to the company. Thank you, Yana Kristal Enron Industrial Markets (713) 345-8497
