Subject: Procedures Manauls for Measurement
Rod, Shelley mentioned that you indicated there were written procedures that we needed to check to see if being followed in regards to Measurement. A lot of new procedures came out of the Continuous Improvement effort and I have a copy of some. Is this what you are referring to? Do you happen to have a complete copy of the final report from all the areas? cvb
