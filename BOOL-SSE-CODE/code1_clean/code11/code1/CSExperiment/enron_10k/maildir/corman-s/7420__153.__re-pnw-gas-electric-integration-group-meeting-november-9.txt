The meeting location remains the same: The Paramount Hotel in downtown Portland. The address and phone number are listed below. My thanks again go to Calpine Corporation who will continue to serve as the host for the November meeting. Please ask for their corporate rate of $109 when making room reservations. The meeting remains focused on new generation, with almost all the speakers still available and willing to participate. The agenda now includes an updated Supply/Demand Outlook for the WCSB, a timely topic as we move into the winter heating season. The revised agenda is attached. You will be advised of any further changes in the agenda. Please let me know by November 1st if you plan on attending the meeting so that Calpine will have an accurate count for lunch. I look forward to seeing everyone on the 9th. If you have any questions please feel free to give me a call at 503-705-2168. Thank you for your patience in getting this meeting rescheduled.
