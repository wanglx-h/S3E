??? Yo Sweets, thought you might want to see these.? I also just replied and gave her your email address but you may want to contact her directly yourself.?

So, you got a new job?? I didn't know.? Congratulations!? I guess you are just getting adjusted.? Well, I'm about to have to get readjusted when I go back to work in a week or so.? I'm ready though. Martin said you had a good time on your honeymoon (aside from the big bruise on your ass).? I did the same thing in New Braunfels several years ago.? It looked worse than it felt.? Oh, could you give me Martin's email address at work?? Kevin keeps meaning to get back with him about his father's employment situation.? I'll make sure he does that tomorrow. I'm sending some wedding photos.? I'll have to send only a few at a time, so you will see other messages from me.? Let me know if you want to have any of them printed up.
