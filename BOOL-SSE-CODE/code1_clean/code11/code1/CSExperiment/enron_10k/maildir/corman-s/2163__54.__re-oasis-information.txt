Subject: RE: OASIS Information
According to this email, a "new OASIS system [will] soon . . . go online." I assume that this is the new operating procedures that was mentioned in the earlier emails to Sue. If we intend to file our ATC complaint, I therefore suggest that we do so tomorrow (June 1st), before the new OASIS system goes online. We are ready to file. Please advise.

Although we are allowing for TRM reporting now, please keep in mind the ISO rarely operates with a TRM. However on the few occasions that we do use a TRM, it will be reported here. * Forecasted Tie Meter Multipliers (TMM) are values used to represent the "adjustment" required to the power flows to effectively make the values recorded at the meters represent the delivered value at the physical location of the legal interconnection point. To understand this concept, it is important to understand that the meters are not always located right at the legal interconnection point, in fact they can be miles away.

This TRM value will be included in the daily PMI postings prior to the day ahead market." Also, can you define "Forecasted Tie Meter Multipliers"? Thanks, Dave
