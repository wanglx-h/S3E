We will have the phones for this weekend for Enron Canada. We will get the phones at 6 on Friday (or thereabouts) and will have them till 6 on Sunday morning (or thereaboot). Same as before. We need to update the calgary log on explorer and the written log (in the white Canada binder) if there are any rerates. Please contact Bill Greenizian, John Zufferli or myself with questions. I will be in Las Vegas through Sunday but will be reachable on my cell at 503-887-3449 to answer any questions. Thanks, Bill
