Attached is the report of scheduled quantity changes made after the end of the gas day. There is one more that is not on the list that was completed yesterday, but Lynda has not had time to update. -----Original Message----- From: Laferla, Lynda Sent: Wednesday, March 06, 2002 4:28 PM To: Nacey, Sheila Subject: Manual Scheduled Items - Febr.
