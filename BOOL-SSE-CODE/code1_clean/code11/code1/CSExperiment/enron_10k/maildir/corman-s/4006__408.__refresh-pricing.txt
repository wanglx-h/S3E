Subject: Refresh pricing
Kinko's wants their pricing refreshed for their Reliant and TXU sites only. I need to know the fixed $MWh price if we assume a 50% renewable product in TXU and a 100% renewable product in Reliant's service area. I am trying to fill out the attached template that Larry sent to me with my gen only price refreshed, some Price to beat estimates I ran for him and your new renewable power quotes. Thanks Kay
