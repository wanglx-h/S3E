Greg: Implement Tradeco. Determine if Dynegy is willing to lend $850 to $900 million against TransWestern Contact Moody's and ask how much equity we need Tap all potential sources of equity: - Dynegy - Federal Reserve/Treasury - Banks (Citi, Chase) - Industry players (unlikely in time required) If funds are likely, get stay from Moody's until Monday Tell me what you want me to do and I'll get after it.
