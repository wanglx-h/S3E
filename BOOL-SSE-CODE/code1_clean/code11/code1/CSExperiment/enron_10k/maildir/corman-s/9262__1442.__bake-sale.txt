Subject: Bake Sale!
To raise money for our family we adopted for Christmas, we are having a bake sale at the filing cabinets by the Christmas tree ( in origination) All goodies are $1.00 a piece. This is going to be on the honor system, so help yourselves!!! Supply is limited, but I heard that Jeff Richter made a mean cake w/cream cheese frosting. You go, Jeff!! Theresa
