Yeah, I think I left a bunch of shit in those cupboards that night. I miss that apartment to because it was so nice however, I love where I live now. I never leave downtown anymore. I only go out to places downtown pretty much and I don't have to drive if I want to go out for a few drinks. I love northwest. So how is it working out with the Kim thing. Are you going to move out soon? As far as working nights goes the first night went fine and I was not even tired. I am working tonight and Saturday night also. I have next weekend off which will be nice. Once I am up to speed I wont have to work nights. i will be working half the time nights and half the time days, so that will be a little better. And it will be awesome to have a six day break once a month. Not to mention the 10% raise! Anyway have a great weekend. Hey and if you are interested in grabbing lunch on Monday or a drink after work I have the day off. Give me a call if you are interested. Otherwise I will catch up to ya later!
