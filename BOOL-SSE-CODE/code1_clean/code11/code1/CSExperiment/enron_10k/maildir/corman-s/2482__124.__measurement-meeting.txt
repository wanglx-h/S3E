Subject: Measurement Meeting
I talked with Barb Bishoff who is setting up the Measurement meeting for Mary Kay and Dave Neubauer. She said it will probably be next week since she is having trouble getting both Mary Kay and Dave at the same time. I told her it was critical that Shelley be in the meeting. I told her Steve, Rick and I are optional for this discussion. Thanks. Lynn
