Subject: RE: Outage for August 2001
I don't see anything for 8/4 either. I checked scheduling. Did you talk to Bill W. ? If you want I'll call downstairs and ask more questions. d -----Original Message----- From: Thompson, Virginia Sent: Friday, September 21, 2001 11:21 AM To: Scholtes, Diana Subject: Outage for August 2001 Diana- We just got a call from Steve at PGE regarding the following: There was a scheduled outage on the DC tie on August 4, 2001 that was supposed to run thru HE 12, but that outage actually lasted until HE 16. PGE is saying that we sank at Burbank but that Burbank doesn't want to pay PGE. I'm not sure what this means or how this is our problem, but if you know anything about it, please let me know. If you want Steve's extention, it's x7410. Thanks, Virginia
