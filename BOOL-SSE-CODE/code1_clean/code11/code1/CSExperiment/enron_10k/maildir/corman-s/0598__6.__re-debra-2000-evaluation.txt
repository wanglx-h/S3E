Subject: RE: Debra 2000 Evaluation
Estalee, based on the last meetings we had on PRC, what is your suggestion on how to handle this? We need to discuss. I will be back in the office on Tuesday. Do you have any time? Thanks.

Through the PRC process they should have given feedback to support this and therefore her rating should reflect their feedback.

We have seen Debra work hard to get up to speed on our various interconnects and other procedures this year. Debra has sharpened her focus on our business, gained competence in all areas requested, and is now able to support the team when needed. We therefore request that this report be removed from her file. Please let me know if anything more is needed to complete this updating for Debra. Thank you, Janet McDaniel for the South Central Team <Embedded Picture (Device Independent Bitmap)>
