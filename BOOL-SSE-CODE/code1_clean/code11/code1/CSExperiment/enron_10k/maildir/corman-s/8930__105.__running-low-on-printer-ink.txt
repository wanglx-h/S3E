Subject: Running low on printer ink?
[IMAGE] [IMAGE] [IMAGE] [IMAGE]When I heard you could save money by buying cartridges on the internet, I thought it was some kind of scam. But when they arrived so quickly, I was amazed! I love the internet economy, and you guys especially. --Trujillo Squab, Small Businessman I run the office for a small group of lawyers and I've gone through more supply companies than I can remember over the last few years. But then my cousin from Seattle told me about All You Can Ink. Now I can finally rest! You've got one devoted customer right here. --John Wilkes, Assistant Legal Manager You know, I'm so tired of the same song and dance; one company after the other has promised me deals on various products. And then they disappear. But All You Can Ink actually delivers! And your customer service department answered my questions, in common english. I am floored! --Julie Oliva-Deportamentito, Fireman [IMAGE]Last December I was hospitalized in a diving accident and I haven't been able to easily leave the house for months. Shopping is a real problem for me, but with All You Can Ink, I've found it a snap to order new ribbons, and they arrive in perfect condition, practically quicker than I'd be able to get them myself! --Frances Reeves, Linguist Our company makes a lot of prints. I mean a whole lot. We spit out like four thousand sheets a day, on an easy day! And you can imagine how much we spend on ink. ...I didn't know if the quality would really be that reliable when I first ordered... but now we buy it all from All You Can Ink. Everything. --Connie Turbulance, Advanced Graphic Things Are Us. [IMAGE] [IMAGE] [IMAGE] Click here if you no longer want to receive gifts or special offers from Send 4 Fun.
