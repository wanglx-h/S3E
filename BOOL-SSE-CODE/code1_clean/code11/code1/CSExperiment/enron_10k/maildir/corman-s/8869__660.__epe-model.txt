Subject: EPE Model
There have been many occasions where individuals have not saved the model at the end of the day. This means that the last one...two...FIVE hours are not updated. I then have to go back and enter the data off the historical scrapes as well as the actual econ deals themselves. You can imagine how frustrating this is for me...... It's VERY EASY to save the model and time consuming to update it all after the fact. Besides annoying me, it also looks bad to EPE when they get a model that is wrong. Do not forget to save!!!!!! It is completely sloppy and totally unacceptable. Save and save often....... Jesse
