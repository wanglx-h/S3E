Subject: RE:
I was just curious.............. I don't want to see you go. I too, haven't spoke to Stan for a week or so. He's looked awful stressed lately. I'm just trying to stay low and out of his way. I'll talk to you later. Bob -----Original Message----- From: Corman, Shelley Sent: Wednesday, February 27, 2002 3:46 PM To: Hayes, Robert Subject: RE: I haven't visited with Stan lately. Why do you ask? I know he has a lot going and doesn't have the crystal ball that I and others are looking for. I'll try to sit Down with him next week. I'm not planning on doing anything this week. -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net)
