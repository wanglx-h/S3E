The Global Performance Management Team has proposed that Ken Lay do a Broadcast Voice Mail concerning the Year End Global Performance Management Process. I have drafted a memo with the proposed content and am attaching in hopes that you can review and edit. If you respond as to the memo by Monday 29 October it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you, Allyson Zykorie
