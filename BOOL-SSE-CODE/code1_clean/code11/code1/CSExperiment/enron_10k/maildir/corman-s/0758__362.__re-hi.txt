Subject: RE: hi!
That is weird. I never see any of your friends. (Except for that time I saw Julie and Marcus.) I suppose that's because I hang out at places where there's girls and your friends are afraid of girls. -----Original Message----- From: Mark.Guzman@enron.com [mailto:Mark.Guzman@enron.com] Sent: Wednesday, April 18, 2001 2:50 PM To: Katie.Trullinger@wfsg.com Subject: RE: hi! Did I tell you I saw Kathy Chaney at Cobalt Lounge about 3 weeks ago, and then the next day i was that Prisilla (sp?) at Scooters? I just thought it was wierd seeing two of your friends on two succesive evenings.
