Subject: Houston Area Car Rental Availability
Due to the recent flooding in the Houston area, there has been a sharp demand in the need for rental cars. Availability in the area has been severely limited, increasing the burden on effected employees. Together, Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS), HR-Work Life, Community Relations and The Travel Agency in the Park, have arranged for a limited number of vehicles to be reserved at Intercontinental Airport - Houston (IAH) through Enron,s preferred car rental providers, National Car Rental and Alamo Rent-a-Car. To obtain a rental vehicle, please contact The Travel Agency in the Park at 713-860-1189 between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. and ask for Sheryl Blackman. The reserved vehicles are being held outside of the normal reservation system and will only be available through the Travel Agency in the Park. The Enron Shuttle will depart for IAH from in front of the Enron Building, today, June 13 and tomorrow, June14, at 12:00 p.m., 2:00 p.m., and 4:00 p.m. Enron employees renting a vehicle for personal use may take advantage of Enron,s negotiated corporate rates, which include Loss/Damage Waiver and liability insurance.
