Subject: WSCC E-Tag Compliance
Mary, I serve as Vice-Chair on the NERC Interchange Subcommittee (Policy 3 Tagging) and attention has been brought to us on WSCC compliance to NERC Tagging for hourly transactions. WSCC is less than 50% compliant as of now. I want to check with you and the West Desk that Enron supports E-tagging in the West and is ready or is already in compliance. As you will note in the attached memo: "A survey of PSEs doing business in WSCC will be conducted in the near future". Please provide me any comments and feedback I should be aware of regarding the tagging requirements in WSCC. Thank You ---------------------- Forwarded by Charles Yeung/HOU/ECT on 03/06/2001 07:39 AM --------------------------- Gordon Scott <gordon.scott@nerc.com>@nerc.com on 03/06/2001 06:56:54 AM Sent by: owner-interchange@nerc.com To: interchange@nerc.com cc: Subject: WSCC E-Tag Compliance Dear Interchange Subcommittee, Attached is a letter from the WSCC's Bill Comish to IS Chair Byrd on compliance with Policy 3 and E-Tagging. The IS also requested the status of the WSCC's companies compliance with E-Tagging. The WSCC surveyed their companies and those lists are also attached. This issue is on the Operating Committee's March agenda as an informational item. Thanks, Gordon. - WSCC E-Tag Compliance Letter from Bill Comish to IS Pol3_compliance_ltr1.doc - WSCC E-Tag Compliance List of Companies Surveyed from Bill ComishCA_TP-POL3COMP-WSCC1.xls
