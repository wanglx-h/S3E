Hey we are going to Truluck's for all you can eat stone crab claws tonight in honor of my 32nd birthday. I think it is about $35 each for the all you can eat claws or they also have steak, lobster, and seafood. Let me know if you want to go so Zooey can make the reservation (7pm). And ken no song although i might play it tonight if i get drunk enough -----Original Message----- From: Shulklapper, Ken Sent: Monday, October 22, 2001 2:31 PM To: Cuilla, Martin Subject: Jet Plane Do you have the song on your work computer?
