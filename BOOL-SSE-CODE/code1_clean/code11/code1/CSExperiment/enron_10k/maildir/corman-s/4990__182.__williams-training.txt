Subject: Williams Training
Donna, Bob Burleson had a conversation with Debra yesterday concerning the Williams training on MOPS. Williams has all the maps and diagrams including volumes they need, all Williams wants is training on the day to day Nominations, Confirmations and Scheduling. So the need for a hand out or packet of information is not needed. Thanks for offering to help. Thanks: John Buchanan
