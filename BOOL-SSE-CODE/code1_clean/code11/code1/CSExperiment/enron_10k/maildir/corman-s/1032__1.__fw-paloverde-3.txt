Subject: FW: PaloVerde 3
this just in from our nuke guy. Subject: PaloVerde 3 Palo Verde 3 began their refueling outage this past weekend. During inspections at Mode 5 (cold shutdown) they discovered a couple cracks (leaks) in their reactor coolant system. One was at a temperature detector, the other was at the pressurizer. The refueling outage had been expected to last about a month (restart 10/30/01). These cracks may delay restart due to very heightened NRC concern about this kind of cracking. We will keep you posted on plans and schedule changes for this outage. Dan
