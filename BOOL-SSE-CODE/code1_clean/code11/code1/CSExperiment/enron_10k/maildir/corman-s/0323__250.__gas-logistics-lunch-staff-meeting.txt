Subject: Gas Logistics Lunch & Staff Meeting
Our team holiday potluck luncheon is scheduled for Tuesday, December 11 at 11:30 AM. So dust off those cookbooks and sign up to bring a culinary creation. The sign-up sheet is located outside Ricki's workstation (4268A). The buffet will be set up in 42C1 (the gas control presentation room). Room 42C2 is also reserved for seating. Following our luncheon, we will have a Gas Logistics staff meeting at 1 PM in 39C1. We can discuss any Enron updates and I will do my best to address any questions and concerns that you have. At the end of our staff meeting, we'll hold our holiday raffle drawing. We have lots of fun prizes, including many sets of sports tickets. All Gas Logistics employee names will be entered. You need not be present to win. Finally, I want to fill you in on my upcoming journey. My husband and I have been trying to adopt a young girl from Kazakhstan into our family. The paperwork and red tape have seemed unending and I was having doubts whether it would ever happen. Early this week I received the call that I need to travel to Kazakhstan next week to pick her up. While I am excited to complete the adoption, I'm not terribly thrilled with the timing of being gone over the holidays and away from work at this time. At our staff meeting, I can address any questions you have about whom to call in my absence. I'm looking forward to our get together next week. To the extent that you aren't able to make the luncheon, let me take this opportunity to wish you and your family a happy, safe and relaxing holiday season.
