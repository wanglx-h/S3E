Subject: Invitation to Present Feb. 21, 2002 Keynote Address at the Spring
 2002 University of Texas Energy Finance Conference
Mr. Whalley: Greetings. Further to my discussions with your colleague Vince Kaminski, I write you at this time in my capacity as Director of the Center for Energy Finance Education and Research (CEFER) at the McCombs School of Business, University of Texas at Austin. Following the first University of Texas Energy Finance Conference in Feb. 2001, my colleagues and I are planning a second annual practitioner-industry Conference in the Spring 2002, scheduled for 2/21 - 2/22/02, planning for which is on-going with your Enron colleagues. The Conference will kick off with a dinner and keynote address Thur. evening, then continue all day Fri. I write to extend an invitation for you to be the keynote speaker at the Thur. evening dinner, or the Fri. lunch if your schedule precludes a Thur. evening presentation. Although the format for the 2002 conference may differ from that used in Feb. 2001, for completeness I enclose herewith a copy of the 2001 Conference Program. You may recall meeting my UT Finance Dept. colleagues and I during our day-long visit to Enron two years ago on Aug. 27, 1999. I look forward to seeing you again, this time on the UT campus. With Best Regards, Ehud Ronn
