Subject: Discussion forum and outage reporting
Group, Our discussion forum notes as a group are significantly improved in the past 3 weeks in many areas. I believe communication in the group at shift changes is improving and is quite good in general. However, there is always room for more improvement. Specifically, other traders in the group and on the floor would benefit from more detailed information regarding outages. Please try to include the reason for a plant derate as well as the ETR when a unit is lost. I would also highly recommend notifying the cash desk in the region affected by the outage, either by email or verbally. An important outage was recently missed by both the real-time group and another cash desk on the floor. Real-time had ready access to the information concerning the outage but did not pass that information on to others in the group at the shift change or others on the floor. In this case, such poor communication simply made us look foolish. We work hard for (and justly deserve) the solid reputation we have on the floor. Let's make sure we do the little things to maintain it. Again, keep up the good work. Bill
