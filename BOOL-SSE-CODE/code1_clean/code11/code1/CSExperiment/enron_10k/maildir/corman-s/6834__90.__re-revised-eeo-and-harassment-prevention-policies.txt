Subject: RE: Revised EEO and Harassment Prevention policies
I would not want any of our policies to address what is "unlawful," as I believe that is a matter for a court. Instead, our policies should state what we want to have in them, and leave the issue of legality to others. Plus, I wouldn't want any admission of unlawful conduct in our policies.

Lizzette, I noted that you placed a question mark next to the "Unlawful (under FMLA)" link. It is my understanding that the FMLA policy narrative and the related links are going to be revised/updated by Kriste Sullivan and Chris Rahaim. In our last Project N-Form meeting, we agreed that Kriste and Chris would communicate their changes to Anne Labbe and Sarah Zarkowsky (members of the Content team). Please let me know if you have additional changes. Thanks again for your assistance! Wendy << File: 10.16.01 Revisions to Green policies.doc >> << File: 10.24.01 Revisions to Green Links.doc >>
