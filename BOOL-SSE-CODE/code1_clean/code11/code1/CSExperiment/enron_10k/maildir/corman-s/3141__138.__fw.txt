Please advise when I will receive my vacation owe to me of 73 hours, and when I will receive my severance? Especially since I was terminated from my job before Enron officially declared bankruptcy. Ashley Kerr, HR Specialist replied via email stating that; Per the HR Service Connection the process of paying vacation out 30 days later is to ensure that any outstanding balances owed by the employee can be taken care of (for i.e. - any Energizer charges you have in November will be taken out of you vacation on 12/15.) But it was not what Ms Kerr, HR Specialist outlined in her handwriting the day I was terminated on November 16, 2001. She explained and outlined the dates of what amount I would be receiving on the payroll of November 30, 2001, December 15, December 31, 2001 and on January 31, 2001. Didn't you all received a check on November 30th? I hope that Fastow and Skilling didn't received any kind of payment on November 30, 2001 from Enron's payroll. I await for your response, so that I may take care of my bills. Thanks, Maggie Valles
