Subject: Scheduling Activity Report
Group, Recently we have had problems with the Scheduling Activity Report. In speaking with Will Smith, it is important that we include the appropriate date, the correct regions, the ST-Whourly desk, and the correct group (24 inc). Without an entry in the desk field, this report is guaranteed to take 25-30 minutes to run! Obviously not all deals will pull in (deals under ST-Cali, ST-Bom, or ST-Services) when our desk is specified. It is STILL the responsibility of the trader running the report to "tie out" the total dollar amount (not mw) to the inc and service sheets, exactly. A detailed explanantion of a deviation in this dollar amount is expected (ie. extra revenue is a result of congestion, or extra revenue is a result of purchases from imbalance at zero...etc.). If you have any questions on this report or any other daily task. Please let me know. Thank you, B Williams
