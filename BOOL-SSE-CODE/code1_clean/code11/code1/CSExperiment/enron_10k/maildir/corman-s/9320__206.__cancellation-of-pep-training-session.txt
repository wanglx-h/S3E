Subject: Cancellation of PEP Training Session
Please send to all ETS Gas Logistics In the never ending world of changes at Enron, upper management has determined that we will not be using the PEP system for feedback this year. I apologize that this decision was made after you put time into selecting reviewers and completing reviews. I have not received word on whether ETS year-end feedback will occur in any alternate form. As a result of this development, the feedback training session for this afternoon is cancelled.
