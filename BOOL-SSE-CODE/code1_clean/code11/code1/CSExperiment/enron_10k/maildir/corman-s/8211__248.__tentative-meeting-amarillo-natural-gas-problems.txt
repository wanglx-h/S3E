Subject: Tentative Meeting - Amarillo Natural Gas problems
We have tenatively scheduled a meeting with Lynn to discuss the problems we are experiencing with Amarillo Natural Gas. The reason it is tenatively is because Lynn has Jury Duty selection on Monday and if picked, she will not be here...maybe! Date: Monday, Oct. 29th Time: 9:00 am Place: Lynn's Office Any questions, please let me know. Randy
