Subject: Opera
Dave Maxey invited us to join him and Ann Marie at the opera on November 3 -- Tannh?user Opera in three acts Music and libretto by Richard Wagner Sung in German with English surtitles He suggested doing the dinner first (starts around 5:30, he thinks) -- they have 4 Founders Box seats. He also granted permission to leave earlier if the Wagner was too much to take after two acts. I told him I did not know what we had on the schedule, and I would check with you. Let's discuss when we visit next. L, T
