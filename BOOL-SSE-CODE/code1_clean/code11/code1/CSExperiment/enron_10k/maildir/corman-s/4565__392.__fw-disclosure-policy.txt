Subject: FW: Disclosure Policy
Okay, Who has expertise in this area? Please advise so that I can provide Geoff a point of contact for further assistance. Thank you. Irma Alvarez HR Svc Connection Ext.3-1543 -----Original Message----- From: Baines, Geoff Sent: Monday, November 19, 2001 10:14 AM To: HR Service Connection Subject: Disclosure Policy Has anybody produced a 'disclosure policy' for the Data Protection Act or a general policy on this subject? If you could send me a copy i would appreciate it. Also, the engineering constuction IR issue at Lundbeck chemicals, over 2nd tier payments, is, according to my sources unlikely to spread to other sites. However if you have any 'intelligence' on this subject, i would appreciate a call or an e-mail. Thanks, Geoff Baines ETOL
