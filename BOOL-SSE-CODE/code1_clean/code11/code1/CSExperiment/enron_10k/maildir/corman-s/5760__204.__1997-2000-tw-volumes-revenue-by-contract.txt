Subject: 1997-2000 TW Volumes & Revenue By Contract
Sarah, Attached is TW revenue detail by contract for the years 1997-2000. At the bottom of the schedule, I've made a simplistic cut between short-term/long-term based on the expiration date. For example, for calendar year 1997: Short-term = Firm contracts with contract expiration date before 12/31/98 + all IT & PNR revenues Long-term = Firm contracts with expiration dates in 1999 and beyond. Same logic for years, 1998, 1999, 2000. Call me at x37083 if you have questions.
