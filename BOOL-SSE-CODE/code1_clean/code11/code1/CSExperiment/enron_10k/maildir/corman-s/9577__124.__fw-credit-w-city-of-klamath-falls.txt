Subject: FW: Credit w/ City of Klamath Falls
Stewart, I left you an envelope with information regarding the City of K. Falls. Not sure if you forwarded it to anyone to begin the process for credit approval. Can you please respond to Ray's E-mail? Let me know if there is something else you need me to do. ds -----Original Message----- From: Grinberg, Ray [mailto:Ray.Grinberg@PacifiCorp.com] Sent: Friday, October 19, 2001 9:39 AM To: Scholtes, Diana Subject: Credit w/ City of Klamath Falls Hey Diana- What's up with getting credit with the City of Klamath Falls? I didn't hear back from you the other day. It sure would be nice to get that in place. Is there someone there I need to talk to? thanks, Ray Grinberg
