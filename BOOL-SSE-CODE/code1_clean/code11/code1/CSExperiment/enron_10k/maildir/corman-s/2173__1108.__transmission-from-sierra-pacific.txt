Subject: Transmission from Sierra Pacific
We are trying to get long term transmission service from Sierra Pacific for LV Cogen. Sierra Pacific claims that numerous parties are ahead of us in the queue. We disagree (for some fairly complex technical reasons that I won't detail here). Sierra Pacific won't offer us transmission service until it resolves the requests that are ahead of us in the queue. At this time, we are planning to keep the project and may have difficulty getting financing if we can't get the transmission service. It is my understanding that we have exhausted all negotiating opportunities with Sierra to resolve this issue. I would like to have Bracewell and Patterson draft a FERC filing to resolve this issue. However, I have been told that EPMI cannot make such a filing due to the pending merger. Paul and Sarah - I'd like to confirm that we have indeed exhausted all negotiating opportunities and that we can't file anything against Sierra.
