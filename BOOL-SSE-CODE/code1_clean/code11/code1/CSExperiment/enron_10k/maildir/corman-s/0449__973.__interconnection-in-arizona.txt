Subject: Interconnection in Arizona
Mary, I am working with Jeff Golden and Marc Pana in EES Corporate Development. Marc asked me to send you a list of potential substations for interconnection of mobile generation in blocks of 25 MW to 50 MW. Here is a tentative list. Please feel free to suggest any other location you think is suitable for trading power in Palo Verde (either directly or with power displacement). Thanks for your attention.
