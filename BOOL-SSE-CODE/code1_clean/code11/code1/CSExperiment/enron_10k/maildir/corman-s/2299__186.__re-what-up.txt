Hey Rob, sorry if I sounded a little weird on the phone the other night. My boyfriend and I were in the middle of a really heavy discussion when you called. He was standing right by me, (upset with me), so it was a little awkward. It was great to hear from you and I'd still like to meet you for a drink sometime after work.
