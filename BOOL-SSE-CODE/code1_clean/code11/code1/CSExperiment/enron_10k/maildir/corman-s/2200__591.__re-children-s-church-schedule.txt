Subject: RE: Children's Church schedule
I'm fine with not having Children's Church Palm Sunday -- recognizing that we won't have CC for 3 weeks then. I'll adjust the curriculum notes accordingly and we'll pick up with Children's Church on April 14. -----Original Message----- From: BLT12139@aol.com [mailto:BLT12139@aol.com] Sent: Monday, March 18, 2002 4:39 PM To: Corman, Shelley Subject: Fwd: Children's Church schedule Shelley: Read Patty's comments, and I will call you in the next day or two to discuss.
