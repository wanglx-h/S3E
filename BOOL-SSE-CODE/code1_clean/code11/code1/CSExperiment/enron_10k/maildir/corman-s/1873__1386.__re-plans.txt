Subject: Re: plans
Dave, I am planning on driving up after I get off work on Saturday morning and should be up in Seattle by about 10:30 or so. I will probably just go to Jorge's and crash out until you arrive. Have you guys made any plans for Saturday night? I talked to Donald, he wasn't aware that you were even coming but he said he would like to do something with all of us. We actually talked about maybe going skiing on sunday I don't know if you would be intereseted in doing that.
