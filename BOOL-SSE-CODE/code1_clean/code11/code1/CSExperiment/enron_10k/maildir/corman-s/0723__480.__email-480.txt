I inadvertently tripped over the NNG website today--it makes no mention of Dynegy's ownership. The address is www.nng.enron.com <http://www.nng.enron.com> and I got there through a link from www.enron.com <http://www.enron.com>. Not a huge problem, , but it is confusing. I didn't look, but Dynegy has its own NNG website, right? DF
