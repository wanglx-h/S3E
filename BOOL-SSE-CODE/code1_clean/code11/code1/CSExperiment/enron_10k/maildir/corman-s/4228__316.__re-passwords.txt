Sorry for the delay. My wallet and checkbook were stolen on Fr night & I spent all day yesterday getting things in order...after the thief charged $6000 on my credit and debit cards! Remember that conversation we had about 2001. I did little research on Compuserve and AOL. Both have acess numbers in Almaty Kazaknstan -- where I'll be at least 1 week of my journey. Looks like they both use the same access numbers and both charge a $6 connect fee. So I don't see the advantage of adding AOL -- unless you see something I don't. Here's the catch -- neither has service from Moscow. So I'll be out of lunch in Moscow unless I can find an alternative ISP. I'm at regional type hotels in Kazakstan. But, I'm staying at the Grand Marriott in Moscow. Surely they have some sort of ISP access. My current ISP is Compuserve.

My Enron password is also chad4erb. I'm at the house (281-531-0385) if you need any other info. -----Original Message----- From: McFarland, Jean Sent: Sun 12/9/2001 12:55 PM To: Corman, Shelley Cc: Subject: passwords Shelley -- I need your passwords!
