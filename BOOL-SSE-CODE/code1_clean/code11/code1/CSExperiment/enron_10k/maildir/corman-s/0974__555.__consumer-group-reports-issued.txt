Subject: Consumer Group Reports Issued
On March 19th, the Foundation for Taxpayer & Consumer Rights published a report in it's Bailout Watch newsletter (Special Report: The Manufactured Energy Crisis) concluding that California's energy crisis has been manufactured by "energy firms." A copy of the report is attached and is also available on the organization's website at www.consumerwatchdog.org. Today, the Consumer Federation of America released a report (Behind the Headlines of Electricity Restructuring: A Story of Green, Irresponsibility and Mismanagement of a Vital Service in a Vulnerable Market) asking policymakers to "rethink" the move toward retail electric competition. A copy of the report is available at their website at www.consumerfed.org or www.consumerfed.org/calmkt.pdf.
