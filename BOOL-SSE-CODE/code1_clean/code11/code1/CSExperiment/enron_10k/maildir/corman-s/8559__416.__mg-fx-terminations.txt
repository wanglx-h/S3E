Hoyt, Under the Older Workers Benefits Protection Act, we must provide demographic information to persons over the age of 40 who are offered severance packages in exchange for a release. We need the title/position and the age of the persons holding those positions for the persons who were offered a package as well as the persons who were not offered a package. We will provide this data to persons over 40 to validate their releases. Thanks. Michelle
