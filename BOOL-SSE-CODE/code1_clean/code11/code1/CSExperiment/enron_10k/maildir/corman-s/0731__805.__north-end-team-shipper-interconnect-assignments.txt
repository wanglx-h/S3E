Subject: North End Team Shipper/Interconnect Assignments
Team, I would like for you to review the attached Shipper assignment list. With Renee leaving and Pat still on a learning curve, I wanted to throw out some possibilities and get your input. I did not spend a lot of time on interconnects, so you may want to look at those closely. I did talk with John, Terry, Raetta and Larry for input. Please review, discuss and set up some time to visit with me about your comments. Thanks. Lynn
