Subject: WP-02 Data Request
Paul, I am working with Ray Kindley on this matter. I am replying for PGP and it's members who are parties to the rate case, including Seattle City Light. We received a hard copy of your three data requests regarding the Joint Customer Testimony on either Saturday, March 10th or Monday, March 12th. We failed to date stamp initially, which is why I am not sure which day we received it. Today, I received amended versions of those data requests. Because of the confusion I intend to respond only to the amended version on Tuesday, March 20th, which splits the difference between the initial and the amended version due dates. Please let me know if there is any problem with handling the responses in this manner. Thank you in advance for your courtsey. Jay T. Waldron jwaldron@schwabe.com Kelly C.
