Subject: EOL visit
We had a good visit with the FERC staff yesterday. Their questions primarily focused on the business aspects of EOL (for example, how the different business units of trading and accounting/back office interface with the software and engineering aspects of EOL). The attorney had two outstanding questions: 1. What regulations govern EOL or the trades done on EOL? 2. What types of internal controls are in place with regard to risk management of Enron's gas and power trading. For example, what is the ability of Enron to take a position that could potentially affect the industry as a whole? We plan to coordinate a possible call to the FERC attorney by regarding the regulation question. In addition, Steve Kean plans to coordinate a call to the attorney with Rick Buy (or other appropriate risk management personnel.)
