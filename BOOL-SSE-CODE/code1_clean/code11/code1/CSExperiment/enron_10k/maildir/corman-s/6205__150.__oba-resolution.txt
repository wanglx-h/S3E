Thanks for you voice message. I have been traveling the last couple days and thought Tim forwarded the memo & invoice on Monday. In reality, he was on a trip with some Gulf South folks & just returned to the office today. He sent the attached memo and invoice this morning. I was a bit off with my timing -- as September accounting close is tomorrow. Thanks again for your help in resolving this matter.
