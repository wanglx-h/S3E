Subject: LV for Sat and Sun
We have length for Saturday and Sunday at Mead. We can take this into SP-15 or look to sell it at PV or 4C. PSCO has been buying, as have PAC, APS, and PNM, POWX etc...Daily's traded up near $195 for Sun and Mon. Be careful with transmission and deal entry (APS website requires Microsoft Explorer not Netscape) and maximize this reasonably priced energy. Saturday LV schedule: HE6-10 7mw HE11-16 52mw HE17-24 7mw OASIS #01019041 Enpower #552482, 552492, 552515 Price is $140 Sunday LV schedule: HE11-16 17MW OASIS #01019048 Enpower #552750, 552762, 552772, 552772 Price is $135 Thanks, Bill
