-----Original Message----- From: Free, Sydney [mailto:SFree@tractebelusa.com] Sent: Tuesday, February 12, 2002 9:36 AM To: 'scorman@enron.com' Subject: Trustee stuff Hi Shelley: How are things going at home? I hope ya'll are settling in a bit and things are going smoother. We had our trustee meeting last night and the subject of inventory came up. I remember two or three years ago, we took an extensive inventory and that each head of each group at the church inventoried their items. I remember doing the sanctuary and Steve doing the music inventory. Do you know where all the paperwork is? Do you have it on your computer or does Lisa or someone else? If so, could you email it to me? or give me the originals? Jim said he didn't see it in the stuff you gave him. He also can't find the Trustee Master Binder; do you know where it is? Thanks. Syd see you Saturday depending on how my gum surgery goes on Thursday.
