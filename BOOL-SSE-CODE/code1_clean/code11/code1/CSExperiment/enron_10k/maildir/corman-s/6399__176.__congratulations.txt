Subject: Congratulations
Greg- I read about your recent promotion at Enron and I wanted to congratulate you. Based upon the time we spent together last year, I think it's well deserved. Next time you're in New York, give me a ring. I'd like to buy you lunch and see if they are ways we can work together going foward.
