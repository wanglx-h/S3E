Michelle - Since this deal is beginning to heat up again, I wanted to get you back in the loop. The earlier e-mail is a good overview of the structure proposed for ownership. Some minor movement of employees may be required, but it is not anticipated at this time that many, if any, employees will be terminated. A few key individuals have change of control severance agreements, but overall there is no change of control trigger affecting the employee base. I have attached a copy of the Legal Risk Memo I provided to Mark H. in advance of approvals. It contains a summary of the deal and a general outline of the identified issues, including two related to pension issues in Quebec. I thought this might be helpful as a kick-start back into the deal. Please let me know if you should need anything further or have any questions.
