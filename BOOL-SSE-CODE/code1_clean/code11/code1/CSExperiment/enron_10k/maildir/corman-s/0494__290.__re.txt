If you don't mind that would help out. Does that mean you would stay at my house tonight? Do you need to go home and get your things? I can't wait to see you again. -----Original Message----- From: Geaccone, Tracy Sent: Monday, October 29, 2001 9:28 AM To: Harris, Steven Subject: I can't wait to see you tonight. If you have alot of things to do at home, I don't mind driving to your house after Jackie's conference. I have an Azurix 2002 Plan review from 2:30-4:30, so I will not be at your staff meeting. I should be around until then. Love you, Red
