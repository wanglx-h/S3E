Subject: Media General Update
Andy and Michelle: I am still waiting to hear from Ann Murray (at LeBoeuf Lamb) about the results of the "410(b) test" for the GSP pension plan. (If the plan cannot pass that test, it cannot be maintained in the Enron controlled group as drafted.) I called Ann again yesterday, and she is out of town until Tuesday, although she left a message that the actuary should have the results of the test when she gets back. I am holding up the letter to Media General and the notice to the trustee until I hear from Ann that all is ok. If the test is not passed, there are several alternatives, but I do not want to direct the trustee to send the assets to the GSP plan until we are sure that it is the plan that will receive the Media General assets. I will let you know as soon as I get word from Ann. Let me know if you have any questions in the meantime. Dusty Burke. Miriam M. (Dusty) Burke Vinson & Elkins L.L.P.
