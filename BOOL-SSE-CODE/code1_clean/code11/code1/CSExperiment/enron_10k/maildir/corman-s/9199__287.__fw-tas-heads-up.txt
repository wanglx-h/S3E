Raetta and Larry, is there anything special we can do now to make January's re-bill easier? Thanks.

This will entail some special invoice processing. We expect to file revised Reservation, TI Commodity and Carlton surcharge rates to be effective November 1, 2001. However, the filing probably won't be made before November 1 and we aren't likely to have approval until the end of the year. That means that November will be billed at the existing winter rates and we will need to do a 1-month refund in January to rebill November at the new rates. We hope to have approval in time to bill both Reservation & Commodity correctly for December. But, on the Reservation invoice, we may need to do a late "preliminary" run to pick up new rates, depending on when we receive an order from FERC.
