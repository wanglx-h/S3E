Subject: RE: Changes to our Infinity Contract
Michelle, What would you suggest? To jog your memory, Infinity is the outsourcing group Freight Markets is using in Chicago?not for recruiting at all. Should we just add a PWD (or whatever they're called) reflecting the different rate for the Director? Thanks!

We have added a supervisor at a different rate per month and I think the contract should reflect that. Thanks Dan Burke
