Subject: RE: 10000 mmbtu Deal at CEC/TRKL
FYI - I rebooked the deal so that you are selling directly to Direct Energy, and I let confirms know about it. I talked to Canada and they would like for you to write an annuity to them for the difference in price that you were selling to them and the price that they were selling to Direct Energy. I told them that I would talk to you on Monday and get back to them.
