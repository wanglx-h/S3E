Subject: Green power price curve
Sorry Dick, I did not manage to get back to you today. Let's talk about this Monday. Due to the limitation of the current database front end design, we will need to squeeze the green power curve into one of the existing uplift component. We can break it out but probably not on the first release. Thanks Ress
