Subject: RE: GSA Region 1 Projects Transition
No acceptance. This is not enough info for me to accept anything. We have a process which you will need to follow. I suggest you talk to Sean Holmes and ultimately EWS' structuring group will have to get comfortable with all/any of the issues before I accept. I expect better documentation than just an e-mail. Richard what are the issues - this is the first thing I have EVER heard about this? Rogers -----Original Message----- From: Wheeler, Christopher Sent: Tuesday, October 02, 2001 9:55 PM To: Herndon, Rogers; Ring, Richard Cc: Longbottom, Eric; Nanof, John Subject: GSA Region 1 Projects Transition Rogers & Richard, We are in the process of selling (transitioning) the Projects piece of the GSA Region 1 Deal to Enron Facility Services, with the commodity piece to remain the responsibility of EES. We would like to confirm that when EFS completes a project, the resulting reduced consumption figures will not adversely affect your commodity risk position. Please indicate your acceptance of this transaction by responding to this email. Regards, Chris Wheeler
