Hi. Hope your week is going well. I'm discouraged to still be sick (asthma or bronchitis or the like). Also, I'm sure that you have heard the perils of Enron. Then there is adoption stuff and then there is world news. I am really hoping that you will have some time to be my therapist this weekend. What would you think about tryin to coordinate hair appointments Sat? My only constraint is Chad's noon soccer game. If hair doesn't work then how about coffee? -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net)
