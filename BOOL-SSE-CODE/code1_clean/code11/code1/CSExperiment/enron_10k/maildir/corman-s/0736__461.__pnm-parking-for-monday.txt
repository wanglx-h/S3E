Subject: PNM parking for Monday
We have parking with PNM for off-peak on Monday. The energy schedule is as follows. The energy is at 4C but you should be able to move it to PV with PNM if you ask nicely. We will split the upside over $35 with ST SW via annuity. Please make all transmission purchases or other sales under their book. Deal number on the buy from PNM is #581199. The shape of this length is: HE1 50 HE2 50 HE3 50 HE4 50 HE5 45 HE6 20 HE23 35 HE24 50 Day total is 350. Thanks Bill
