Subject: Citizens - We have a signed agreement.
I received a call from Sarabeth Smith stating that as of 3:00 PM today (July 31) we have a signed agreement with Citizens. The plant is not expected to come back on line until Thursday or Friday per Darrell. Amy is coordinating a conference call with Craig Lipke to transition the transaction management to TW. Darrell will notify Gas Control that we are taking over the monitoring of alarms and set point (flow/pressure) control. I will coordinate the labor distribution for both Gas Control and Customer Service. Collectively between the two groups we will be charging out $8,300 per month. I want to express my thanks to Darrell, Dale, Terry, John and Amy for helping to put this deal together. ( And of course the field personnel!) Donna
