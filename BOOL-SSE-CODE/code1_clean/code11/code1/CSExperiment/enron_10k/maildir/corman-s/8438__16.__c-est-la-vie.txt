Subject: C'est la vie!
If you guys have been keeping up, you know Enron Europe is waving the white flag and shutting down. Our email addresses (and our jobs!) are being deactivated as of midday tomorrow, so you can reach us at: klande2@yahoo.com monstikalande@yahoo.com Telephone 011 44 207 376 8769 We obviously don't have an elaborate backup plan yet, as we were too busy working for the "The World's Leading Company". So we can't say where we will eventually end up, but please keep in touch and let us know how you all are doing. We miss working with all of you guys. If there is an email list for Portland put together, someone send it our way. Hang in there! Monica and Kristian Please forward this to anyone we might have missed.
