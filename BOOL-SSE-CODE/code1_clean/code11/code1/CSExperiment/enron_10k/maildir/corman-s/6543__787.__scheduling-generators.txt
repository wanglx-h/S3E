Subject: Scheduling Generators
Just a few notes on scheduling: The new VESTAL_6_WDFIRE unit's counterparty name is SierraPower. This was being scheduled as Vestal but the counterparty name has been changed. Also, there have been a few errors in scheduling the Wheelabrator units. They should be scheduled as follows: Wheelabrat: MARTEL_2_AMFOR WheelSHAST: WSENGY_1_UNIT 4 Thanks and let me know if you have any questions, Kourtney
