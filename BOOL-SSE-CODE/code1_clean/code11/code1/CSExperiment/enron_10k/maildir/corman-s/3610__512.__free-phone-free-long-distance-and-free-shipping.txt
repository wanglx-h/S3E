[IMAGE] Your inspirational quote for the day: [IMAGE] May Angels Keep You [IMAGE] May the angels light your morning, And guide you through the night, May they comfort all your sorrows, May they help you win the fight. May they keep watch over your soul, And show you better ways, May they guard you while you're sleeping, And see you through your days. May they calm your every fear, And hear you when you shout, May they show you bright new hopes, And still your every doubt.
