I am in mediation. I left a voicemail for Sharon Butcher, as well, just to make sure it is handled. My schedule shows an afternoon session. Do we have 2 sessions today? If so, you may want to split and cover. Thanks a ton. I will take you next one in August. Thanks, Kriste Kriste K. Sullivan Enron Corp. - Legal EB 4861 (713) 853-7557 Phone (713) 646-5847 Fax
