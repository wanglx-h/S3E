Subject: TransCanada
Dear Real-Timers, Just wanted to let you know that I have had 4 or 5 dispute requests which are actually a counterparty change. They have been entered in EnPower as sales or purchases to/from TransCanada Power Corp. when the counterparty is actually TransCanada Power, a division of TransCanada Energy Ltd (who really knows the difference?) Anyway, just wanted to bring this to your attention so that the next time they call, you know how to record it in EnPower. (Or at least you'll know to ask which TransCanada they are.) VA
