Since we all have access to the O Drive, I would prefer to store all of our info there. I have created a new folder called Shared in which we can store our Competitive Analysis and other files. Howe does that sound?

Together with the internal competitive analysis web site we are developing, we can use this to keep files we all need access to. Check it out - O:\StateGovAffairs\Renewables Let me know if you have any problems accessing this. Jenny
