Subject: Clarification Letter
Mark, Can you re-clarify the policy for using the 3-4 character acronyms again. There are assumptions being made that tags will be denied, starting Oct. 1, if you don't use the new 3-4 character POR/POD list even if its prior to the implementation of spec 1.7. References are being made to your clarification e-mail. But I don't read anything that states tags will be denied. Thanks, Diana Scholtes Enron (503) 464-3807
