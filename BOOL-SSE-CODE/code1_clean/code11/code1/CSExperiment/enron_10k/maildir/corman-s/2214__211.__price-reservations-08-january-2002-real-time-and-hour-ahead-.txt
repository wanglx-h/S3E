Prices in the January 8, 2002 Real-Time Market are correct. Prices in the January 9, 2002 Day-Ahead Market are correct. Please note that Market Monitoring will no longer be reserving prices due to ECA-B. Code modifications were made on December 20th to automate the ECA-B price replacements. Current real-time prices reflect any necessary changes due to ECA-B.
