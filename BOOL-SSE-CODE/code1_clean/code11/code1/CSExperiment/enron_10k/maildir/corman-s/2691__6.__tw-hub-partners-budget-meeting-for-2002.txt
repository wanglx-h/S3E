Subject: TW Hub Partners Budget Meeting for 2002
A phone conference was held to day 12/11/2001 between all the Hub partners concerning the 2002 operating budget. This meeting included TW, NWPL and PNM. All parties verbally agreed to the budget for 2002, if you all remember it was agreed to in 2000 to have a flat rate budget through 2003 with a 3.5% increase each year. John Buchanan
