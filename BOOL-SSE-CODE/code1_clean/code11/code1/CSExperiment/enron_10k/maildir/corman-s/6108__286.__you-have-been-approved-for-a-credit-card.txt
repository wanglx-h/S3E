Quick Inspirations [IMAGE] Home [IMAGE] [IMAGE] [IMAGE] [IMAGE] [IMAGE] [IMAGE] [IMAGE] [IMAGE] Your inspirational quote for the day: [IMAGE] Angels Of Wisdom [IMAGE] You have been sent the Angels of Wisdom! Follow their words of wisdom and you will be blessed! Don't be so busy adding up your troubles that you forget to count your blessings. [IMAGE] The smallest deed done is greater than the best of intentions. Love is a language that can be heard by the deaf and seen by the blind. [IMAGE] A house is made of wooden beams. A home is made of love and dreams. To be a good friend open your ears and heart more often than your mouth. [IMAGE] People don't care how much you know until they know how much you care.
