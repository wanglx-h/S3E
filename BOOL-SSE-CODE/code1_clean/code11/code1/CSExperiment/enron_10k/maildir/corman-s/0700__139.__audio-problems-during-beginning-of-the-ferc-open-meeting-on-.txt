Subject: Audio problems during beginning of the FERC Open Meeting on 2/13/02
During the first few minutes of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Open Meeting today (2/13/02) there was an audio problem at the FERC that was beyond our control. We will rebroadcast the first 15 minutes of the FERC Open meeting immediately after the meeting ends on our cable, internet and phone systems. If you have any questions, please contact our office at capcon@gmu.edu or 703-993-3100. Thank you,
