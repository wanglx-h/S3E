Subject: Peoples/Teco
Shelley, There were no penalty invoices issued to Peoples/Teco for the month of January. The only item that has occurred recently (which really doesn't appear to have been a problem) Their Jan. reservation invoice was revised and billed with a due date of 2/20 (this is an automatic defualt in TSS & must be overriden). Thus, they delayed payment until Cynthia followed up when they didn't pay timely. Otherwise, Cynthia indicates she hasn't had anything significant occur. Sheila
