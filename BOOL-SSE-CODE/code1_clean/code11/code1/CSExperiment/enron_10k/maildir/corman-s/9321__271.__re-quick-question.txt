Subject: quick question I worked with someone on a project that APQC did for us, and he is now looking for a new opportunity (just our of law school). I let him know that Enron doesn't typically hire right out of law school, but was wondering if there might be someone he could talk to about "a day in the life of a corporate lawyer." Is there someone in particular who handles recruiting for legal? Thanks for your help! Missy
