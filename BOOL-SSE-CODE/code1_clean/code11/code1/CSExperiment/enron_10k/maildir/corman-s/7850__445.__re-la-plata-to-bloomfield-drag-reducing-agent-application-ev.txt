 Evaluation - No Go
Thanks to all for helping to evaluate and come to an agreement on this project. Maybe sometime later we'll get another chance to look at it .

Tracy indicated that if the launchers and receivers were installed as a part of the pipeline integrity program, the incremental cost of DRA application may then be economically beneficial. Thanks to everyone who contributed to this effort. John
