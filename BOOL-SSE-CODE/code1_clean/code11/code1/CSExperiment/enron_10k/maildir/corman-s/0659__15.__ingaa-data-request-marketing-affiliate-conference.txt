Subject: INGAA Data Request - Marketing Affiliate Conference
Based on the criteria established in Shelley's initial email request and the additional information gathered from our meeting yesterday afternoon, here is the data I have compiled for Transwestern using an effective date of November 1, 2000. I am still in the process of verifying one shipper's agency services and will notify you if there are any corrections to be made to this document no later than COB today. If you have any questions regarding the spreadsheets, please feel free to contact me at x3-6928. I will be on vacation until next Wednesday, 12/27 but staying in town. If any issues arise during my absence, please contact Linda Trevino or page me at (800) 718-0830. Thanks, Elizabeth
