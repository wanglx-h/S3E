Subject: UCU Chart Changing
According to members of the Beatrice management team the timeliness of chart changing activities in the Beatrice Region is not an issue. Is this truly the case? If not, please provide me a list of facilities in the Beatrice Region where this is an issue. Thanks, David L. Gaines
