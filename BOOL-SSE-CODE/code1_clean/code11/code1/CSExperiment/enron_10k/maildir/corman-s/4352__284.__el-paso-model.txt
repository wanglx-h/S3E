Subject: El Paso Model
Group, For the third day in a row (4th time this week) I have received an email or call from Kathy at EPE asking the model to be resent because of simple errors. Typos in the model should be caught and corrected while checking out with counterparties and running the CARP. The ancillary service (spin) deals need to sum into the ancillary section at the bottom...not with the regular deal entry summary. We need to use the reconciliation sheet when appropriate (which has not been used since Feb--and this will haunt us when Houston tries to check out March and April). We do a good job trading for EPE and managing their system but I am not impressed with our attention to detail for this customer on deal entry. I continue to see the same mistakes which suggests that procedure questions exist. Please ask myself or a senior member of the group if you have any questions. I look for us to improve going forward. Thanks, Bill 503-887-3449
