Richard, attached are the most recent labels for Massachusetts. If you could review when you get a chance -- I will be in on Wednesday, January 2 and Thursday, January 3 in the afternoon, maybe we can discuss changes at that time, unless we are no longer doing business in this state?? Thanks for your help. Christy
