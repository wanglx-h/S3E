I'm concerned about the magnitude of the supply imbalance that we've built up again. Tim - are these numbers verified and up to date. Can I get a breakdown of the 1.5 Bcf and the 700 MMcf current month portion. It seems like we just worked down these balances in the fall and now we're building these balances back up again. If these supply imbalances are building up as a result of Phase V outages perhaps the payback gas use should be separately captured and recorded against the project. -----Original Message----- From: Howard, Jack Sent: Thursday, January 17, 2002 7:22 AM To: Boatman, Jack; Cady, Rachel; Corman, Shelley; Craig, Rick; Dowden Jr., Jimmy; Farrell, Sharon; Hayes, Robert; Long, John; Nacey, Sheila; Nelson, Beverley; Nestor II, Thomas; Shelly Corman; Swanson, Dan Subject: morn meet 1/17/02 << File: MORNMEET.XLS >>
