I actually did get that last e-mail, but somehow it ended up buried at the bottom of my in-box, just like so many other things. As far as the Blazer ticket trade, I believe I bought a call from you on the Laker game, and you bought the option from me on the Cavaliers - so I can choose to exercise on 12/13 at 7 p.m., and you can choose to exercise on 1/16 at 7 p.m. In other words, no matter what happens, I'm going to both games. Got it? As far as good stories from that night, I probably have the best, or at least one of the more hilarious, of those circulating the floor. And no, it has nothing to do with me. Ask me about it later, and I might be able to give it up for firm delivery of a seat at next week's game. Think about it. Kate
