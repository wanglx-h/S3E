What's up?!? I'm so curious to hear about all your crazy adventures in Vegas this weekend! Did your sister go with you guys? Thanks for the message the other night, morning, whenever it was, that was really sweet. (Not sure if you remember leaving it or not.) Regardless, I miss you too. We have to get together soon. Did I tell you that I'm going to Vegas in April? I'm excited! I had a thought... I was thinking that a real man, such as yourself deserves and needs a much bigger tv then what you have. I mean, really. I think that you should sell the tv back to me for $100 (or free if you're feeling generous :) and buy yourself a much bigger, more manly, 26 or 32 inch tv. What do you think?
