Subject: RE: interconnects
Ranelle, I have a meeting Tuesday afternoon from 2:30 - 3;30 and Wednesday from 1:00 - 2:00. Otherwise I am available on those two afternoons. I would like for John Buchanan and Terry Kowalke to be included on this discussion. Thanks for getting this meeting set up.

Tuesday is probably better since we'll need to get the fuel filing out on Monday pm. sjk -----Original Message----- From: Paladino, Ranelle Sent: Friday, July 06, 2001 4:47 PM To: Kirk, Steve; Dornan, Dari; January, Steven; Blair, Lynn; Williams, Jo Subject: interconnects We would like to have a meeting to discuss how we should/want to handle scheduling alternates versus TI above our sustainable capacity level at interconnect points. I don't know what everyone's schedule looks like so I will throw out Tuesday (July 10th) or Wednesday (July 11th) in the afternoon as options. We will probably need at least an hour. What times are best? Is there anyone else I need to include? Ranelle
