Subject: Fetzer Vineyards and renewable power
Richard and Lamar: Fetzer e-mailed me recently and wants to begin discussions on extending their fixed price renewable power deal with us. Their current fixed price expires in 5/02 with and index price going out to 2009. If this is below your radar, Lamar I would be happy to work it with the customer and Richard on the renewable energy side. Aaron Klemm Service Management 714-429-8125 714-434-7075
