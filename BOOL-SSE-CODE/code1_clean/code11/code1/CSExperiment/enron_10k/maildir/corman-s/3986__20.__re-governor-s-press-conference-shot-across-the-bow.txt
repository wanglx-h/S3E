Subject: Re: Governor's Press Conference -- Shot Across the Bow
There appears to be a pattern forming. The administration seems to make a scene just prior to large events (e.g., Davis' letters calling for wholesale caps just prior to the ISO Board vote, and now this on the eve of the joint Assembly/Senate hearing scheduled for today). In other late-breaking news. On the heels of this press conference, I received late last evening from Loretta Lynch's chief of staff a copy of a proposed decision Lynch will release today reversing last Thursday's decision rejecting (0-5) retail price caps in San Diego. The draft decision she proposes would establish an "interim" retail rate cap only for SDG&E residential and small commercial customers. She proposes to use a "balancing account" to finance the cap. Though it looks like the "interim" cap would extend through December 2003, there is one place in the decision that states the cap should only extend through December 2000.

He called on FERC to expedite their investigation of the market and to provide for consumer rebates if FERC cannot conclude that California prices are "just and reasonable." Below are my notes from the press conference. Attached is the Governor's press release. Karen Edson Notes from Gov. Davis, Press Conference: Opening Statement Record hot temperatures; lack of supply; price manipulation have created the crisis. Electricity is the life blood of the State's economy. He (the Governor) has responded with several recent steps. Among them is his request that the AG & FERC examine price manipulation 1st Point He is calling on the CPUC to establish a price stability rate for consumers and business. His intent is to reduce rates to $55-$65/mo. for next year or two. (This point was unclear. Did he mean rates, bills, or what?) Customers need predictable, reliable, affordable rates 2nd Point The Governor called on President Clinton and Chairman Hoecker to expedite an investigation of the unconscionable rates being charged by out-of-state generators to California utilities The Governor wants FERC to make evidentiary findings that rates are just and reasonable. If FERC can,t make such findings, he wants them to require consumer rebates. (This portion of his comments is not reflected in the attached press release. It is taken right from the script of Senator Steve Peace.) 3rd Point Believes deregulation will work. Generators must be held responsible. When gouging and extorting; you must pay the price.
