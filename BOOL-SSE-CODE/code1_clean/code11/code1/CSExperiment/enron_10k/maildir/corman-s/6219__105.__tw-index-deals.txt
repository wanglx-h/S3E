Subject: TW Index Deals
It looks to me from reviewing the bid documents we received on the January I to I deals like we communicated to the counterparties identical information that the capacity would be available in several "packages" and other details of the sale procedure. That communication must have been either (1) a posting of some type, (2) a fax or other document we sent them explaining what space was available and how to bid, or (3) a script that the marketers were all following to communicate to the customers. Toby, if it was a posting, it would have gone up in late December or the first few days of January. Please verify whether we did any open season posting advertising that space (which included Dec. 01 space and calendar '02 and '03 space). If it was a fax or other document or a script, we need to get our hands on it. Kevin, Lorraine, TK, Susan--does anyone remember which it was or know how to get our hands on it? If we are going to be in a dogfight with BP on these deals, lets make sure we go in armed with as much of the relevant information as possible to demonstrate we were following the rules. DF
