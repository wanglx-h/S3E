Subject: FW: IMBALANCE REPORT FOR NNG
Steve, I am going to let you answer this one. Thanks. Lynn -----Original Message----- From: Hall, Margaret Sent: Tuesday, October 02, 2001 8:34 AM To: Blair, Lynn; January, Steven; Hall, Margaret Subject: IMBALANCE REPORT FOR NNG Lynn and Steve, How hard would it be for someone in the logistics group to develop and distribute weekly a report on all of the NNG interconnects and the imbalances of all of the ones that we receive a report of the noms from scheduling. I am talking about a report like TW gets from Richard Hanagriff that gives all of the imbalances. This would help Gas Control to keep a better idea of where we are with the other companies. I have had other gas controllers ask me this same question. Thank you both for your time and trouble in looking into this for us. Sincerely, Margaret Hall
