Dynegy I have recommended this before and continue to believe that it should (and could successfully) be pursued. Could someone forward the Hendricks pleading? On instruction from Richard, I would be happy to start the lobbying campaign at FERC (and possibly the SG's office as well) to secure such a supportive pleading. >>> <Mary.Hain@enron.com> 02/22/01 05:54PM >>> Today, I worked with Robin Gibbs and Jeff Alexander on an Enron pleading in the captioned case. I asked if we had considered asking FERC Staff to file a "friend of the court" brief detailing how FERC has "occupied the field" of wholesale rate regulation. Was this or should this be considered?
