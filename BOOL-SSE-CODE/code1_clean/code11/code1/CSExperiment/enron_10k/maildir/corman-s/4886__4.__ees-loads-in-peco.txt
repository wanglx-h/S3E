Jackie Thank you for your call and I look forward to getting the list of account transfer dates you promised to send me. Please remember that while we need to have meter-read dates for all customers, we must have information on the three hourly metered accounts by early tomorrow morning (Friday) in order to send an appropriate schedule to Connie. I will investigate your question about the remaining four accounts and advise you of any appropriate actions. Thanks again. Michael Michael R.
