Yes - please reschedule for Tues. Thanks -----Original Message----- From: Winters, Ricki Sent: Wednesday, January 16, 2002 11:38 AM To: Corman, Shelley Subject: Holiday & Staff Mtg. Shelley would you like for me to send out a message moving your staff meeting this Monday (1/21) because it's a holiday to 11:00 on Tuesday (1/22). It's moved on your calendar and the conference room has been booked since we moved to 42. Thanks, Ricki
