Subject: RE: ENRON/Clonch release
This looks fine -- have we released us from any and all obligations that may have arisen before the date the agreement is signed? I don't want there to be any other surprises, so I'd like to include "known and unknown" type language here. Also, does the definition of ECT include all parents, shareholders, affiliates, employees, attorneys, etc? Let's be very clear. I'd also like a covenant not to sue signed by both Clonch and his attorneys. -----Original Message----- From: phaynes1@spilmanlaw.com@ENRON Sent: Tuesday, November 06, 2001 11:17 AM To: Cash, Michelle Subject: ENRON/Clonch release Ms. Cash, the attached is a draft release prepared by Mr. Woody.
