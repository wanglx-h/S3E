Thanks for your kind words. -----Original Message----- From: Forbish, Sherry Sent: Friday, December 07, 2001 10:26 AM To: Corman, Shelley Subject: Your upcoming trip Godspeed to you and your family as you make this trip. My younger child is adopted and it has been a wonderful blessing and experience -- he is about to celebrate his 27th birthday! These are difficult days -- all of us may not understand everything that is taking place but we remain committed to diligently performing our jobs. Have a safe trip!
