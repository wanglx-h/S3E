Subject: Cuts at NOB
Group, Yesterday 11 /11 and this morning 11/12 the ISO cut one of our schedules where Enron was exporting from SP 15, to NOb more specifically the schedule looks like this: CISO-EPMI-SCL. Per Sean Crandall starting tomorrow and forward we will not allow the ISO to cut our schedules UNTIL all the OTHER nonfirm schedules are cut FIRST. This is made possible by new FTRs that Chris Mallory scheduled on the Sp/NOB path. As a result of having firm transmission rights If the ISO calls and cuts one of our schedules at NOB we need to make sure and ask the ISO that the other nonfirm schedules are cut first then we can accept our cut. For any further questions on this matter contact Sean Crandall or Chris MAllory thanks Monika
