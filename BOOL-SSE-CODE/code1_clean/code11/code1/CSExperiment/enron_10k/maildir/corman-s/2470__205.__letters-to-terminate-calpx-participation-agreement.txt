Subject: Letters to terminate CalPX Participation Agreement
Christian asked me to work with Dan Watkiss to prepare a FERC filing to terminate EPMI's participation in the PX. I have asked Dan to get started as Christian said we may decide to file as soon as today. See attached explanation. Does EES also have a participation agreement? And if so do we also need to file a termination for EES? ---------------------- Forwarded by Mary Hain/HOU/ECT on 02/01/2001 09:04 AM --------------------------- Christian Yoder 02/01/2001 08:12 AM To: Mary Hain/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Letters to terminate EPMI's CalPX Participation Agreement ---------------------- Forwarded by Christian Yoder/HOU/ECT on 02/01/2001 07:53 AM --------------------------- Christian Yoder 02/01/2001 07:47 AM To: DWatkiss@bracepatt.com cc: Elizabeth Sager/HOU/ECT@ECT, Richard B Sanders/HOU/ECT@ECT, gfergus@brobeck.com, jklauber@llgm.com, Steve C Hall/PDX/ECT@ECT Subject: Letters to terminate EPMI's CalPX Participation Agreement Dan, At some point in the incremental meltdown of the PX process, perhaps when we default on payment of the large chargeback bill we will receive today or tomorrow and the PX takes our remaining collateral, the question will suddenly be: how does one make sure one is not the last man standing? It would seem that if it is possible to ever become a "former" participant in the PX and not a "current" one, ("current" being the word used in the tariff to describe who the chargebacks go to) that we would have had, at a minimum, to have given notice of termination of our participation in both the Core and CTS markets. Please review this documentation and help us prepare for a possible extradited extraction from the PX. Thanks.----cgy ---------------------- Forwarded by Christian Yoder/HOU/ECT on 02/01/2001 07:19 AM --------------------------- Steve C Hall 01/31/2001 05:57 PM To: Elizabeth Sager/HOU/ECT@ECT, Richard B Sanders/HOU/ECT@ECT, gfergus@brobeck.com, Christian Yoder/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Letters to terminate EPMI's CalPX Participation Agreement I have attached ready-to-file drafts of the letters necessary to terminate EPMI's Participation Agreement with the CalPX. In addition to the letter to the CalPX, I am reasonably certain that a FERC filing is required to terminate the Participation Agreement because it is a power purchase/sale agreement, the form of which is on file with FERC. Just to be safe I prepared the transmittal letter, notice of termination, and notice of filing necessary to file with FERC. Among other things, I requested waiver of the 60-day notice period. I'll wait for further instruction before doing anything else on this matter. Steve
