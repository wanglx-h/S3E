Subject: Mainline Expansion Scenarios
Attached are 250 and 300 MMcf/d cases to expand TW's mainline, Topock, and San Juan lateral. These are + 30% costs but still based on the latest E&C estimate for Sun Devil. If San Juan lateral is not expanded, then facility modifications and costs must be included for supplies to come from the east end which is not included in this study. Keep in mind the cases including pipe loop used the smallest diameter pipe possible. Therefore those cases can't be expanded above the 250/300 MMcf/d level easily. If you have any questions, please call.
