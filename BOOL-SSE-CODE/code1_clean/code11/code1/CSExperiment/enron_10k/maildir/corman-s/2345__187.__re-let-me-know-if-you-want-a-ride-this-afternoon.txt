Meet you downstairs at 5:50 -- that way we'll hit the HOV at "2" person time. -----Original Message----- From: Adams, Laurel Sent: Tuesday, September 25, 2001 5:16 PM To: Corman, Shelley Subject: RE: Let me know if you want a ride this afternoon That would be great. How about around 5:45--6pm? Not sure when you were thinking of leaving. I've got plenty to keep me busy 'til 6. -----Original Message----- From: Corman, Shelley Sent: Tuesday, September 25, 2001 5:00 PM To: Callans, Nancy; Adams, Laurel Subject: Let me know if you want a ride this afternoon I'm flexible on the departure time
