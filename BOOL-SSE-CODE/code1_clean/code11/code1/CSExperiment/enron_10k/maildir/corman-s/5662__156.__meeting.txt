Greg, I am a new Associate from Georgetown and I am very excited to be part of Enron. I hope to earn great success in the future and will work tremendously hard to show my very best here. I would enjoy an opportunity to sit down for lunch with you to hear your perspective on the company and success factors. I think you would be an excellent person to talk to for two reasons: 1) Your success in the Associate Program and extensive multi-divisional experience within the company. 2) Your advanced knowledge of drivers and opportunities within the energy industry. Regards, Jason Jennaro
