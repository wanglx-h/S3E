Subject: Follow-Up on OFCCP Meeting
Michelle and Steve, Have we received the letter from the OFCCP regarding the closing of the Corporate Management Review? This is the letter we are expecting as a result of your meeting in Washington, D.C. with the OFCCP about 6-7 weeks ago. Should I contact Rosalee Fleming since the letter could have gone to Ken Lay? Can you please let me know? Thanks so much. Regards, Sandra
