Subject: RE: Wire and Check Request Changes
We just want to reinterate that we will not be paying anyone until our Commodity due date. For instance, if the invoices that you sent out at Commodity time add up to a credit, we will not pay them until the due date that we have on those invoices and so for this month, since our due date is a day that is an Enron Holiday (December 24), we will not be paying anyone until December 26. I know that in the past we may have paid the shippers early but our policy has always really been to not pay them until the due date. We will want to do this from now on unless your have a special circumstance. If you have any questions, please let us know.

We will have a drop box in my office for these and they will need to get down to him 2 days before you want the wire or check to go out. If you have any questions, please let me know. Thanks, Raetta
