Subject: RE: ANNUAL ANTITRUST PROGRAM
Ava, what is the status of setting up the follow up meeting for those that did not attend? Frazier King can tell you when they will have the tape. Let's be sure to set this up by the end of June if possible. Thanks.

I have talked with Frazier and here is our game plan for the teams. If you can attend one of the sessions below, please make every effort to attend. If you cannot attend, then let Ava know and she will keep track of names for me. After the PRC process we will set up a video for you to watch. It is very critical we all attend the meeting or see the video. Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks. Lynn -- From Drew Fossum The Enron Transportation Services Legal Department will present the Annual Antitrust Program in Houston on: May 8 EB5C2 2:00-3:00 p.m. May 17 EB49C2 3:00-4:00 p.m. May 22 EB5C2 2:00-3:00 p.m. Refreshments will be served. It is ETS's policy that all marketing and business development personnel attend this seminar each year. The purpose of this program is to provide a refresher on basic antitrust laws and "Do's and don'ts" for conducting business. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU ATTEMPT TO ARRANGE YOUR SCHEDULE TO ATTEND. PLEASE MAKE SURE TO SIGN IN WHEN YOU ATTEND. The May 17 session will be transmitted to the video conference rooms in both Maitland and Omaha.
