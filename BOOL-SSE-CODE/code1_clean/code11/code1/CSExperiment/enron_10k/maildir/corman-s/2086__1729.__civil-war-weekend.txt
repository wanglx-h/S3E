Subject: Civil War Weekend
Hello there fellow Fraters: I 'm just wishing you all the best on this weekends Civil War. I hope to see and speak with as many of you as possible this weekend whether at the game or at good old Clodfelters. As for the Alumni donation, I guess we are almost there. If you haven't given but have been considering it, let Dustin or I (Rich T771) know. If you haven't considered it yet, then maybe you could start? Thank you for your time and Go Beavs. Rich Roskopf ffitness@uswest.net
