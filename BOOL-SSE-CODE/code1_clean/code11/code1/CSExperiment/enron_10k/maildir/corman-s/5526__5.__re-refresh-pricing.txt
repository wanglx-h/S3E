Natsource can get us done at $5.00 Do you remember what the total volumes are for this deal? -----Original Message----- From: Quigley, Kay Sent: Monday, October 29, 2001 9:23 AM To: Ring, Richard; Mainzer, Elliot Subject: Refresh pricing Kinko's wants their pricing refreshed for their Reliant and TXU sites only. I need to know the fixed $MWh price if we assume a 50% renewable product in TXU and a 100% renewable product in Reliant's service area. I am trying to fill out the attached template that Larry sent to me with my gen only price refreshed, some Price to beat estimates I ran for him and your new renewable power quotes.
