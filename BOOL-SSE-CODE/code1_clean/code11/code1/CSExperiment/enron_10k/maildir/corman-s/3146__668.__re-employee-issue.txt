Subject: Re: Employee Issue
Drew, thanks, I got it. I'll be sending out an email on this in the next couple of hours. I'll send it to you and Robert first. You can run it by Chapman and/or outside counsel in London today. If everyone is in agreement as to the approach, we can send it to Louise asap. More to come . . . .

DCL Michelle Cash 19/10/2000 01:45 To: Drew C Lynch/LON/ECT@ECT cc: Robert Jones/Corp/Enron@ENRON Subject: Employee Issue Drew, Louise and Robert have brought me into the loop on the employee in London who has had some issues. I would appreciate it if you would fax me a copy of his agreement. I will be out of the office tomorrow, so, if possible, could you fax it to my house first thing in the morning? 713-218-7355 is the fax number. If you send it around 5:30 am Houston time, then I can have time to review it and incorporate its provisions into the draft correspondence that I will prepare on this topic. I am going to be attending a seminar out of the office starting around 8:00 am Houston time. I will prepare draft correspondence and circulate it to you, Robert, and Louise for comment and dart-throwing. I can be reached via my cell phone during the day at 713-302-5522. Thanks, Drew. Michelle
