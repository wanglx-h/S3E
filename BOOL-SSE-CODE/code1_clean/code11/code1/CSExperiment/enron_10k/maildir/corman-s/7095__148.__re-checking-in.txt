Yes Thank You - The Home Study arrived yesterday in the mail and I'm shipping it off to the INS today. I just go back in town last night from a business trip and am anxious to Liz today. -----Original Message----- From: tina whiteman [mailto:twhiteman@austin.rr.com] Sent: Thursday, October 04, 2001 2:03 PM To: Corman, Shelley Subject: Checking In Shelley, Did you get the home study yet? It should have arrived by now. Also were you able to email Liz? I am still looking for her phone number. I will email it if I find it. Suzanne
