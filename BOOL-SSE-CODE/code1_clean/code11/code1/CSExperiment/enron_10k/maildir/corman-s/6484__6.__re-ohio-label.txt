Subject: RE: Ohio Label
Richard et al: I'm not sure what needs to be done - Nicole says we're doing a physical product in CG&E. I will forward her message to me to all of you. Richard & Stacy - please work together to figure out what needs to be done, if anything to the fuel mix part. Thanks.

It should either be the utilities that provide disclosure label information for our label we have to default to "Unknown Purchases" or whatever else is allowed/required by the Ohio PUC's.

I've had Sandy Cofer look over this one that was done by Allison way back when to see if it still meets requirements, and it does. Can you confirm the fuel mixes, etc. for me? Thanks.
