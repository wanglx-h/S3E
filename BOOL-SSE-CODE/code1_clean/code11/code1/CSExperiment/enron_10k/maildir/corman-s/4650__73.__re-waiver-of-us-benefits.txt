So my line to Louise and Mark is? -----Original Message----- From: Callahan, Timothy Sent: Monday, October 22, 2001 12:04 PM To: Oxley, David Cc: Cash, Michelle; Fox, Madeline Subject: RE: Waiver of US Benefits I'll get duplicate copies to you for signature. The reason for doing this is more the former than the latter mentioned below. However, there is a concern that other UK nationals remaining on the UK payroll could try to use the US non-discrimination rules to obtain US benefits, if you were provided both. Their success in such a challenge is questionable.

Explain to me again why we have to do this? Is it purely to confirm we don't get stuff twice or is there a concern that our participation in both causes a sub-space paradox which may create a time vacuum into which the entire world population may be sucked?
