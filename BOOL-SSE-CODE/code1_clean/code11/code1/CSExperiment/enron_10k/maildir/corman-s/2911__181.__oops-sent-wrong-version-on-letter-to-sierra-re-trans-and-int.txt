Subject: OOPs - sent wrong version on Letter to Sierra re trans and interX
 for Project Priscilla
Here's the right version. I've deleted the earlier version. Sorry about any confusion.

I forwarded it to Mitch Taylor for his information and review. I'm comfortable sending the letter (assuming Mitch agrees). I want to call Steve Oldham first and warn him of the problem. I am uncomfortable taking any further formal action at least until we have a meeting with Sierra on the PGE transaction that was scheduled for this week and may take place next week. Do we have any idea on what further delay is costing us (i.e., $__/month)?

Due to Nevada Power's dilatory tactics to date and the pendancy of financing for the project, Ed, Don, Stan, Jim G., and I agree that the letter takes the necessary tone and should ask Sierra to file with FERC the agreements (unexecuted) if Sierra doesn't give EPMI an executable contracts by 2/28/01. If we are going to make this demand we need to send this letter ASAP.
