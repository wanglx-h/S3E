Angela Mendez -----Original Message----- From: Bushton-Maintenance, Team Sent: Friday, September 14, 2001 3:39 PM To: Mendez, Angela Subject: Low flows to Oneok at Bushton Angela, Please accept this as written documentation of the lower than normal flows to the Oneok extraction plant. On September 10, 2001, at 23:10 PLT, Unit #29 dropped a valve in it's #12 power cylinder causing it to be declared not available. As a result we were unable to maintain the normal flow rates to Oneok. This situation existed until September 12, 2001 at 15:35 PLT, when the unit was returned to service. If you have further questions or need more information please cantact me or Casey Winter at (620)562-4325. Greg Reece (Bushton Measurement)
