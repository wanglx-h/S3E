Subject: Program funding
Michelle, this barely intelligible email contains the draft letter from Noxtech's President, Ralph Slone. We averted this crisis by advancing Noxtech $50,000 against the expenses incurred on our behalf by Noxtech that are reimbursable under the License Agreement. I spoke with Ralph Slone today, by the way. He thinks PBCC, his lender, will have comments back on the Warrant Agreement today. I will keep you apprised. Best regards, Vince ---------------------- Forwarded by Vince Middleton/HOU/ECT on 11/27/2000 05:30 PM --------------------------- "Ralph Slone" <rslone@noxtechinc.com> on 10/15/2000 04:47:24 PM To: "Vince F. Middleton" <vince.middleton@enron.com> cc: Subject: Program funding Vince, cannot make its payroll for the end of the month (October) if it does not receive the advance to cover our expenses as described in attached letter. I have not sent the letter to Mike or George. I would prefer to resolve this problem between you and I. If I haven't received a definitive answer from you by Monday afternoon I will take that to mean no. I will then send the letter to the Cc list. Regards.? - enronfund.doc
