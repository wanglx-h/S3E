Joe, Christi, & Mary -- Do you think that it makes sense for the four of us to sit down with this report the day after it comes out and discuss (1) Enron's perspective, (2) should/are we participating, and (3) key commercial / regulatory that need the information? I am trying to make sure that everything is covered appropriately and maybe this is the right format - unless you guys can think of something else?
