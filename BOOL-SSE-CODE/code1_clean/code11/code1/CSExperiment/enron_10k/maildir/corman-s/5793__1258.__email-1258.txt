A fellow employee has been diagnosed with the measles. If you have any concerns, I would encourage you to contact your physician. The employees who are most at risk are: Women who are pregnant. Anyone who has not been immunized and has not had the measles. If you require a visit to the doctor for a vaccination or check-up as a result of potentially being exposed to the measles, Enron will reimburse you for your medical co-pay. Please submit a copy of your receipt to me for processing. If you have any questions or I can be of further assistance, please contact me. Amy
