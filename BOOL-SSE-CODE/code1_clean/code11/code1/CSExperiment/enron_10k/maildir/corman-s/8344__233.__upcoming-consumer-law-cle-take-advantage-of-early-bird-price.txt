Subject: UPCOMING CONSUMER LAW CLE: TAKE ADVANTAGE OF "EARLY BIRD" PRICES!
Oregon Law Institute, Northwestern School of Law of Lewis & Clark College is pleased to present a program on &A Primer on Consumer Law8 on Friday, May 4th at the Oregon Convention Center, in Portland. You can still take advantage of our &early bird8 price of $140 or $110 for new attorneys (admitted 2000-2001), paralegals, or secretaries. This price is good through April 30th. By now, you should know that attorneys can be considered debt collectors subject to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ) even if the attorney never sends a letter or makes a telephone call, but simply files a lawsuit. Litigation against attorneys under the FDCPA is increasing nationwide, and attorneys are being held liable for even innocent and technical violations of the FDCPA. Attend this program to learn the top 10 ways attorneys violate the FDCPA, and how they can avoid the violations. Learning even one new tip could save you in damages many times the cost of this CLE! The brochure is attached in PDF format. You may also contact the Oregon Law Institute at 503-243-3326 or 800-222-8213 for a brochure or to register now at the &early bird8 tuition. -- Oregon Law Institute Northwestern School of Law of Lewis & Clark College 620 SW Main, Suite 706 Portland, OR 97205 PH: (503) 243-3326 (800) 222-8213 FX: (503) 242-2931 E-mail: oli@lclark.edu - Consumer.pdf
