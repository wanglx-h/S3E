They are naturally long and I think I could work something out if you guys are natural buyers. The other 2 periods are: Jun-Dec02 (starting one month later than your last quote). The other period is the PJM planning year Jun02-May03. The amount could be higher if that works for you guys. Let me know if you want to do more than 100 MW and I will see what I can do." Any interest and at what level?
