Subject: FW: Clarification Letter
Diana/Cara, Attached is a letter from Mark Hackey, which I assume you have already read. Do you have any issues related to this document that I need to address with anyone on the WSCC OC or WMIC? Generally the letter seems pretty straight forward, it seems too bad that they hedge, even the Dec 11 implementation date. Please let me know if there is anything we need to address in this letter, Thanks, Dave -----Original Message----- From: Maiser@wscc.com@ENRON [mailto:IMCEANOTES-Maiser+40wscc+2Ecom+40ENRON@ENRON.com] On Behalf Of "Hackney, Mark W(Z39911)" <Mark.Hackney@aps.com> Sent: Monday, September 24, 2001 12:18 PM To: Western Market Interface Committee Subject: Clarification Letter Please read attached letter: <<Clarifying Letter.doc>> Mark W.
