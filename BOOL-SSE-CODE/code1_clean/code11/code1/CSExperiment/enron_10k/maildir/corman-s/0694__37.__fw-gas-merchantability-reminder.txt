Subject: FW: Gas Merchantability Reminder
fyi -----Original Message----- From: CustomerNotices, WGPHOU [mailto:WGPHOU.CustomerNotices@Williams.com] Sent: Wednesday, December 19, 2001 2:51 PM Subject: Gas Merchantability Reminder December 19, 2001 Notice to: All Producers, Receipt Point Operators, Interconnecting Pipelines and Shippers on the Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation (Transco) System Subject: Gas Merchantability Reminder Transco has been receiving gas with a slightly higher heating content (btu/cf) in its mainline over the past week and feels this is the result of processing plants scaling back their operations due to poor economics. Transco reminds Producers and Shippers on its system to ensure that processing arrangements are in place and that the gas received by Transco meets its merchantability requirements. These gas merchantability specifications are outlined in Transco's gas merchantability notice, most recently re-posted July 27, 2001. If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact the following at Transco: Ron Doyle, 713-215-2921 or Terry Fitch, 713-215- 3361.
