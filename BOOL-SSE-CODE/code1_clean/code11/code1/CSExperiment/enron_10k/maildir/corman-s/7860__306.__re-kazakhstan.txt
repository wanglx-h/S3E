Thanks for the information. Do you happen to have an email address for Elza? -----Original Message----- From: H.

It was obviously a professional who preys on victims every day. I assume you are going to Kazakhstan on Thursday, probaly arriving in Almaty late Friday night. I hope your flight goes direct from Frankfurt or Amsterdam direct to Almaty. It saves a little hassle if you avoid Moscow, unless you plan to do some touring before going on to Kazakhstan. I have been to Almaty two times. It is a beautiful city surrounded by snow capped mountains. If you have a vivid imagination you can see China just across the mountains. You can contact the following folks who can help you if you get stuck. Elza Utegenova spent a semester with us last year. She teaches at The Kazak State Agrarian University. She speaks excellent English and is a wonderful person. She does not have a car or telephone. She could help arrange city travel. You should make arrangements before you depart, unless you are taking a lap-top with you. You could also contact Daulet Chunkunov, country director for WINROCK INTERNATIONAL in Kazakhstan. He has been to Pennsylvania and we have visited with him on both of our trips to Almaty. He speaks good English, has a car, email, and telephones. His email is dc@winrock.lorton.com. Cell phone 8 333 210 8320. Other phone 3272 63-05-56. Fax(3272)63-15-55. I am completing this after talking with you by telephone. Good luck and keep in touch, Lou
