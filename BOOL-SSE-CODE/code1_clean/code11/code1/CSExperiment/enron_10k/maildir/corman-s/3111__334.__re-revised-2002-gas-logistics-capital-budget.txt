Subject: RE: Revised 2002 Gas Logistics Capital Budget
Caroline - I think you captured the right projects, but please look at the bottom line on total reductions. You show $3 Million in savings. I think that the schedule should reflect over $6 million of reductions from the original cap. budget. In my mind there is still a question on whether the meter bounce and PNR projects should be included. -----Original Message----- From: Barnes, Caroline Sent: Thursday, December 06, 2001 5:19 PM To: Corman, Shelley; Holmes, Bradley; January, Steve; Ratliff, Dale; Kenagy, Gary; Scott, Donna Cc: Krone, Amy; Carpenter, Nancy Subject: Revised 2002 Gas Logistics Capital Budget Please see attached.
