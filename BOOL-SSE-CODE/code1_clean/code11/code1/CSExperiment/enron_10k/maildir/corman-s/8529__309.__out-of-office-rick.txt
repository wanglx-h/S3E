Subject: Out of Office - Rick
I just got back from the eye doctor. My eye wasn't scratched. I had a rusty piece of metal in it! I tore down my garden (which is framed and covered in chicken wire to keep out the critters) on Sunday and a piece of the wire must have lodged in my eye. I will spare you the gross details of him using a needle to dig this rusty piece of metal out of my eye like a splinter... It was numb and still hurt. I won't be in this afternoon. Rick
