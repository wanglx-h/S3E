Subject: Hi
Hi Sherene, Mom forwarded a note that you were looking for Chad suggestions. He is into anything about rocks, Harry Potter, or of course his all time favorite -- baseball. I'm leaving for Kazakhstan tomorrow, so I didn't have time to ask for gift lists for your guys. Chad helped me pick out some items -- that I hope they'll like. Believe me, you will see the Chad influence when you open the items. A box is on its way to you. Have a blessed holiday. Love Shelley
