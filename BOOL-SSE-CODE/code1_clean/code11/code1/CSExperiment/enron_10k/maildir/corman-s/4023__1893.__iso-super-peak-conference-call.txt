Subject: ISO Super-Peak Conference Call
For your information, CTS (CalPX Trading Services) will be hosting a conference call on Wednesday, October 25, 2000 @ 1130 PST to discuss the recent introduction of ISO Super-Peak contracts. These contracts, which are available for daily day-of trading from 5 AM - 8 AM on weekdays, provide customers with an opportunity to sell hourly blocks of energy directly to the CAISO. Because the scheduling and settlement of these contracts takes place directly between the ISO and its counterparties, these procedures are outside the normal CTS parameters and are subject to unique requirements. This call will provide customers with details of such procedures and requirements. Date: Wednesday, October 25, 2000 Time: 11:30 PST Call in: 888-452-9851 Password: Super Peak Leader: Cleo Center We look forward to your participation on this call. If you have any questions, please contact your Client Executive.
