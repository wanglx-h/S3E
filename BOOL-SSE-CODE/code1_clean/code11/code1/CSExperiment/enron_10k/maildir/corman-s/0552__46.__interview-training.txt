Subject: Interview Training
Michelle, Tana & I will be facilitating several brown bag interview trainings next week. Please review the portion of our handout titled "Legal Guidelines." Let me know if you think we need to add or delete anything. Our goal is to cover the basic do's and don'ts. Are there any interview questions that our managers regularly ask that drive you crazy? That is to say, what are the most common interviewing errors that get Enron into hot water? Thanks, Dave
