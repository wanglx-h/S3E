Subject: RE: Renewable Energy folder on O-drive
Elliot: Sorry, I guess Stacey and I weren't aware of it. I don't have access to your site (I had to fill out an e-request for all of us to get access to the GovAffairs site). I will request access to the West O-drive site for myself then.

Since we all have access to the O Drive, I would prefer to store all of our info there. I have created a new folder called Shared in which we can store our Competitive Analysis and other files. Howe does that sound?

Together with the internal competitive analysis web site we are developing, we can use this to keep files we all need access to. Check it out - O:\StateGovAffairs\Renewables Let me know if you have any problems accessing this. Jenny
