Subject: After work
I've had something come up today. I can still do it tomorrow, though I would hope to be able to go a little earlier than 5. Are knocking off a little earlier than usual with Nymex closing at noon? ----- Forwarded by Eric Shaw/HOU/Dynegy on 11/20/01 08:42 AM ----- Eric Shaw To: bmckay@enron.com 11/16/01 cc: 03:14 PM Subject: After work Lets' try for Tuesday - that's looking pretty good for me.
