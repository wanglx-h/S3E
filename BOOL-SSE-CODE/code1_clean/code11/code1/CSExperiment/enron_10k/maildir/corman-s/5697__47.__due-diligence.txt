Subject: Due Diligence
We have completed the benefits portion of the due diligence report on Project Canary. The highlighted portions require additional information and documentation. As per our discussion yesterday, there are numerous questions regarding Compensation in the Benefits section. It is my understanding that Compensation is responding to those issues. If you have any questions or if we can be of assistance, please let us know. Linda
