Brian, Pat Mackin requested that I forward this on to you. I think he has a good idea here to look at a process for RIF selection. Currently, it is done on an ad-hoc basis, with plans being prepared for each situation. Pat, do you still have a copy of the one you prepared a while back? It would be an excellent start. Thanks.
