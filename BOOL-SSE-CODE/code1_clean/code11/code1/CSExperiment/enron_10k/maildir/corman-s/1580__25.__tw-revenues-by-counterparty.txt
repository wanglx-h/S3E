Subject: TW Revenues by Counterparty
First worksheet show summary gross transportation revenue by counterparty for the 12 months ended 9/30/01. Total transport revenue is $180.6 million. Other worksheets show detail by contract and contract expiration dates. This information has been furnished to Kevin Howard. The only open question is how this data can be reconciled to financials. I spoke with Tracy this morning and she reflects gross operating revenues for TW for this period of $200 M. The difference is primarily fuel sales (which are not currently included in my numbers).
