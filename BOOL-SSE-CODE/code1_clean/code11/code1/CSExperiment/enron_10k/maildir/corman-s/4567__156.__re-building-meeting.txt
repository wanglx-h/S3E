Subject: Re: Building meeting
Please call if you have any questions. I would like to know what everyone wants to accomplish by this meeting. I know that Richard and Elliot have constructed some "Renewable language" in a contract we are currently working. We will bring the pricing with the $6.00 adder that Richard has suggested that we use for the power.
