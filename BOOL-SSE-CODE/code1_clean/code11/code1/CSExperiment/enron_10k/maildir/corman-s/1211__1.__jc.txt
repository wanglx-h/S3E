Mary Nell: I just wanted to tell how happy I am that all went well with JC's surgery. I do believe in miracles. I also wanted to relay to you something that I wanted to tell you awhile back, but I never did. Through all the difficult times that have taken place, you have been a true inspiration to me. I have absolutely no idea what you were going through but I tried many time to place myself in your shoes, and realized that the question I would most want answered is why. I then thought how I would react to not recieving an answer to this question and have concluded that .
