Subject: Re: Sorry we missed you
Thats cool dude. Sorry we missed you too. We had a fun time on Saturday night. Friday i took my sister to the blazer game. She had a really good time. Anyway, I have a 200 level seat behind the basket for game three of the playoffs do you want to go? It is a $76 ticket. I may be able to get game 4 (if neccesary) also if you are interested. Let me know. It should be either the 25th or 26th.
