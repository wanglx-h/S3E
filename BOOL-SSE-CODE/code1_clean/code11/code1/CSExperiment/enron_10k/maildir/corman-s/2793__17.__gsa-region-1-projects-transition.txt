Subject: GSA Region 1 Projects Transition
Rogers & Richard, We are in the process of selling (transitioning) the Projects piece of the GSA Region 1 Deal to Enron Facility Services, with the commodity piece to remain the responsibility of EES. We would like to confirm that when EFS completes a project, the resulting reduced consumption figures will not adversely affect your commodity risk position. Please indicate your acceptance of this transaction by responding to this email. Regards, Chris Wheeler
