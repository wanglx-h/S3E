Jubran, I need to know what dates these deals were done. Your spreadsheet does not say and scheduling wants to know what date to backdate it to. They have also said that they would like to see the deal ticket as I had asked before however, am I correct in assuming that since these deals had to do with the purchase of PG&E that you might not have a deal ticket on your end? I already had the spreadsheet, however, they were asking for additional information and since Diana was out I got kind of thrown in the middle of this one. Thank you for your help. Have a great weekend.
