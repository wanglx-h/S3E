Anthony, I'd like to see if you've been able to do anything about my vestment in the cash balance plan. Currently there is over $18,000 in there and based on Monday's date, I am only 6 days away from vesting. As I said before, I have turned down jobs earlier this year so that I can atleast meet this 5 year mark. Please call me at 281-485-3911 or reply as soon as possible. Thanks again Jeff lewis
