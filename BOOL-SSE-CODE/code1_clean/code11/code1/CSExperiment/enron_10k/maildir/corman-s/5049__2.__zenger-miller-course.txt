Subject: Zenger-Miller Course
I wanted to follow up with some responses to your questions in our last meeting. ? The name of the course is Forward Thinking. ? The cost is $300.00 for the facilitator materials and then $35.00 per workbook for each participate. The facilitator materials are reusable the participate workbook is not.
