Dear Leaf and Mark, I'm researching a purchase deal for 25 MW @ $15 (probably ancillary charges) on 11-30-00 for HE 24. The counterparty is showing this deal, but we are not. I have found deal # 469836 routed to El Paso deal # 469839, but the criteria do not match completely. I didn't find notes in either of your trade logs. Is there possibly a deal out there at HE 24 for exactly 25 MW @ $15.00? Please respond soon, VA
