Subject: RE: All tests were NOT successfully executed
There were no allocations for NNG for the gas day of 12/26, therefore the there is no information to display for allocations. Before relaying this information on to the group, please check with Gary Spraggins, Darrell Schoolcraft, Terry Kowalke or John Buchanan to verify there were no allocations on the pipes.
