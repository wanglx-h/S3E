Subject: RE: PEP suggested reviewers
Randy, in our meeting yesterday, I told people they could also give unsolicited feedback on any one on the team and encouraged them to do so. I will talke with Diana to get some feedback from her without her having to fill out additional forms if that sounds OK with you. Thanks.

She mostly works with the late person (Jean) and the early person (Jerry). Therefore, if it is at all possible to choose someone else from the team that I work with more closely, I would appreciate it. Thanks.

Please let me know if you have any concerns. Thanks. Lynn
