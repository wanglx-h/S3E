Subject: Monday's at the Empire Room
Hi kids! ? Hope you all are well and enjoying the?return of daylight!? I'm sending out a quick note to let you all know about my regular solo gig.? Just a couple of weeks ago, I started playing and singing every Monday night at the Empire Room at 4206 SE Hawthorne Blvd.? The Empire Room is a wonderful wine and dessert bar.? It also offers appetizers and a few dinner entrees which are on the lighter side.? Above all it is a wonderful place to spend time with friends and family and now listen to music in a smoke-free, kid friendly environment.? There is no cover charge.??I start playing around?8: 30pm?and?play for a couple of hours finishing up around?11pm. ? Hope to see you all there! ? Take care, ? jen. gosar
