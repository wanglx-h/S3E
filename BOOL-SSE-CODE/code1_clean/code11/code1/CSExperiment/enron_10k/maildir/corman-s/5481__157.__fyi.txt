Happy Birthday Marty. I hope you have a good day and a wonderful evening too. I sent you an e-card a while ago. I found out yesterday that I have to be in DC the week of November 5. I'm still up in the air about what days I'll go to Arkansas and will only stay one or two nights. I'll probably stay with Mother and Caroline. I did find a list of the bathhouses in Hot Springs where you can get a massage so I'd love to have one. I'll talk with you later. Mom
