Subject: Wire funds to Avista
Steve, Please wire $311,712 to Avista. This will cover our NW book of business from Jan 13 thru Jan 19. I have also emailed you the net P&L associated with this transaction. Tom at Avista told me they have a new bank and new wire info, but that Mallorey has already wired to the new bank, so use the bank info you used for Mallorey's last transaction with Avista. If you have any questions, please let me know. Sean
