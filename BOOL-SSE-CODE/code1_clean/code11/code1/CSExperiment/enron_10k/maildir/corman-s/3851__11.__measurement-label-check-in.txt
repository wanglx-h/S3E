Subject: Measurement Label Check-In
Ellis, Gary, Jodie and Raetta The attached documents confirm the agreements of the past two days relative to tracking and follow-up for measurement information that is not arriving in GMS on a timely basis. NOTE: The .xls reports do not contain current month information. Initiation of this improvement process is set for the Feb. 2002 close - the first week of March 2002. If I can be of assistance, please give me a call. Thanks Steve 713.345.2989
