SoCalGas Mediation (settlement discussions) Just a quick not, keep December 4th available to meet with FERC and SoCalGas in Chicago. We will begin at 9:00 a.m.. I will ask for Ann to get a meeting room at one of the hotels close to the airport. At a minimum (I'm sure there will be others), Georgetta Baker and J.P. Harrigan will be representing SoCalGas at the meeting. I will let you know more information when its available. Greg
