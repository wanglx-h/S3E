Subject: Reminder
My Peeps Just a reminder that we have a practice on Sunday from 1 to 3 PM at Westmoreland #2. I would love to see many people there because some of you still need to pay me, some of you need to field some grounders and fly balls, and some of you need to take some BP. Any questions, call me at 296-0782. Chris
