Will do, sorry you're working so late! From: Sheila Tweed on 12/07/2000 10:20 PM To: Michelle Cash/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Re: Opportunities at ENA I think that Enron internal would be fine. I have spoken with one commrcial person (Ron Coker) about her and got rave reviews. She worked very closely with Anthony Duenner so maybe you could call him and Bruce Lundstrum. Also Rob Walls. Thanks for doing this for me. I'm still a hostage.
