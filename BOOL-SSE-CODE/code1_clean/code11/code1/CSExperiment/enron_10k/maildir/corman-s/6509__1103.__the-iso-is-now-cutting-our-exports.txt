Subject: The ISO is now cutting our exports
In addition to the ISO derating its own available transmission capacity (exporting) at the California Oregon Border (so that people can't buy transmission from the ISO to export power) the ISO is now threatening to cut our exports from California using transmission rights that we have purchased from a muni that is not part of the ISO's grid.
