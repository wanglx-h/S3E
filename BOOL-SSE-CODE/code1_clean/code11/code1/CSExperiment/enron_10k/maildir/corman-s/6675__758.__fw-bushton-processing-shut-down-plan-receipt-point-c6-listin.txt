Subject: FW: Bushton Processing Shut Down Plan - Receipt Point C6+ Listing
Dan, here is the latest list. I just sent it to you since Randy and LD already have it. We have a call into John Stern about the columns and which ones to use (you probably already know the answer to that).

As you recall this list is to be used with the Bushton Procesing shut down plan to determine what receipts may have to be curtailed in the event of a shut down of the Bushton processing plant. Eric Faucheaux is working with ETS Measurement Technology to set up a process to regularly update this list. In the future these updates will not be emailed, but will be available on Optimization website, under Operating Guidelines. The Optimization team website is at: http://www.ets.enron.com/optimization/ A corp id and login are required to access the site.
