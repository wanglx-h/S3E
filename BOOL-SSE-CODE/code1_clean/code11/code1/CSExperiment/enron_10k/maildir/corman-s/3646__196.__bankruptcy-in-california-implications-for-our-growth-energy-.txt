Subject: Bankruptcy in California; Implications for our Growth Energy Name	s
Bankruptcy in California; Implications for our Growth Energy Names * We would not sell Energy Merchants/Power Producers on news that PCG has declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy. * Ongoing payments in California are being made by the state; therefore do not anticipate material exposure for ongoing earnings. * Primary exposure is current receivables: (1) these one-time amounts are limited (roughly estimate max. of 50% of 2001 earnings); and (2) we expect that, as trade creditors, they will get high priority in a bankruptcy proceeding. We think most of these amounts are likely to be recoverable, although a significant (perhaps several year) delay is possible as these claimants work their way through the bankruptcy process. * By our rough estimation, companies with fairly significant one-time earnings exposure include: NRG, MIR, DYN, CPN. Companies with fairly small exposure include: ENE, AES, WMB, EPG and DUK. <<PCG bankruptcy 4-9-01.pdf>> <<PCG bankruptcy 4-9-01.doc>> Raymond C.
