Subject: Out of the Office - Rick
I will not be in today. I am not feeling well - sinus drainage, sore throat, body aches. If you need me, you can reach me at home at (281) 359-6258. I will follow up with my group to make sure I have everything covered for today and prepared for tomorrow's Customer Accounts Meetings. Rick
