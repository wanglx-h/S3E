Steve, I received the message from Rod on California demand. Are Linde and Kim available to assist Rod? See also if we can get something from Lorna Brennan. Let me know if there is any kind of problem in responding to Rod. Dan -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net)
