Subject: more fun
many thanks to those that responded to my plea for money. if those checks are really in the mail then we should be registered this week. i am thinking of going to the batting cages on Thursday, so if anyone else is interested let me know. if you havent sent in a check yet, then meet me there if you can. the batting cages that i go to are near the malibu grand prix on hwy 217 and scholls ferry (across from your friends in the diamond business), and i think 8pm is a good time. keep the money coming and see ya later. chris
