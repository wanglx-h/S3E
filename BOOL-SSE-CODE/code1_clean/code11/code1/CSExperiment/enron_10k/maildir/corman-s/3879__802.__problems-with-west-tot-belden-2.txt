Subject: Problems with West tot belden 2
Dear all: Please note that on 3/9 we have problems with west tot belden 2. Specifically, the positions we got in west tot belden 2 were not matching what we got from West Position file (* this file has positions by region, not by desk). Houston IT confirmed that West Position is correct, but not for west tot belden2, and they are trying to fix the problems during this weekend. Please let me know if you have any concerns or questions. If you need to use this west tot belden 2 file during the weekend, our IT contact will be Zhiyun Yang (6-853-3208 or pager at 1-713-327-4356). Regards, Fran x7973 home: 503-460-2052
