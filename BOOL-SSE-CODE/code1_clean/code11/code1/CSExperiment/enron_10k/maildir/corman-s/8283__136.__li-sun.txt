Subject: Li Sun
I just got a call from Li Sun. She is expecting to get her H-1 visa anytime, and wants to make sure that she receives it. Should we have her contact Tindall & Foster directly? Also, by law, when an individual on an H-1b visa is terminated, the company is required to provide them a one way ticket back to their home country. Does that still apply in a bankruptcy? If so, who will be handling those arrangements? Terry Bosien Human Resource Manager Associate & Analyst Program 713/853-5230
