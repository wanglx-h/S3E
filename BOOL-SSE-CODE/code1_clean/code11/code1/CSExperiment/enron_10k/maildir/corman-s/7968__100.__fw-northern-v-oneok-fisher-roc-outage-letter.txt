Subject: FW: Northern v. ONEOK/Fisher Roc Outage Letter
FYI. To keep you guys in the loop. As we get additional info, I will pass it on. Thanks. Lynn -----Original Message----- From: Davis, Britt Sent: Thursday, September 20, 2001 4:31 PM To: Fossum, Drew Cc: Porter, Gregory J.; Ringblom, Kathy; Zikes, Becky; Lowry, Phil; Craig, Rick; Kile, Rick; Dietz, Rick; Woodson, Harry; Anderson, Gary E.; Mendez, Angela; Dykes, Tangie; Blair, Lynn; Cessac, Kenneth Subject: Northern v. ONEOK/Fisher Roc Outage Letter Drew, Grant is putting the finishing touches on the proposed letter to ONEOK explaining the Fisher Roc lock up period of September 12-16 and what we will do to resolve it. Long and short, we are declaring that this is an "error in the Inlet/Outlet meter formula", rather than a "Btu measurement error," because there was nothing wrong with Northern's chromatograph that caused this problem. Accordingly, we will not be using the Plant's PTR during the outage period, but rather a formula based on the ratio between the rich inlet and rich outlet volumes for a period of time before and after the outage period, as per 2b.(iv) of the Measurement Agreement. I will circulate a draft of the letter to all by e-mail once I get it from Grant. It is prepared for signature by Ken Cessac. Questions: 1. Who with ETS needs to be on the copy list on this and any future letters regarding measurement errors at Bushton? 2. Who at ONEOK (maybe more than one person?) should receive this letter? Many thanks for your input. Britt
