Subject: November RT Market Default Invoice
FYI ---------------------- Forwarded by Mary Hain/HOU/ECT on 02/09/2001 09:43 AM --------------------------- Murray P O'Neil 02/09/2001 08:49 AM To: gfergus@burbeck.com cc: Christian Yoder/HOU/ECT@ECT, Steve C Hall/PDX/ECT@ECT, Mary Hain/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: November RT Market Default Invoice Gary, Attached you will find a November RT (Real Time) Market Default Invoice which was receive by EPMI from the PX this morning. This invoice was published on the PX Settlement Web Site. Again, the PX failed to notify market participants that this invoice was out there. Normally they would send an email out and inform all market participants of it's availability. If Market Participants don't know about this invoice being out there they will end up defaulting on their payments. (That may be what the PX wants so they can go after the collateral. If you have any questions please let me know. Good luck today! - MO
