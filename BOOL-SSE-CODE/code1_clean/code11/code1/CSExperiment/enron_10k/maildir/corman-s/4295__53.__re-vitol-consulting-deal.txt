anything you can find out about vitol would be interesting. my fax # 713-853-1838 -----Original Message----- From: "Neil Kelley" <neil@kelley.com>@ENRON Sent: Monday, June 25, 2001 1:25 PM To: Whalley, Greg Subject: RE: Vitol consulting deal Not a problem, I'm sure it was just an oversight. Your assistant left a msg on Friday asking me to forward another copy of invoice. I don't have electronic copy but can fax hard copy to you. Plse advise fax number. On the Vitol front, they just celebrated their 35th anniversary last weekend with a companywide outing in Spain. I'm having lunch with some of the guys on Wednesday and will give you brief on latest sentiment on strategic front.
