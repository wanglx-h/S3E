Lynn, Yes. John aked me to attend the conference call along with Steve and Terry and....as Steve notes below, Kent is aware of the issue.

Chris was on the call also. We got nowhere, so then Kent and Steve Kirk called them later and explained how the process works and that we can't "reserve" capacity for them. They hung up on Steve and Kent. Shelley has been brought up to speed. thanks. sj -----Original Message----- From: Blair, Lynn Sent: Wednesday, November 21, 2001 10:34 AM To: 'mike.bodnar@enron.com'; January, Steve Subject: Fw: Storage Allocations Mike are you awawre of this?

For the weekend, we want to schedule maximum storage withdrawals (to protect against zone allocations) and we want to "schedule" the firm right to reduce our withdrawal to zero in the final nomination cycle. We expect NNG to honor our FIRM MAX RATE storage contract rights before they schedule a single dth of interruptible storage. Please confirm our firm rights for all 3 of our Alliant Energy Utilities. We would like this confirmation by 3:00pm this afternoon in order to properly notify our customers of any necessary constraints.
