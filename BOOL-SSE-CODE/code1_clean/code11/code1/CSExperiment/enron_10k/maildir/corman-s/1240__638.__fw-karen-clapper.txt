Lynn- What do you think? Thanks Fran -----Original Message----- From: Southard, Miranda Sent: Wednesday, November 21, 2001 11:12 AM To: Fagan, Fran Subject: RE: Karen Clapper Do you want me to call it a transfer or a data correction? Also, what effective date should I use? I think we should use Jan. 1st for all corrections if we are changing company number to be on the safe side with regard to the employees' tax deductions. Let me know what you think. We will probably get many co./cost center change requests for the new year.
