Subject: Length for Monday
We have length on peak Monday, 04-23 in NP-15. The energy is in PGE3, 25 mws are under ST-WBOM and 56 mws are in ST-CALI. We need to sell all 81 mws. In Enpower we buy the 25 mws from imbalance under ST-WBOM, and sell them under ST-WBOM. ST-WBOM is long at $230. We buy the 56 mws under the ST-CALI book and then sell it off for a profit split under the ST-CALI book. I will be in Seattle this weekend. If you have any questions, you can reach me on my cell phone. Thanks, Bill
