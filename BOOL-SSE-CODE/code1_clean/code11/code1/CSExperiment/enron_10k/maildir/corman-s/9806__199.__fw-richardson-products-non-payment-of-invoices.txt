Subject: FW: Richardson Products Non-payment of Invoices
fyi -----Original Message----- From: Dietz, Rick Sent: Friday, December 28, 2001 9:43 AM To: McCarty, Danny; Corman, Shelley; Harris, Steven Subject: Richardson Products Non-payment of Invoices FYI - In case you have not yet heard... Richardson Products has not paid their $1,661,000 TW line pack sales invoice. They are claiming to have a Global Netting Agreement with Enron and are netting this payment with ENA and EGL issues. We asked for a copy of this agreement even though we are certain that TW is not a party to it. Paul Cherry, TK, Steve Kleb and I are all following up with our counterparts and are giving the collection of this money top priority. We will keep you informed. Rick
