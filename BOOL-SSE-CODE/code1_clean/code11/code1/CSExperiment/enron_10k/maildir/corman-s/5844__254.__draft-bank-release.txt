Subject: Draft Bank Release
The attached press release is the latest draft, which has been approved by Enron and one part of Citigroup. JPMorgan is still reviewing, as is another part of Citigroup. The release includes several bracketed phrases and sentences that are still being discussed. In the first paragraph, Citigroup wants to use "including due diligence" and delete "final." In the fifth paragraph, Citigroup wants to use the phrase "in a few days" rather than "shortly." The quote from JPMorgan may or may not be in the final release. Once the terms of the agreement are finalized, we plan to issue this release before the opening of the market Thursday (6 a.m.). If you have any comments or changes, please let me and Steve Kean know by email or voicemail. Thank you. Karen x39757
