Terry, who requested these to be done before the 8:00 a.m. meeting? Let's discuss. Thanks.

This has not been the procedure in the past. If these numbers are asked for in the morning meeting, they can be quickly obtained or the previous days numbers are available. -----Original Message----- From: Benningfield, Robert Sent: Friday, August 24, 2001 5:30 PM To: Blair, Lynn; Adams, Jean; Benningfield, Robert; Dykes, Tangie; Forbish, Sherry; Greaney, Chris; Hibbard, Scott; Janzen, Randy; Linhart, Joe; McDaniel, Janet; Scurlock, Debra; Sturr, Kathy; Woodson, Harry Cc: Berger, Larry; Bodnar, Michael; Buchanan, John; Kowalke, Terry; Schoolcraft, Darrell; Spraggins, Gary; Zadow, Raetta Subject: Daily Bushton and Oneok File We need to complete the Oneok Recap and the Bushton (PVR) file, before the 8:00 A.M. Meeting, EACH DAY. I asked to create a Bushton Group to assist our team in completing the Bushton file. Please contact me if you have any questions.
