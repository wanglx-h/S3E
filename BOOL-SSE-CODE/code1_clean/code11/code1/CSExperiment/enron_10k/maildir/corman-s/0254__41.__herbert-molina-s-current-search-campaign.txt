Subject: Herbert Molina's current search campaign
Gentlemen: I good friend at Sun suggested me to contact all of you at Enron in regard to the direction of my current searching campaign as I have made the decision to leave my post as Vice President and General Manager of Network Associates Latin America and Caribbean. It is of my understanding that Enron is undergoing a huge internal transformation to become one of the leading E-Commerce players worldwide. Network Associates is the leading and independent provider of total security software solutions to monitor and protect telecommunications, E-Commerce and internet applications worldwide. Since I was given the mission to start the region in 1996 I have been instrumental to increase sales from 2M to 35M US in 4 years. I have been in charge of supervising and managing over 100 employees across the region and the US with complete P&L responsibilities. Previous to join NAI, I worked for Seagate where I had the responsibilitity to set up the whole supply chain in South Florida and and across the region resulting in a sales increase from 25M to 125M US in 4 years. With over 20 years of experience selling and transfering technology internationally I feel proud of my record and accomplishments. Should any of you be interested in talking to me about any opportunity within any of your organizations, please do not hesitate to call me at 954-452-0664. Thank you in advance for your positive consideration. Best regards, Herbert Arturo Molina
