Subject: EL PASO EMAIL ADDRESS
Just letting you know EL Paso now has another person that needs to get the model everyday. Also, Roger has not been getting the model consistently. I don't know if this is an email system problem or an oversight by us. Either way it makes us look bad. Here is the new email address put it in your address book and use it wisely:) kpeterso@epelectric.com, rhawki1@epelectric.com, dmilik1@epelectric.com Thanks Leaf
