Subject: Re: FERC Filings in Connection with PSCo Project
Usually, ENA legal hires outside counsel, but I'd be happy to assist you and outside counsel on it. I don't know who legal typically uses although I'm pretty sure Dale used Dan Watkiss of Bracewell and Patterson for one project. Power marketers proposals are tariff filings for market-based rates under Section 205 of the Federal Power Act. The Commission has 60 days to accept them from the date FERC notices the filing in the Federal Register or the filing is deemed accepted. EWG applications are made under Section 32 of the Public Utiluty Holding Company Act. Thereunder, the Commission must make an EWG determination within 60 days of its receipt of an EWG application.

How do we prefer to take care of the required FERC filings for Market Based Rate Authorization and for EWG status in connection with power plant developments? I ask this in the context of the PSCo project, where we have a project LLC as the development vehicle, and we anticipate selling the LLC before commercial operation. Specifically, do we do this in-house with govt. affairs people, through Enron DC office people, through outsside counsel for the project, through outside counsel not otherwise affiliated with the project, or otherwise? And, when do we usually do the filings? Thanks. Al Larsen
