Subject: RE: Maternity Leave Question
I think that the answer is that she will be eligible for the $4500 and will be allowed to continue whatever medical coverage she had elected already until 12/31. Please refer her to the Q&As on the web site for details.

She had her baby on November 14th and will be under a doctor's care until January. She informed me that she also received the news that she will not qualify for unemployment while under a doctor's care. Please advise. Thanks.
