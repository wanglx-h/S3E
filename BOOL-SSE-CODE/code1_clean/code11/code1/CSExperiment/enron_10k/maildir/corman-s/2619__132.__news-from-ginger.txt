Subject: News from Ginger
I talked to Ginger this morning. She received my dossier and is sending it for translation. She said she will be at Chris Ivins today reviewing dossiers. She also said that there is a possible change in document requirements that would require that certain documents be "apostilled" in Austin. I asked Ginger to send you the picture of Oksana. She said that she thought she had already had. She said she left you a voice message & would try to call you again later. Talk to you soon.
