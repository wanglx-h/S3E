Subject: Peoples Gas conversation
Shelley, An FYI--Teb & I had a conversation w/Raye Grimaard at Peoples Gas today in regard to the scheduling allocation process. She indicated they do not like FGT's process "one little bit" regarding their flexibility to schedule secondary firm in an allocated area. For instance, when we allocate the market area, and Peoples wants to nominate secondary gas within their path, they feel they should have the priority to do so and not be in he mix for a cut. Teb was highly concerned about this in light of the implications it could have on ultimately changing to a mileage rate base. Teb argued the point that we rarely cut into firm gas, thus is their threat to file with the Ferc for within the path segmentation really necessary. He asked that we have an opportunity to review this with them at greater length before they file. In the meantime, I will look into the number of times we have allocated firm in the market area. I'm not sure how far back I can get accurate information though. I'm afraid it will be more memory facts than hard facts. Sheila
