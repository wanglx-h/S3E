Subject: RE: New Business Fax
Peggy, Your email notice was timely as I was just thinking about you. I have wanted to congratulate you on your promotion. I am so happy for you. I find it validating, especially at this time at Enron, to know that good things do happen to good people. Give me a call if you can ever break free for lunch. I would like to catch up with you on business matters, and more importantly, on international adoptions. I know that you have already navigated these waters and I am looking forward to travel to Kazakhstan to adopt a little girl. Best wishes to you and your family for the holidays.
