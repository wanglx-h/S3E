Looks fine to me. -----Original Message----- From: Rapp, Bill Sent: Friday, November 16, 2001 2:45 PM To: Harris, Steven; Watson, Kimberly; Lindberg, Lorraine; Miller, Mary Kay; Kilmer III, Robert; Lokey, Teb; Veatch, Stephen; Martens, Donna; Petersen, Keith Cc: Porter, Gregory J.; Pryor, Tony; Dornan, Dari Subject: Transwestern Red Rock Expansion Attached for your review and comments is a draft of a request to FERC to extend the period allowed under the Red Rock certificate for the abandonment and replacement of the compressors at Station 4. My understanding is that we need to request a one year extension as to Station 4 (but not as to the other three compressor stations included in the Red Rock expansion) due to the fact that we haven't fully contracted for all of the capacity authorized by FERC. Your comments would be appreciated. Thanks. << File: TWFERCExtension.doc >>
