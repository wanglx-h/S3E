Subject: Sorry we missed you
Guz, Sorry we missed you this last weekend. Did you and your sister have a good weekend? I remember you mentioning that you were going to take her to the Blazer game and some other things. Give me a call soon, we are going to have to block out some time to watch the Blazer Laker series when it starts (if the trail gangsters can even get that far). Later, Rick _____________________________________________________________ http://www.osubeavers.com - The Official Athletic Site of Oregon State Beaver Fans!
