Subject: Scheduling Time w/Greg Whalley
Hi Drew, Greg will be in the London office from early Tuesday afternoon through end-of-business day on Thursday, June 7. Are you available to meet w/him for about an hour? He's available Tuesday afternoon until 5:00 p.m. Wednesday there are a few slots available, and Thursday he is wide open. If you could e-mail me your availability that would be great. Also, Greg will be carrying mobile number +44 7901516638. Many Thanks, Liz Taylor
