-----Original Message----- From: Ann Greene <apgreene@ruf.rice.edu>@ENRON Sent: Friday, November 30, 2001 2:05 PM To: undisclosed-recipients:;@ENRON Subject: Enron Owls Rice University realizes that these are difficult times for those alumni who are employed at Enron. We therefore invite you to attend a meeting on Friday, December 7th at 3:00 p.m. in the Grand Hall of the Rice Memorial Center to discuss how we might be of assistance. We have email addresses for many but not all of you, so please pass the word to your fellow Owls. We have also created a website on which we will post information about available services - http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~opa/enronowls. Take care.
