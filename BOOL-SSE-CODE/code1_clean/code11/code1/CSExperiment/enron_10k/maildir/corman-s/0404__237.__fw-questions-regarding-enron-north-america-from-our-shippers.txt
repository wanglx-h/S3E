Subject: FW: QUESTIONS REGARDING ENRON NORTH AMERICA FROM OUR SHIPPERS
1. NNG and ENA are entirely separate entities and our businesses are run entirely separate from one another. 2. Customers may think that they can net ENA invoices against NNG invoices. NNG is a separate business and is not responsible for ENA invoices to their customers. 3. Should suppliers cut volumes for ENA; NNG will cut the market accordingly. 4. Creditworthiness status for ENA remains the responsibility of the Commercial Department. We are to maintain our normal course of business until instructed otherwise.
