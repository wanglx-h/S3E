Subject: RE: Severance Announcement
You should indicate that the severance plan is subject to the approval of the Enron Corp. Board of Directors. We do have a plan in place, but we haven't terminated any employees under that plan in the last few weeks. So, we can't say that there is not plan in place righ now. Michelle -----Original Message----- From: Russi, Estalee Sent: Thursday, November 29, 2001 11:15 AM To: Cash, Michelle Subject: Severance Announcement Importance: High Sensitivity: Confidential Wes Colwell held a floor meeting yesterday where he announced what he thought the severance packages would look like, 1 1/2 weeks for each year of service and 1 1/2 weeks for every $10,000 of your annual salary maximum of 39 weeks no doubling. Apparently that is not correct or has not been approved so I was going to send out the following announcement to those who attended his meeting for clarification. Please give me your feedback as soon as possible. Estalee Yesterday in Wes Colwell's floor meeting a possible Severance Plan scenario was discussed. The Severance Plan is under review and at this time we do not have a defined plan in place. Once we know exactly what the plan will look like we will communicate to you as quickly as possible. We are sorry for any misunderstanding there may be. Please feel free to contact your HR Representative with any additional questions.
