Subject: Enron Online - Cal 05 & 04 Kevin - The following counterparties were approved to EOL trading through Cal'05 for East Physical Power. As we agreed, the charge would be $0.10/mwh for both '04 and '05 and this would be revisited in December of this year. The list of counterparties approved was based on a list provided by you a month or so back. Please pass on the information to you trading desks. rgds, Ed Sacks Allegheny Energy Supply LLC BP Energy Company Conectiv Energy Supply Duke Energy Trading and Marketing El Paso Merchant Energy, L.P.
