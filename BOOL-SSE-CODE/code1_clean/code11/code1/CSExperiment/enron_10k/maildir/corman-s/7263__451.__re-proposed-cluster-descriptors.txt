Subject: Re: proposed cluster descriptors
Gina, I am not sure that the "Satisfactory" descriptor is accurate. "Met" expectations probably does not fit the average person's view of a person in Satisfactory. Perhaps "met most, but not all" or something like that would be more accurate. Where are we on the total revamp? Has that been postponed until next year? Thanks. Michelle Enron North America Corp.

We would like to have these reviewed by the VP/MD PRC Committee tomorrow , but wanted to ensure that you saw them first. They comprise merely a refinement of the present descriptors, with an effort to demonstrating "relativity". let me know your thoughts, thanks, G
