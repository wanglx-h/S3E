Hi Mark, I'm really sorry to have heard about your Dad. I know I'm just one on a long list of people that always enjoyed his company, hospitality and high spirits...he always treated me like a bro and I know how much he meant to you. I'm heading north to Humboldt with Stacey this afternoon (been in Sac all week) and will probably be there for a little while. Be sure to let me know where you're gonna be, 'cause I plan on heading further north sometime. Hope to see you soon, and I'll be in touch until then... -Marc Get FREE Email/Voicemail with 15MB at Lycos Communications at http://comm.lycos.com
