Subject: Public Service Co. of New Mexico Chargeback Complaint
As you know, PSNM filed its own chargeback complaint in Docket No. EL01-43-000, raising many of the same issues that we raised in our complaint. Interventions are due March 22. We were going to file a short intervention supporting PSNM's complaint, referencing our complaint, and adding some minor comments. However, in light of the PX's bankruptcy filing, I have been advised by Jim Hughmoeller that we such a filing is subject to the automatic stay and we are unable to file at this time. As a result, we will simply file a short suggestion of bankruptcy letter on March 22 similar to the letters that we filed last week in our chargeback complaint proceeding and the PX's Amendment No. 22 proceeding. Once the stay is lifted (hearing to be held on March 28), we will expeditiously file our intervention and comments. Ron
