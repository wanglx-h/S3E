In addition to some wordsmithing and the like, please note footnote 1, which is new. We are still researching for California cases that support the FERC cases we have cited (for proposition that economic hardship does not constitute force majuere). This needs to be filed today, so please give me your comments quickly. Thanks. Ron - 138786R.wpd - 0138786.wpd
