Subject: RE: Andrew Makk
Sarah, At this time, I do not believe that this is a legal issue. Mary Joyce, in Executive Compensation, approves all terms and conditions of VP employment agreements. Before we agree to modify any non-compete, there must be buy-in from Mary first. Only then would we consider the request from the legal perspective. Even then, I am not sure that it is a precedent we would want to set for someone under a US agreement. -----Original Message----- From: Gregory, Sarah Sent: Wednesday, September 19, 2001 10:19 AM To: Cash, Michelle Cc: Laing, Melissa Subject: Andrew Makk Michelle I left a message with you earlier but I don't know if you are around today. As you know, Andrew Makk is to be a seconded employee from the US to London. I understand there is some debate about the restricitive covenant which has been agreed with Andrew will be 6 months in all circumstances. Could we discuss how we might achieve this result as soon as possible. Many thanks Sarah Gregory Assistant General Counsel Telephone +44 20 7783 6974 Facsimile +44 20 7783 9037
