Subject: FW: Alliant Retro Schedule Language
Shelley, I would like your opinion on a statement we are considering putting into a letter to Alliant to address some issues they have. See what you think of this paragraph. I am trying to think of another word other than "retroactively" (that word bothers me). They are trying to get this letter out this week. Thanks for your help. Lynn -----Original Message----- From: Sebesta, Chris Sent: Tuesday, January 15, 2002 11:30 AM To: Blair, Lynn Subject: Alliant Retro Schedule Language In our meeting, it was suggested to delete the phrase where Northern "would only consider a change which includes but is not limited to ..." and rewrote as follows: Alliant requested Northern be more flexible and, if requested, consider from time to time to make retroactive scheduling changes. Northern's practice is to NOT retroactively schedule quantities. At any time a shipper has requested a review of scheduled quantities, Northern will review the situation on non-discriminatory, case-by-case basis. If a situation arises, Alliant should call Lynn Blair at 713-853-7637. Let me know if this is okay or if you have comments. Thanks!
