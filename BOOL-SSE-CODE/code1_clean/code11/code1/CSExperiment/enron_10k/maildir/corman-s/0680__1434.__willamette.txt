Guzman, Willamette enpower deals were still entered in incorrectly for 12/20, and made it through the SAR that way. I fixed them this morning. Concerning IPC, I cannot tell from your email if you spoke with IPC or what resolution you arrived at. If EPMI is found to be responsible and you are unable to resolve the issue, you need to draft a letter to me with all the appropriate information concerning the trade. I will then explain the discrepancy to EPE. Please get me the complete information as quickly as possible. Thank you, Bill
