Subject: New position - Happy New Year
Hey Steve - I just wanted to touch base with you prior to the new year. I have accepted a position for the next year in Lake Jackson beginning on January 2nd. Hopefully a year is all it will take to get a teaching certificate. I look forward to seeing how the energy job market looks after this time. At least with this position I have a good couple of months off during the summer. Any way, I hope you had a nice Christmas and have a safe new year as well. I'll talk with you later.
