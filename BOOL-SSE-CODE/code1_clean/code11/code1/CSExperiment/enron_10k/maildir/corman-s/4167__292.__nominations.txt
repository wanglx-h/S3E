Subject: Nominations
Hello Corporate HANDS Parents- Thank you for taking the time to nominate your child's program. We are in the process of sending the centers paperwork to fill out and return to us. You might want to verify this with your director. The information they send back will be reviewed for their needs and the number of Corporate HANDS families they serve. The Corporate HANDS company representatives will get the reports in December and in January we will notify the centers of the results.
