Subject: Tour & Review of the Gas Logistic's Interim Offsite at the Hangar
When: Wednesday, February 20, 2002 11:00 AM-2:00 PM (GMT-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada). Where: Car pool out to the Hangar *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* We will car pool out to the Hangar, leaving around 11AM and arriving by 11:30. We will provide you with driving directions. We'll do a quick walk-through, demonstrate connectivity to the business and Gas Control systems, and then have a working lunch (catered in from Jason's deli) in the 2nd floor conference room. We'll be reviewing the room layouts and the activation and setup process. I would expect to be back in the office by 1PM, but no later than 2PM. Please make arrangements with your team for car pooling out. It would be good practice to drive out if you haven't been out to the Hangar before.
