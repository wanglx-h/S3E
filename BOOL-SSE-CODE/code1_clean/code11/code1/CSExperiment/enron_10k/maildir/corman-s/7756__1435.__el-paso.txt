Bill, during HE 17 IID had a 130 MW Firm in the scrape and in the model. When checking out with IID they stated they had 120 MW only. In speaking with Joe at IID they stated that they spoke with Tony at 14:13 PST and told him to put in 120 for HE 17 and 18 MST. I agreed to check out with their number as it appears that there was a miscommunication between IID, Tony, and David (who was working during that shift). You may want to ask Tony when he comes in if he recalls this conversation. Thank you for your attention to this matter.
