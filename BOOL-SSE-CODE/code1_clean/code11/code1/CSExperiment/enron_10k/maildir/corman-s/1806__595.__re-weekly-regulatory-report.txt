Subject: Re: Weekly Regulatory Report
For the East (outside of the Northeast): I don't think we need to intervene in any of the dockets. --EPMI is participating in the Arizona Public Service interconnection proceeding and I have been notifying Mary, etal of the status. Also, I have provided the APX filings in PJM, New England, etal. to the traders (orders approving the filings are listed in this attachment.)
