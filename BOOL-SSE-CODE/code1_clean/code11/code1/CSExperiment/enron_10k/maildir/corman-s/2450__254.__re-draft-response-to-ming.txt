Valeria. This looks good. I would suggest that we tweak the language in the third paragraph to say that we remain willing to provide feedback, instead of saying that we would like to. Also, he last sentence of that paragraph should ask whether she would like to pursue that option instead of asking about her availability. Finally, I would delete the paragraph about lawyers. Thanks.
