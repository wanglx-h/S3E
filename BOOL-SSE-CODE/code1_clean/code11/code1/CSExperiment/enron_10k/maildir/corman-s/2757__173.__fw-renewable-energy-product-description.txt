Subject: FW: Renewable Energy Product Description
-----Original Message----- From: Ring, Richard Sent: Tuesday, October 09, 2001 4:09 PM To: Mainzer, Elliot Subject: Renewable Energy Product Description Elliott, Based on your request I have taken the opportunity to modify your Renewable Product Description, see attached. I hope that your are not offended by the quantity of modifications. Actually, the PJM region is located within the "MAAC" region and not "MAAP". I would also like to see a product for each region that represents (i) 50% wind (ii) 50% wind 50% biomass. In addition, we could have two sets of prices (i) utilizing new renewables and (ii) utilizing existing renewables. Let me know if you have any questions. Richard
