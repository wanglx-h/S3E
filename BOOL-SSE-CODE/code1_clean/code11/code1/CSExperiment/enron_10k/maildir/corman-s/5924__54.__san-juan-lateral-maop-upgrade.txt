Subject: San Juan Lateral MAOP Upgrade
We have been asked to expedite a waiver request or whatever regulatory vehicle is appropriate to try to secure an MAOP increase on the TW San Juan Lateral. An initial meeting to outline the approach, tasks and responsibilities has been scheduled for Thursday morning, April 19, at 10:30 in conference room 3AC 31C1. Please confirm that you or a representative will be able to attend. It is important that we meet on Thursday, as we have some meetings with integrity consultants on Friday and Monday and will need to brief them on what help will be needed on this project.
