Subject: Re: Contact infor for harassment training
Marty, Gracie Presas is asking about training for ENA for harassment. As we discussed, I think it would be a good idea to offer several sessions to Enron global wholesale and ENW, to maximize efficiency. So, I told her to call you. The lawyer contact on this is Kerry Notestine at Littler Mendelson. His number is 713-652-4748. Thanks. Michelle
