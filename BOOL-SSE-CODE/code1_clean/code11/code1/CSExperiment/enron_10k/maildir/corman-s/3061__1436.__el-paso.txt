Bill, per our conversation last night I phoned PAC to see if they could put in the disputed Idaho deal. They stated that they could not do that. They were very nice about it an stated that they have problems with Idaho quite often but they had to turn away several customers during that hour and would not be able to add our schedule. I have deleted the deals from enpower and I have deleted them from the El Paso sheet however, I did not do a final checkout with Idaho Power for those hours in case we have any further recourse on this issue. Thank you for your help in this matter and please let me know what you need me to do to further resolve this issue.
