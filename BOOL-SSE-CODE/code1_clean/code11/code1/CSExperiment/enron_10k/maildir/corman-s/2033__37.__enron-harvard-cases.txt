Subject: Enron Harvard cases
Friends... Chris Bartlett at Harvard presented (last week) the 2 most recent Enron cases he wrote to the "Harvard Program for Global Leadership". This is an Exec Ed program for CXO's and Senior management from throughout the world. Chris called me today to say that the cases received outstanding reviews, and that the largely international CXO audience was both knowledgeable about, and very 'pro-Enron'! Best! --Christie.
