Subject: FERC Discussion on OFOs
Per Jan's recent Commission meeting summary I just noticed the Commission had added a discussion item on OFOs. They didn't get to this at yesterday's meeting, but will take up on Oct. 11. Help Joe -- what is this about? Is there some possibility of the FERC curbing our ability to use OFOs? This is an absolutely critical tool for us to keep -- even though we seldom use. Where/when can we make our case. RE: G-33. DOCKET# GX01-1 000 Discussion of Gas Pipeline Operational Flow Orders
