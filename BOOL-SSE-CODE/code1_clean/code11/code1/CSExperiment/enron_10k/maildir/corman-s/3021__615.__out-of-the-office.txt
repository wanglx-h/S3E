Steve and Lynn I still have a sore thorat and having difficulties in swallowing food. Last night, I was informed that on Friday evening I was also exposed to "Hepatitis A". I will be trying to get a doctor appointment for this morning for re-evaluation. I will keep you posted. Sorry for the inconvience. Terry Kowalke
