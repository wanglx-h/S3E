Subject: Transalta Service Summary
jmf ---------------------- Forwarded by John M Forney/HOU/ECT on 10/20/2000 03:23 PM --------------------------- From: Stewart Rosman on 10/20/2000 10:49 AM To: John M Forney/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Transalta Service Summary John here is a brief summary of a service transaction which we have with Transalta: Enron serves as schedule coordinator for Transalta for all SC-SC trades and exports on a day ahead basis. The exports are exposed to transmission cuts and could affect real time. All costs are passed through to Transalta so it is key we record when energy does not flow to Victorville Lugo. Perhaps to help record what activity gets done on a daily basis Les or myself should record in Lotus Notes the transactions that are exported. Let me know if that will solve any confusion. Thanks. Stewart PS I need your real time service numbers for Aug, Sept
