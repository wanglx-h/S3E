Janet, I will add Harry to your evaluation. Thanks.

Kathy does not know that much of what I do and we do not share customers as Harry & I have done. She is also new again to scheduling, so all those facets of my performance would be missing. I might add that at midyear Harry was also unavailable for my review, and yet because of our close proximity, he knows better than anyone on the team how I spend my days. At the end of the day, none of this may matter, but it is a concern today. Thank you for your consideration.

Please let me know if you have any concerns. Thanks. Lynn
