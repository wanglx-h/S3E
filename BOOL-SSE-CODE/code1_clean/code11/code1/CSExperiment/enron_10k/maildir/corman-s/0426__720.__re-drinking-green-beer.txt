This evening we have dinner plans. But your ideas for saturday are good. The plan right now is to go to Kells in the afternoon (1:00 - 2:00) and beat the rush. I will get the exact times from Heidi today and let you know. As for later, we are open to anything (almost anyting). When I find out more information I will call or email you.
