Subject: Standards for Approval - ISAS E-Tag Business Practices
Diana, As I recall, you are our rep on the ISAS. I have read the E-Tag document and it looks OK to me. Are there any problems with the document from your perspective that I should be aware of? It looks like the new procedure will be in effect within a month or so (I assume after any voting as noted below) In the meantime, there will be a WMIC meeting on August 23 and 24 that I plan on attending, if there are any issues you have with the linked document below or anything else, please let me know so I can raise the issue at the WMIC. Thanks, Dave ---------------------- Forwarded by Dave Perrino/SF/ECT on 07/27/2001 09:06 AM --------------------------- laurel@wscc.com@wscc.com on 07/26/2001 04:02:51 PM Sent by: Maiser@wscc.com To: "WSCC Standards Announcement" <wsccstds@wscc.com> cc: Subject: Standards for Approval - ISAS E-Tag Business Practices WSCC STANDARDS CORRESPONDENTS OPERATIONS COMMITTEE AND OC SUBCOMMITTEES PLANNING COORDINATION COMMITTEE AND PCC SUBCOMMITTEES In accordance with the WSCC "Process for Developing and Approving WSCC Standards," the ISAS E-Tag Business Practices has been posted for approval on the WSCC Web site http://www.wscc.com/files/ISAS_Business_Practices_Final.pdf Approval of the document will be requested by ballot after the 30-day posting period.
