Thanks, I needed a little bedtime reading! -----Original Message----- From: Howard, Kevin A. Sent: Tuesday, March 19, 2002 5:47 PM To: Corman, Shelley Subject: NNG revised business plan Shelley: Thanks for your comments - we got an extra day to work through these so your timing was good. I have attached the revised business plan that incorporates more formatting changes than anything else. I will incorporate your changes in the next turnaround along with the Batchelder comments, due tomorrow. Thanks for your assistance on this. Kevin ps - Thanks for lunch yesterday. << File: NNG Revised Bus Plan 31902.doc >>
