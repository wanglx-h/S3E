Hi There. So glad you are back. How was skiing? Hope we can get together on Sat. or Sun. I never know the polite way to suggest gifts. Perhaps just a gift ideas list?

Corman (E-mail) Subject: Shower plans Hi! The invites are nearly ready to go. I just need the map to Rosemary's home. Also, Shelley -- we discussed that you may want to direct people to certain things or places for gifts (e.g., books). Let me know what you the invite to say and, if clothes are still an option, remind me what sizes. Thanks! C.Baily
