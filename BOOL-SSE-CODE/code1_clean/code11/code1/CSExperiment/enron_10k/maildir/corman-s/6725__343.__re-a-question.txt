Terrie, Cole; I'm forwarding these to Michelle. Michelle, my view: 1. Employees who qualify to the 401K class, may exercise their rights without risking their severance. The severance waiver is not a universal surrender of rights to bring claims. Regards, Rj. -----Original Message----- From: James, Terrie Sent: Tuesday, November 27, 2001 12:09 PM To: Brown, Cole; Johnson, Rick Subject: A Question Rick or Cole, PR received the following question. We'd like to have an answer prepared, but don't plan to post it or include it in any of the Q&A that will accompany scripts. (You may want to include it in an HR Q&A or post to LiveLink.) Q. If I am a party to a 401K class action suite against Enron, how will that affect my severance if I am involuntarily terminated? Related Q. If I am involuntarily terminated and required to sign a waiver as part of the severance package, can I participate in an employee or shareholder class action suite against Enron.
