Subject: RE: Congratulations
Thanks of your words of encouragement. -----Original Message----- From: Lee, Dennis Sent: Friday, March 22, 2002 1:06 PM To: Corman, Shelley Subject: Congratulations Let me point out, this is NOT sucking up. However, congratulations on your new endeavor. I know it's too early to consider, but in the future, if you decide there is a position available in your new group, please consider me. Don't get me wrong, I'm not unhappy where I am, just seeking opportunities to expand. I bring 28 years experience in a variety of areas both in TW and NNG including Contracts, Scheduling, and Gas Control. Again congratulations and good luck. Dennis
