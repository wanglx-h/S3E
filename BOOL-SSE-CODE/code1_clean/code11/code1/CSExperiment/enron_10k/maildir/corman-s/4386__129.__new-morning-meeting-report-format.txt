Subject: New Morning Meeting Report Format
Jo, Kent & Dave, Per our joint meeting in Omaha several weeks ago and subsequent conversations with Jo and others, the morning meeting report has been revised to: - Remove unnecessary line pack and yesterday's plan info. - Add additional interconnect points - Add fuel and a system balance computation for the Market, Midcontinent and Permian area - Improve formatting and readability. Dale will shortly forward a draft of the new report. Please confirm that it meets with your expectations. We would plan to put this new format in place mid-week next week.
