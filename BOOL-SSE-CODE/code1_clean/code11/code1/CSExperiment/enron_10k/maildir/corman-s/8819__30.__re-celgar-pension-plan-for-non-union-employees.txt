We have received materials concerning the pension plan for non-union employees at Celgar. The company's latest actuarial report disclosed that as of January 1, 2000: ? 1. The going-concern liabilities exceeded the actuarial value of assets by? C$1,922,342; and ? 2.? The solvency liabilities exceeds the market value of plan assets by? C$1,805,819. ? We have also received the full text of the plan and its amendments. ? Will you be reviewing these matters internally or shall we retain a local actuarial firm to perform the due diligence?
