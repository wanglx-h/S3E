Subject: RE: Possibily of Delaying/Postponing Tomorrow's Party
I have heard back from Danny and he wants us to cancel the event. Get whatever money back you can & see if we can forgo any other current payments by postponing the event until next year, rather than canceling. -----Original Message----- From: Sawyer, Lisa Sent: Wednesday, November 28, 2001 11:48 AM To: Corman, Shelley; Carrillo, Alma Cc: Holmes, Bradley; January, Steve; Nacey, Sheila; Scott, Donna; Bryant, Mike; Blair, Lynn Subject: RE: Possibily of Delaying/Postponing Tomorrow's Party Shelly, I am obligated to pay the full $2850 to the Casino company. I have not actually paid, but per the agreement that is what I would owe. -----Original Message----- From: Corman, Shelley Sent: Wednesday, November 28, 2001 11:12 AM To: Carrillo, Alma; Sawyer, Lisa Cc: Holmes, Bradley; January, Steve; Nacey, Sheila; Scott, Donna; Bryant, Mike; Blair, Lynn Subject: Possibily of Delaying/Postponing Tomorrow's Party Alma/Lisa, I need to know what the ramifications are of canceling/postponing tomorrow's party. What will lose? What have we not paid back?
