Subject: Re: Real-Time Position Opening
Bill I have a freind that just graduated from Oregon State with a business degree i think his emphasis was MIS and finance. He is a pretty bright kid and wants to pursue a carrer in finance. I actually talked to him about it at some length about Enron on New Years Day and he seemed very interested. . He is a friend of mine from my fraternity and a really good guy who I think would fit in well here if given the opportunity. I dont know about your feelings on hiring guys right out of college. I know we had done so in the past but I wasn't really sure about your feelings on that. Let me know.
