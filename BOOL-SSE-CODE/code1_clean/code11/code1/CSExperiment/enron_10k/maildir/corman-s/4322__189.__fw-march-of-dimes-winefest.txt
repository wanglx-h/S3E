Enron's 2001 WalkAmerica campaign was the #14 Walk Team in Houston, contributing $72,563 to the March of Dimes. In addition, Danny McCarty was the #2 fundraiser in the city, raising $20,350, and Sophie Patel was the #5 fundraiser, raising $10,002. In appreciation of all your efforts for WalkAmerica and the March of Dimes, you and a guest are invited to the 2001 March of Dimes' WineFest on Thursday, October 4 from 6:00 p.m. - 9:00 p.m. at the Crystal Ballroom of the Rice Hotel. It will be a great evening of food, wine, friends, and a silent auction. Please let me know by Friday, September 28, if you will be able to attend WineFest 2001. Thank you, again, and hope to see you there.
