Subject: Letter(s) to RWE re Solicitation of Employees
Janette: At Michelle Cash's request, I have prepared the attached letters for the CEO and two managing directors of RWE Trading. We have set the letters up to go to both the Germany and United Kingdom addresses. We are still working on an address and name for the General Counsel. Since their London office is closed for the day, it will probably be Thursday morning before I get those details. Please call me if you need additional information. Thanks.
