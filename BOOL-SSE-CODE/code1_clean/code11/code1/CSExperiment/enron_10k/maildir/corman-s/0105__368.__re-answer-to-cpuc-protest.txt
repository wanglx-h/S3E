Subject: RE: answer to cpuc protest
I think we could wind this up with a quick conference call tomorrow a.m. Greg and I had some additional thoughts on how to handle the issue that this contract is not for 40% of primary capacity - it is not like an El Paso/Dynegy, Enron or El Paso deal without necessarily getting into the alternate issue of sham transactions. Also, Kathy R. checked and as of today, IS have not filed a protest.
