Subject: APS Tranny
Unlike other transmission providers, when we buy transmission from APS, the Start Time and End Time are both HOUR ENDING. According to them, they are "the leaders of the pack." So, if we want to purchase tranny for HE 14 FC to PV (like I did today), both the start time and end time would be 14:00. Make sure that you have the right time zone as well. Cheers Jesse
