thanks for organizing this! It was a blast. See you Sunday. Michelle Deannenoel@aol.com on 12/08/2000 10:02:58 AM To: michelle.cash@enron.com, Lisa.Anouilh@solvay.com (Anouilh,Lisa), Michelle.Blaine@enron.com (Michelle Blaine), mthamm@wt.net (Mary Thamm), rank@mdjlaw.com, sgussett@bracepatt.com (Sheryl Gussett) cc: Subject: Pregos at 7:30p.m. I am sorry to have left the details for so late, but here they are. Pregos at 7:30. Unfortunately, Elizabeth cannot make it, Lisa will be flying in from NYC so who knows when or if she will be there, and Deb has another engagement, but will meet us for drinks before dinner, so be prompt. The rest of us will have a fabulous time eating and DRINKING and trying not to cause a scene. See ya'll tonight.
