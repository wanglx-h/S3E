Michelle: We'd appreciate it if you will review the document and write the appropriate legal disclaimer that should be placed on the bottom of the document. Chris: The document includes the revisions we talked about. Also, the 2nd page of the 1st worksheet includes all the add'l cash comp to include (by codes). Pam: This is the document Robert shared with you. Do you foresee any problem with the data to be reflected in the document?
