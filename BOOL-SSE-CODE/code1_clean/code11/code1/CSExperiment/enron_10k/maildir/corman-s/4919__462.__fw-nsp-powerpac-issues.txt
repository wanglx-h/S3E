-----Original Message----- From: Threet, Kay Sent: Thursday, June 28, 2001 11:08 AM To: Blair, Lynn Cc: Stevens, Bob; Neville, Sue; Cabrera, Reyna Subject: NSP PowerPac Issues Lynn, Following our discussion yesterday afternoon, Reyna and I came back and reviewed the NSP powerpac agreement. We were specifically looking for language in this agreement which may require us to true up for the customer regardless of whether or not we were allocating storage on a given gas day. We couldn't put our finger on any language in the current agreement (dated April 1, 2001) that requires us to true up for them, but perhaps we overlooked or misinterpreted something. We would appreciate guidance from you or Bob using your interpretation of the agreement with regard to the following issues: According to the current agreement, what are our obligations to true up for the shipper a) if we have allocated storage for a given gas day? and b) if the shipper fails to enter a nom for a given gas day? Also, by what time is the true up required to be made? We would also like to clarify these same sort of issues for the Great River Energy powerpac, just to be certain that we are all in agreement as to how they are handled. I'm anticipating that we may have future deals of this nature, so anything we can do to alleviate confusion in future agreements would be beneficial. Thanks for your help! Kay
