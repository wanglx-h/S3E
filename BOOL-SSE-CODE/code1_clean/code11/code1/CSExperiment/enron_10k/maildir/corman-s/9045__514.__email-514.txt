Hey Jim. How is everything going? Things have been kind of interesting around here lately as Enron is probably going to file for bankruptcy or renegotiate the merger deal it is working on with Dynegy. I'm not sure what it all means for me so I just take each day at a time. I was searching through the internet (in my off-work time of course) and noticed that the price of YSR50s has really gone up. Do you still have yours? The price of one like yours is probably $2500 to $3000 now. Jeanie mentioned that you might come down here after Christmas. Let me know what your plans are. Maybe Jeanie can get her act together and come down for at least one day also. She messed around so much over Thanksgiving that she ended up getting here on Saturday at 4pm and left Sunday moring at 11am. The kids were pretty disappointed since Jeanie had said they would be here for Thanksgiving. Oh well. Hope everything is going well. Catch you later. Steve
