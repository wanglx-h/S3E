Subject: RE:
I hate to keep bugging you, but I wondered if you had a readout of Bonnie's investigation? It is not getting better here with Jonathan. I called his agency to alert them to some of the issues we discussed (i.e. taking long breaks and leaving the office for appointments outside of his job). I suspect they have spoken to him because now we are getting emails every time he leaves his desk and every time he returns. I would, more than anything, like to replace him before we get into the thick of the PRC process, and I am anxious to know what the outcome of the inquiry is so that I may consider options. Thanks in advance, Gina Sent: Friday, October 26, 2001 4:55 PM To: Corteselli, Gina Cc: Cash, Michelle Subject: Valeria returned my call and informed me that Bonnie Castellano is working with Jonathan Lane. Bonnie is out until Monday; I will speak with her then. --Lizzette
