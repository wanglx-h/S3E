Subject: SLA REFUND - IMPORTANT MESSAGE
I would like for both teams to review coverage for the the time period of March 18 - March 26th. That is the crunch time for getting all the information reviewed for the SLA Refund. It is critical that we have enough people available to review all the necessary reports as well as keep the day to day business going. I would like a person on each team to be designated as the point person for Raetta and Larry as well as the team to be sure all the bases are covered. That person needs to be working the whole time from 18th through 26th. (We will get the weekend off!!) Please let me know by Tuesday, March 11, who your point person is and if you have sufficient coveragefor Gas Logistics to be successful on the effort. Thanks. Lynn
