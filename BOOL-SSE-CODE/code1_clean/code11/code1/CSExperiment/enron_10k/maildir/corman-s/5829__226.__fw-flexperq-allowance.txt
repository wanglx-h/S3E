Subject: FW: Flexperq Allowance
I'm forwarding this so you know what is going on when there is a $181.17 deduct from my 12/31 paycheck. -----Original Message----- From: Executive Compensation Sent: Tuesday, December 11, 2001 8:15 AM To: Corman, Shelley Subject: Flexperq Allowance Due to the Bankruptcy Filing on December 2, 2001, a decision was made to discontinue the flexperq allowance. This decision was made after the December 14 payroll run. You will receive your allowance of $181.17 on your December 14 paycheck; however, Payroll will reduce your 12/31 paycheck for the same amount. Also, please note that executive physicals will no longer be offered or related expenses covered by Enron. Thank you!
