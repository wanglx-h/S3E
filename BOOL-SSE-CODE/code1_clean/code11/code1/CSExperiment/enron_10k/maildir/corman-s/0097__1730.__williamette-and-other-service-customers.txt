Subject: Williamette and other Service Customers
When taking Williamette to load, make sure that we now enter the purchase side in Enpower as follows: ST Hrly Williamette Fixed Forward (5.84) for the fixed price. There is no place to put an offset in a fixed deal. This replaces the index forward purchase with offset type deals that we have entered in Enpower ( the offset was to cover us for transmission reimbursement). The reason behind this is: Entering a deal as Williamette index less transport has been charging our desk the full index expense daily for this counterparty in Enpower. Since CAPS load is scheduled under Williamette, we had not been receiving any revenue for the Calimbalance piece. There may be other Service Counterparties that need to be adjusted. This may be confusing to you, as you all have been putting all Enpower under ST W Hrly. This much is good. Just make sure that from now on, any Service deal going to Real Time gets zero fixed price (unless you have to account for transmission). This keeps expense out of the ST W Hrly book. Once Volume Management allocates California revenue for Williamette, they speak with Services. Services provides the profitability calculation. An annuity is created, paying these counterparties an appropriate amount. Do you have questions?? There will be a cleanup for Sept, October and November. Thanks, JMF
