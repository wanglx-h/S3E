Subject: Network Update
As most of you know we have been experiencing some problems with our Network. Tonight starting at 7:30 Cisco doing some troubleshooting with our Networking team in Houston. I have co-ordinated the outages with the Real Time Schedulers. Please feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns. Thanks, Diana
