Subject: March
3/14 I found the 142 mw discrepancy. Fixed it too. But I'm still off with you. Your sales and purchases don't match by 2 mw>??? I agree wtih 4326 total mwh's Purchases: $895776.78 Sales: $ 890921.78 3/22 The 35 mw is actually 36 and you are right its the loss rtn, but we return those to you @ zero cost and should not be included in our totals. Purchases: 2537 MW $ 915,712.31 - we check here Sales: 2537 MW $911,055.41 Is this all we have wrong with March? If so, YEE HAW! ds
