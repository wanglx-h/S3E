Subject: RE: SBA Contracts
I am not sure I understand the question. Do you mean at anytime we call on SBA volumes, we never/should not allocate the location? -----Original Message----- From: Winckowski, Michele Sent: Wednesday, November 14, 2001 1:32 PM To: Bodnar, Michael; Blair, Lynn Cc: Cabrera, Reyna; Medeles, Gerry Subject: RE: SBA Contracts I guess the question is - have we ever actually reviewed when we call on the SBA volumes and what the system conditions have been during those periods. We want to verify that we are not allocating a point when we have SBA gas flowing. Theatrically, we argue that we would not call on SBAs if the gas was not needed to meet system requirements. We' want to verify that the theory and the actual match up. I hope this makes sense.

The changes in the business requirements for the scheduling priority of SBA contracts will not impact NNG's primary firm shippers. What do you need to verify and support this fact? -----Original Message----- From: Winckowski, Michele Sent: Monday, November 12, 2001 2:53 PM To: Blair, Lynn; Bodnar, Michael Subject: SBA Contracts Contract Shippers Contract Date 107018 Tenaska Marketing Ventures Nov 1 2000 107019 Texaco Gas Marketing Nov 1 2000 107021 OGE Energy Resources Nov 1 2000 107989 Tenaska Marketing Jun 1 2001 108021 Arkla Energy Marketing Co.
