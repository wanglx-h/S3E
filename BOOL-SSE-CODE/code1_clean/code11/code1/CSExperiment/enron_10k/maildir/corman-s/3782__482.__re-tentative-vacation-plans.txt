Ricki, are you planning on Ava covering for you next week when she gets back? Or is Alma covering for you? Thanks.

At this time, I don't know the actual flight time for tomorrow, but it could be as early as 3:30. I will be on vacation Monday , Tuesday and possibly Wednesday. I will send out a separate message to everyone once I have flight arrangements finalized. Sorry for being so evasive, but things are still in a state of turmoil for me. Thanks for understanding, Ricki
