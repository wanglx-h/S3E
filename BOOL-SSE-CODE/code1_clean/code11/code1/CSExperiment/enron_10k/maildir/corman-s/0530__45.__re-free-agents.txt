Also, this year if you forget to turn in bye week replacements (for K or Def) or replacements for players that are on a bye, you will have up til friday to make those pickups. WE ALL HAVE TO WORK SO I DON'T WANT TO GET PEOPLE BOTHERING ME IF YOU JUST HEARD SOME PLAYER BECAME AVAILABLE. To take advantage of this you have to need a bye week replacement or not be able to field a team because you have too many players on a bye (you don't have QB or only 2 WRs. If you have three WRs who can start but want another one because you don't like one of the ones that are able to start YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PICK UP ANY PLAYERS AFTER THE THURSDAY 1PM DEADLINE.

The free agent draft will be held Thursday at 1pm. You will have until 1pm to submit your free agent requests to me at mcuilla@enron.com. You should include who you want, who you want to drop and the amount of points you want to bid. You can bid 0 points for a free agent however if someone bids 1 point you will lose. In the case of a tying bid the two teams will have an open bid to determine who gets the player. Everyone will start with 100 points and you more points based on your weekly finish (1 point for highest score and 12 points for lowest score).
