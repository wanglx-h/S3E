Shirley, I have forwarded your message to John. Thanks.

I realized later that I was planning to comp next Tuesday because I am working this coming weekend. Possibly they might be short-staffed next week with it being Thanksgiving week. Could we schedule with them for the Tuesday after Thanksgiving? Thanks- Shirley
