Subject: E-TAG Survey
Bill, There's going to be a NERC E-Tag survey on Saturday 17th for HE 1400 PST. CA's will be reporting who is and who isn't in compliance. I received a call today to remind us of this from PGE transmission. Apparently, they have been noting, as practice who's in compliance and who isn't, and I guess our stats aren't looking good. We just need to make sure we submit tags for every transaction whether is on time or late. ds
