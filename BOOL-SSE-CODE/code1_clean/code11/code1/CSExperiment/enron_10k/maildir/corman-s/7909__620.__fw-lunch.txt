TW has a great marketing department and I know that you will enjoy working with everyone. Can we schedule lunch next week? I would love to visit with you and share with you some of the things we have been working on to ensure a smooth transition. I am available on Monday, Wednesday or Friday. Tuesday is possible, I would need to move another appointment. Thanks, Kim.
