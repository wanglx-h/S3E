Brad, there are six people leaving from the Houston area next Fri. am. What are your plans and when can you get away? I know you had such a wonderful time traveling with JSL & me that one year, I can't imagine that you would want to pass another opportunity like that again. The other people are Julio (brother), Dad, you, me, and my two nephews, Chase Laguarta and Cade Rhoden. Please let me know so we can try to keep from taking a 4 cars if possible. Kirk
