Subject: Quick Update
Jeff and Greg, Operationally, we are doing great, with tremendous press coverage (USA Today, CNN, Newsweek, Boston Globe, etc...), growing traffic, and lots of praise for our site and concept. On the business development front, we are now talking seriously with eBay about a distribution arrangement and with Northwest about expanding to their full route system. Meanwhile, we are running out of cash. The money we've got in the bank will last through early August (assuming an orderly shut-down). In order to keep our business development efforts alive, we're trying to raise $500k at a low valuation in the next 30 days. Would you be willing to consider a portion of this amount as a personal investment? Attached is an up-to-date overview of where we stand. Best, Frank Levy - Update 5_30_01 v2.ppt
