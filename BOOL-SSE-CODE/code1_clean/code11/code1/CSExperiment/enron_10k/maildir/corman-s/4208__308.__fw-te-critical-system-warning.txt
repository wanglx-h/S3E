Chris -----Original Message----- From: infopost@duke-energy.com [mailto:infopost@duke-energy.com] Sent: Tuesday, November 27, 2001 12:00 AM To: infopost@duke-energy.com Subject: TE Critical System Warning November 27, 2001 TEXAS EASTERN TRANSMISSION, LP (Texas Eastern) continues to operate under the Critical System Warning issued November 26, 2001. Based on anticipated system operations and weather conditions, as stated below, Texas Eastern is requiring that all customers take immediate and prompt steps to eliminate excess receipts and conform scheduled receipts to actual deliveries. This system-wide warning is issued as a result of actual receipts into the system significantly exceeding actual deliveries. This Critical System Warning shall remain in place until further notice. Weather in the market area continues to be unseasonably mild and shippers have been filling contract storage inventories in anticipation of the coming winter heating season. At this time, Texas Eastern's storage capacity is approximately 98% full. As a result, there is virtually no storage capacity or line pack available for system operational purposes and Texas Eastern cannot continue to absorb actual imbalances left on the system. Due to the critical nature of this situation, and the fact that Texas Eastern no longer has the ability to further absorb imbalances being left on the system, Texas Eastern requests that all customers coordinate with their suppliers the actual quantities received into the system match actual customer takes in the market area. No due pipe gas will be accepted into the system until further notice. If immediate action does not result in reducing the current volume of gas being left on the system, Texas Eastern may be forced to issue an operational flow order ("OFO") requiring actual receipts of gas to match actual deliveries out of the system, which will be subject to the OFO non-compliance penalty of $25 per dekatherm. In addition, and as provided for in Texas Eastern's FERC Gas Tariff, Texas Eastern will take any other actions as may be necessary to protect the integrity of its system, including, but not limited to, suspension of OBA's. ******************************************************************* NOTE: Duke Energy Gas Transmission respects your online time and privacy.
