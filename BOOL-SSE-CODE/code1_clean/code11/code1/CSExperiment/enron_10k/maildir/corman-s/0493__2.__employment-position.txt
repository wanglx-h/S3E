Subject: Employment Position
Michelle, Lee Allbritton and I are friends. He suggested I contact you regarding the employment position you are seeking to fill. He explained that you are not using recruiters to fill this slot. I understand you have already seen several candidates but I would appreciate the opportunity to meet you and discuss the position. My resume is attached for your consideration. My firm is unaware that I am seeking other employment so I would respectfully request that you keep my interest in Enron confidential. I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you for your time.
