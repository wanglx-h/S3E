Tim, I just got your letter about the January trial setting. When did we learn of that setting? How do we accomplish the goal of keeping our business people free from depositions at year-end? Can that be done? Michelle "Tim C. Carrico" <tcarrico@spilmanlaw.com> on 11/03/2000 08:30:19 AM To: "Michelle Cash (E-mail)" <michelle.cash@enron.com> cc: "Charles L. Woody" <cwoody@spilmanlaw.com> Subject: Richard Clonch v. CRDC, Enron Michelle, I just spoke to Brian Glasser; he informed me that Clonch wants 1.2 mil, therefore, no settlement. However, Clonch and Cline have agreed to meet again this coming Monday to discuss settlement. Apparently, Clonch is going to go back and look at his numbers. Tim C.
