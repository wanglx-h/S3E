Subject: RE: Summary of NOI
I don't think that it is absolutely imperative to attend. However, we may be able to help Joe define some of the customer benefits of electronic service. Can one of the Tobys attend? -----Original Message----- From: Holmes, Bradley Sent: Friday, October 05, 2001 2:54 PM To: Corman, Shelley Subject: FW: Summary of NOI Shelley: Do you want me or someone in my group to participate in this proceeding? I don't see that the outcome will affect us directly but it might be interesting to understand the issues.

Essentially, FERC wants to expand service electronically to allow individuals to receive documents through email without the need for interventions just to be kept informed of the proceedings. FERC is making two proposals, one for service to parties and one for service to individuals for a cost (FERC states cost recovery but no specifics). Comments are due November 2. Joe has asked that I coordinate comments for our pipelines. Let me know who you wish to participate. << File: Summary-RM01-11.DOC >>
