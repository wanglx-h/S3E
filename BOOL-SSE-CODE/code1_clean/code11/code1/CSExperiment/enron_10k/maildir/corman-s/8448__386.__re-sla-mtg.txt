I guess we'll cancel the direct report meeting since this means that Lynn, Steve & Mike will be absent. -----Original Message----- From: Winters, Ricki Sent: Wednesday, January 16, 2002 7:00 AM To: Corman, Shelley Subject: SLA Mtg. Shelley, there is a meeting to discuss the SLA meeting today from 9:30 until 11:00 with Lynn, Steve, Mary Kay & Dave Neubauer. Will you be attending or do you want to continue with your direct report staff meeting? Thank you, Ricki
