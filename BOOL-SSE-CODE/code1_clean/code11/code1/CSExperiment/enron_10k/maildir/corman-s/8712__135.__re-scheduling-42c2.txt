Ava has willingly taken on this task. So she will be the point person going forward. Thanks.

Pilar and Linda are the marketing assistants on 42. Any other thoughts? -----Original Message----- From: Carrillo, Alma Sent: Wednesday, September 26, 2001 9:20 AM To: Dietz, Rick Subject: Scheduling 42C2 Rick, Since Maria Perales was the point person to schedule 42C2 and has since moved to 3AllenCenter, who will be the new contact person to schedule 42C2? This information is posted in the intranet (see link below). Market Services and Marketing assistants have access to it. Alma 36503 <http://home.enron.com:84/epco/EBCR.xls>
