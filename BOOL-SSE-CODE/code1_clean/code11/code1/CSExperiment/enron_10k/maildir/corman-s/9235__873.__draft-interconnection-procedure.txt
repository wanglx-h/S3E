Subject: Draft interconnection procedure
Mary - here is a draft of what the PGE interconnection procedure will be. As I said, much of this is from VEPCO and Carolina Power. Michele is redrafting it to be compatible with our OATT. Let me know your comments as we want to file with FERC this week. Thanks. Jay.
