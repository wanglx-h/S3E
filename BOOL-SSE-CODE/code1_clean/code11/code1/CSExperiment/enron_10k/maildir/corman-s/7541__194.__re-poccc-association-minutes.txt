Jonny is still there , and thank you for the mosquito machines. >>> Allen Crosswell 10/09/01 03:21PM >>> Is Johnny still down there? If not, I need to get some keys to my unit. Is there a master key? I have ordered the mosquito machines which run on propane gas and will need to be refilled every 4-6 weeks. I have two of them ordered to cover an area of 1.5 acres surrounding the pool.
