I am going to be the Senior Regulatory Counsel at ISO New England starting on April 9, 2001. My last day in the Portland area will be March 31, 2001. I enjoyed working with you and wish you the best of everything. I'm having a pot luck at my house Friday, if you and Steve want to come over. My new address will be: Mary Hain Senior Regulatory Counsel ISO New England Inc. One Sullivan Road Holyoke, MA 01040-2841 (413) 535-4000 mhain@ISO-NE.com
