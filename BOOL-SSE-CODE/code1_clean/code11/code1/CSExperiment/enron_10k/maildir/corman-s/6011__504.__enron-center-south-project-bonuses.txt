Subject: Enron Center South project Bonuses
Hi Greg, There are a small number of people in my group who were promissed a completion bonus on the new building. They were asked to work double time for much of the projcect by Skilling/Bibi and have, in my view, done a remarkable job. Can you let me know if we will be in a position to honour these bonuses? They amount to approx $200K in total. Regards Mark Pickering Chief Technology Officer Enron Net Works, LLC _____
