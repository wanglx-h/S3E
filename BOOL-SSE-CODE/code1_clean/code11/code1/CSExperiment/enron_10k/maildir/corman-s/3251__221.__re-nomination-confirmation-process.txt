Subject: RE: Nomination/Confirmation Process
Tom, we would be glad to do a timeline review. I will be out of town until next Wednesday. John, would you please give Tom a call and work with Ava to set up a time for us to review. Tom, did a "brown bag" session work for you guys from 11:30 to 1:00? If so, we can go that route again. Thanks.

Please let me know if we can get this lined up. Thanks, Tom Halpin Enron Transportation Services 402-398-7334 Tom.Halpin@enron.com
