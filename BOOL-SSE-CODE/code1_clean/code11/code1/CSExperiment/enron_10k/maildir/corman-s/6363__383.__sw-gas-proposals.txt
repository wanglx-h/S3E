Subject: SW Gas Proposals
Steve, While I am checking on this items we discussed, here is a draft copy of both proposals. Please note that I have given them 60 days to respond. That may be too long for the Red Rock proposal. Let me know if you would like one or both timeframes changed. I'll visit with you by voice mail as I get an answer from Dennis Tu. Thanks, Kim.
