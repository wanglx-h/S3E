Dear Real Timers, As I have been having to pull tapes lately, I cannot stress enough the importance of stating the hour for which you are trading when you make deals. It is imperative that you state (as often as possible) the hours that you are trading for, and it is extremely helpful when you re-cap the sale at the end of your trade!! :) please... There may be deals that we are going to loose the dispute for because neither trader (on either side) stated clearly what hour we were trading for. I'm relying on you guys to help me collect 100% on all our trades. Please see or e-mail me with any questions. Thanks. Virginia
