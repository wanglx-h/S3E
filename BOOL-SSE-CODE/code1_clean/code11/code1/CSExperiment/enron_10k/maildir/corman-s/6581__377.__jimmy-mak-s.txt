Subject: Jimmy Mak's
They are great, they actually play every tuesday and thursday at Jimmy Mak's. I would love to go and I will try to drum up some support for it here. We should probably get there before 9pm to secure good seats even though they start jamming around 9:30-45.

I have no idea if they are any good, but it may be fun. Want to get a group together and check it out? http://portland.citysearch.com/profile/11479609/ -sv
