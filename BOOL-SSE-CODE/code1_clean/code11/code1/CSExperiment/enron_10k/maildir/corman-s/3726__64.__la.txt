Hey Guz, I am going to be in LA May 26-29th. I know you are down there frequently, so if you happen to be going that weekend- Eric Brooker rented a beach house for the week to celebrate graduating from optometry school. He is throwing a party on the 26th. I'll get more info for you if you are going to be down that weekend. Take it easy, Ben
