Subject: november 25 board agenda item - retention
Greg, Please review with Ken Lay. We're going to put this on the Agenda for the 6pm (CST) Board meeting unless we hear otherwise from you. Dr. LeMaistre, Mary Joyce, Towers Perrin are all aware of the proposed retention plan. The urgency is coming from BU and Function leads. The current resolution gives delegation to Enron OTC for final sign-off and implementation in consultation with Towers Perrin. Call either David Oxley or me to discuss. Thanks, Aaron work - 713 853 9280 cell - 713 303 4633
