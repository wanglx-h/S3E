Subject: Hendricks v. Dynegy
Today, I worked with Robin Gibbs and Jeff Alexander on an Enron pleading in the captioned case. I asked if we had considered asking FERC Staff to file a "friend of the court" brief detailing how FERC has "occupied the field" of wholesale rate regulation. Was this or should this be considered?
