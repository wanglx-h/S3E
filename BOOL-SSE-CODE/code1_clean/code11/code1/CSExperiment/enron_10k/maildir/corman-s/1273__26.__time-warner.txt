Subject: time warner
I called time warner and basically we were on a 6 month trial package of hbo and showtime for 9.95. After 6 months, the rate goes to 12.95 - they charged us for hbo, showtime, and cinemax which should be 16.95 but they overcharged us in addition to the fact that we don't currently get cinemax. I went ahead and ordered the 3 channel package (with cinemax) and they are crediting us for 19.95 for the overcharge. Going forward the package will be 16.95 or we can cancel cinemax and save 4.00 a month.
