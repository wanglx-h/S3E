Subject: Signing bonus/raise
When does the cash portion of my signing bonus get paid. I thought it was the first pay period after it was signed but maybe I am confused. Also, since the raise was effective starting Sept. 1, will they issue a separate check for the difference between the base salary? Thanks, Martin Cuilla
