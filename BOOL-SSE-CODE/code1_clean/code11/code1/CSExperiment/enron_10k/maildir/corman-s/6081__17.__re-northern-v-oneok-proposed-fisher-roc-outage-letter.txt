If you could please get me telefaxes for both Delaine Kurth and Kim Hardeman, as well as an address for Kim Hardeman(or whoever has taken her place), I would appreciate it. (Lynn, thanks for the suggestion on the names). Britt P.S. to everyone else: Does everyone agree we need to send the proposed Fisher Roc outage letter to Delaine and Kim? Is there anyone else we need to include on the ONEOK side?
