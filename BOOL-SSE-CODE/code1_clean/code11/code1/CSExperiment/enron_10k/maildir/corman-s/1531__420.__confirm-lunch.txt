Subject: Confirm Lunch
Sorry I missed you today. Looking forward to lunch tomorrow. Will 11:45 at La Grilia suit you? Have fun at your event tonight. Also - mea culpa. I just replaced my daytimer calendar for 2002 and realized that I missed Matt's birthday. I hope that wasn't the day we were all over at your house. Oops. Wish Matt a belated greeting on us and of course congrats on his promotion. See you tomorrow.
