Subject: Cost Savings Memo
Attached for your information is a memo that we plan to send out to employees worldwide Monday afternoon or Tuesday morning discussing the Policy Committee's cost saving recommendations. To the extent there are unique aspects of these policies as they apply to your business unit, please follow up with a further communication to your employees. We will send you a list of frequently asked questions that deal with systems issues. Thank you. Karen
