Subject: Promotion
It hasn't been announced yet, but to keep you informed, I have been promoted to Director effective 02/01. I received the official word this morning. Apparently a memo will go out shortly with several promotions listed. There aren't any planned organizational changes, just a title change. Thank you for all of your support. I've always enjoyed working in and around Gas Control and hope to continue to do so in the future. Gary
