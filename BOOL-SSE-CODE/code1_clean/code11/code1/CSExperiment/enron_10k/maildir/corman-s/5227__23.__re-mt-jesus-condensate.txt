Subject: RE: Mt. Jesus Condensate
Charlie, let me try calling Delaine in the morning and ask her who is next in the chain of command I should visit with on this issue. Let's see what kind of a response I get. If that does not work, then Mike or Shelley may need to call. I will let you know. Thanks.

Jesus Condensate Lynn, Do you want to contact Delaine or should I. In light of Stan & Dave Neubauer's, "get disputes on the table and settled quickly" direction I believe we need to bump this up a notch! Should Mike Nelson or Shelly Corman call/write Greg Phillips?

Jesus Condensate I never heard anything from Oneok on pulling a sample at Mt. Jesus, no one from Oneok or from a consulting firm ever called. Have you heard anything?
