Subject: Storage Question
Shelley, I talked with Kent Miller and he confirmed that the Storage group sends storage volumes to EIA for reporting purposes. They do NOT send anything to AGA. But it is his understanding that AGA is getting their information from EIA so by default he believes that AGA gets NNG's storage numbers. As a reminder this question came up in the staff meeting this week and I was to follow up with Kent. If you have any questions, please let me know. Thanks. Lynn
