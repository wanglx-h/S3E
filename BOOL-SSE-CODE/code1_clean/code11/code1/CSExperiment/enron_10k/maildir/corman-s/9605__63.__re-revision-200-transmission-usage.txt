I didn't separate the PGE data, only BPA by your request. If you need me to do so please let me know. ds -----Original Message----- From: Comnes, Alan Sent: Monday, September 10, 2001 5:03 PM To: Scholtes, Diana Subject: RE: REVISION 200 TRANSMISSION USAGE Diana: Looks great. I have a follow up questions: It looks like you parsed PGE data into the 4 buckets (Network-ST , Network LT, IT ST, IT LT). Is that true (i.e. 100% of our PGE usage is IT LT) or would disaggregating our usage on PGE require more work?
