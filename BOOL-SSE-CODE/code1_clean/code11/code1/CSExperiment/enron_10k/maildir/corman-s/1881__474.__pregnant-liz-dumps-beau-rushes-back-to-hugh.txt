Subject: Pregnant Liz Dumps Beau -- & Rushes Back To Hugh
[IMAGE] [IMAGE] [IMAGE] [IMAGE]PREGNANT LIZ DUMPS BEAU -- & RUSHES BACK TO HUGH [IMAGE]WILL WEDDING BELLS BE NEXT? [IMAGE] [IMAGE] A radiant Liz, seen here in London, puts the tears of her breakup with boyfriend Steve Bing behind her Pregnant Liz Hurley broke down in tears and dumped boyfriend Steve Bing after he told her he didn't want to become a dad. Then she flew back to Britain to be comforted by former lover Hugh Grant - who's now trying to woo her back! That's the tangled tale behind the headlines as Liz's roller-coaster relationship with Grant takes another incredible turn. Now close pals are predicting the glamour couple will tie the knot - and Hugh will adopt Liz's baby! "Hugh's already acting like it's his child," revealed a source close to the couple. "Bing didn't want the baby - so why not?" Said an insider: "Hugh never wanted to lose Liz - she was the one who dumped him after he was caught with a hooker in Hollywood. "But he's always been there for her - now more than ever. [IMAGE] A pensive Hugh leaves Liz's London home, where he and Liz are staying together. "He was the one who went with her and held her hand when she had her first ultrasound. They're both living under the same roof at Liz's house in London while Hugh's apartment is remodeled. "He's doing all he can to win her back - and it wouldn't surprise any of their pals if they get married and Hugh adopts the baby! "When Liz discovered she was expecting Bing's baby, she never considered an abortion. She always wanted a baby and she realizes that at age 36 her biological clock is ticking. "And when she looks at other famous moms like Madonna, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Kate Winslet, she realizes she can have a career AND a baby." Bing, $600 million real estate heir and wanna-be Hollywood producer, wooed Liz over private dinners at the $3,000-a-night suite he keeps at the posh Hotel Bel-Air in Los Angeles. But close pals say Bing's negative reaction to Liz's pregnancy stunned the supermodel and killed their romance for good. Now she's dubbed the 37-year-old playboy "Bing Laden"!

In an evaluation hearing in California, Robert Downey Jr. told the judge that his focus right now in life is his recovery and his family. "Furthering my endeavor in recovery ? is really my priority for right now," Downey told Riverside County Superior Court Judge Randall D. White. "I've been able to re-establish contact with my family. That's the only privilege I consider myself really to have at this point." Downey was sentenced to one year at a live-in rehab facility and three years of probation last year after pleading no contest to a charge of cocaine possession and being under the influence. "With some humility I'd like to let the court know I appreciate your allowing me to continue," Downey told Judge White. Although Downey did not speak to reporters, his attorney James Epstein revealed that Downey has turned down many offers for acting jobs since he has been in treatment. "You'll have Robert again, I promise, on the screen. But for now, he's focusing on his personal life," said Epstein. Downey is scheduled for another evaluation hearing in March of 2002.
