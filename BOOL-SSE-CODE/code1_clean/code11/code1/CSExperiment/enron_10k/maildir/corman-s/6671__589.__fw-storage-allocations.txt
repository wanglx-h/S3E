For the weekend, we want to schedule maximum storage withdrawals (to protect against zone allocations) and we want to "schedule" the firm right to reduce our withdrawal to zero in the final nomination cycle. We expect NNG to honor our FIRM MAX RATE storage contract rights before they schedule a single dth of interruptible storage. Please confirm our firm rights for all 3 of our Alliant Energy Utilities. We would like this confirmation by 3:00pm this afternoon in order to properly notify our customers of any necessary constraints.
