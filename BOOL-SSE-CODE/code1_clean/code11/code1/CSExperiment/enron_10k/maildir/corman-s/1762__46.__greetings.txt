Subject: Greetings
Hi Mom, Chad just loves his apple checkboard. Thanks again for it. I am still feeling sick. Last week my Dr. told me its just allergies/asthma, but I'm still feeling puny. I trying to get in to see if I have a touch of bronchitis or something. I'm going to forward this little list while I'm thinking of it. Ordinarily, I'm not one of those people that believes in giving people a gift wish list. It seems kind of rude and presumptious. However, given that we may be traveling in the November-December time frame and unable to field the normal questions I receive about what Mr. Chad is into -- I thought I'd provide this list: Things Chad Says He Wants for Christmas (That Santa isn't bringing) if anyone asks -- not he should expect to get these items (since some cost more than $20) -Harry Potter Game for Computer (MS-Windows) (more expensive item) -Backyard Football Game for Computer (MS-Windows) -Harry Potter Trading Cards -Video or DVD of "Cats and Dogs" -Harry Potter Snapes Potion Kit (More expensive item) -Ultra Grip Nerf Football Incidentally, Chad is asking Santa for the Harry Potter Legos Set, a Levitating Game and an Air Snare Drum Game. More Later Shelley
