Subject: IMPORTANT - Letter to Sierra re trans and interX for Project
 Priscilla
Attached find a letter to Sierra Pacific about our transmission and interconnection requests. Due to Nevada Power's dilatory tactics to date and the pendancy of financing for the project, Ed, Don, Stan, Jim G., and I agree that the letter takes the necessary tone and should ask Sierra to file with FERC the agreements (unexecuted) if Sierra doesn't give EPMI an executable contracts by 2/28/01. If we are going to make this demand we need to send this letter ASAP.
