Subject: WP-02 Data Response
request_number: PG-BPA: 134 firstname: Sarah lastname: Westenberg e-mail: sawestenberg@bpa.gov exhibit_wp-02-e-: BPA-77 page_numbers: Attachment A, pages 14-15 request_text: Please state and explain the rationale for the proposal to use revenues to effectively allocate net augmentation costs between Slice and non-Slice rates, rather than (a) the approach used to reflect other BPA costs in the calculation of the Slice Rate, which was determined in BPA's Record of Decision published in May 2000, or (b) the approach to this issue proposed by BPA in the December 2000 Amended Proposal." response_text: First, regarding the specific requests contained in this data request, neither the ROD in May 2000 nor the December 2000 Amended Proposal contained a methodology to adjust both Slice and non-Slice power rates multiple times each year during the rate period for changes in BPA,s augmentation costs. In fact, the issue now is not a Slice vs. non-Slice issue. Rather, it is an issue of which power products subject to LB CRAC recover what amount of the additional net augmentation costs. The approaches to recovering net augmentation costs in May ROD and December 2000 Amended Proposal are different than that proposed in the Supplemental Proposal. It simply is not possible to explain some distinction that is alleged to be introduced in this Supplemental Proposal when neither the May 2000 or December 2000 proposals contained no method for calculating and then apportioning these costs in one way between individual power products. No such segmentation was required in either of those two prior proposals. In the May ROD, there was only one CRAC, which allocated the amount of revenues to be raised by non-Slicer power products based on revenues (WP-02-FS-BPA-02A, p. 283). However, that one CRAC did not attempt to collect BPA,s net augmentation costs as the currently proposed LB CRAC attempted to do. In the December Amended Proposal, BPA proposed two very different methods for collecting net augmentation costs from customers. Slice share of augmentation costs was determined based on share of the FBS. Non-Slice power products, share of net augmentation costs was determined using loads. Together, these two approaches collected more than 100% of BPA,s net augmentation costs. So, the Supplemental Proposal contains a new methodology to recover net augmentation costs using twice-annual rate adjustments to all power products subject to LB CRAC. This new approach required a new methodology, and, as a result, this new methodology cannot be directly compared to methodologies in the earlier proposals. Second, turning to the broader question of the justification for using revenues, there are several reasons why BPA considers this to be the correct approach. The first policy objective driving the Amended Proposal and Supplemental Proposal is that &It should be as simple as possible.8 (WP-02-E-BPA-70, pg. 6, line 4). One principle underlying settlement discussions was that the LB CRAC method ought to assure that each power product subject to the LB CRAC is charged with recovering the same percentage increase in revenue. The approach to determining the equal percentage increases in revenue required from each power product subject to LB CRAC is to use revenues in the determination of the LB CRAC%. In this calculation, net augmentation cost are spread across the sum of all expected revenues from all power products subject to LB CRAC for the entire 6-month duration of the LB CRAC. The resulting percentage, referred to as LB CRAC%, is then applied equally to each power product subject to the LB CRAC. This approach assures that each separate power product, subject to the LB CRAC, will then have a revised rate that is determined using the same percentage increase in required revenue. Additionally, the problem BPA is grappling with is one of sufficient revenues. Net augmentation costs are expressed in dollars. Revenues from power products without the LB CRAC is expressed in dollars. By spreading the former dollars over the latter dollars, and applying the resulting percentage to revenues without the LB CRAC, results in incremental dollars required from each separate power product that is subject to the LB CRAC. This appears to BPA to be a very fair and equitable approach to recover net augmentation costs. The following information is from the web server: 1. Logon: IUSR_GRANITE 2.
