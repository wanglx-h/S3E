Subject: Check Instructions & Delivery
Joceyln, I've had a change in my schedule today and I won't drop off the check in person. I deposited the Enron check in my bank account this am on my way to work (to make sure I get the cash before any bankruptcy filing) and will have a personal check couriered over to your office. Unless you instruct otherwise, I will make the check out to Salomon Smith Barney and put the caption FBO Shelley Corman in the Memo line of check. Let me know if an account number should appear on the check. Thanks
