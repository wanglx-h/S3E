Subject: RE: Sale to Louisiana-Pacific (L-P)
In a confirmation letter dated September 27, 2000 we did a five year fixed price deal with LP and, in the confirm, we amended the credit terms of the underlying Enron Master Agreement. In the confirmation letter we use to document this current deal, we need to make sure: (i) Credit is ok with the new deal being done under the same old credit terms; and (ii) that the new confirm refer to the credit amendments in the old confirm. Melissa and Sharon, please make sure Credit is ok with the old credit amendments for the new deal and then send me the draft confirm and I will make sure it refers to the old confirm correctly. ----cgy -----Original Message----- From: Malowney, John Sent: Friday, June 08, 2001 4:20 PM To: Swerzbin, Mike; Dunton, Heather; Yoder, Christian Cc: Radous, Paul; Semperger, Cara; Scholtes, Diana; Murphy, Melissa Ann; Cason, Sharen Subject: Sale to Louisiana-Pacific (L-P) The attached details a sale done late Friday (6/8/01) afternoon to L-P that needs to be entered into the Trade log.
