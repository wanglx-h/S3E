Subject: Conference Call with PG&E to Discuss the Gas Portion of Its
 Proposed Plan of Reorganization that It Will File w/FERC Toward End of
 November
PG&E called. They want to set up a conference call to brief us on the gas piece of their POR that they'll be filing with FERC around November 30th. They want to try to do it in the next couple of weeks. Please let me know if you're interested and please pass this along to anyone else who might be interested. Thanks. Best, Jeff
