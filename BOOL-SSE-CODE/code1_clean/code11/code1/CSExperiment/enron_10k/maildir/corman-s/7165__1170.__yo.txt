Hey chica que pasa? I am bored and its 2 in the freaking morning and I am sick and this really sucks. Anyway this wasn't a mail to complain. I wanted to know if you were still having your party on Saturday, if I was still invited, if I could bring anything, and how to get to your house. Well hope your day goes well. One more night shift to go and then 5 days off for me!
