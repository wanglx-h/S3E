Shelley, here are the four PAA's for the people who tested the flowing gas. This does not include Larry or Legale. Brad, Rick and I are discussing how to handle these two. The attached PAA's are for Kathy Sturr, Diana Porter, Renee Perry and Jean Adams. If you have any questions, please let me know. Thanks. Lynn
