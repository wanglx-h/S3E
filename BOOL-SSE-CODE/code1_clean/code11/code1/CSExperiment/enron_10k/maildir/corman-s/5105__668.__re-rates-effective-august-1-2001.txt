Subject: RE: Rates Effective August 1, 2001
I definitely think we should let customers know as needed basis. Someone should certainly talk to ENA. Terry, please work with Jean on this. John and Terry, are there other customers who download our rates? Thanks.

ENA loads our rates into their system. They should probably know if they need to re-load them for September 1. What do you think? Jean
