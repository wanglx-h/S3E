Subject: Holiday
I'm planning on heading out the office around 3 PM or so. Feel free to send home staff as business needs permit. I'm not planning on sending out any kind of notice to all Gas Logistics -- as I feel like it is frustrating to those that must stay. Have a safe and happy holiday. I'll be in Austin tomorrow & Friday, so call me on my cell (713-857-2103) or email me if you need me. In case of emergency, I can be reached at my brother-in-law's house in Austin at 512-474-5631.
