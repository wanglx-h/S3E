Subject: Re: hi!
I am doing pretty good. I have been really busy lately. And the work situation should be resolved sometime next week as I am interviewing for two other internal positions on the trading desk. Family is okay I guess. Dad is not doing well at all and was almost checked into the hospital yesterday. Angela is really really worried about him and we talk just about everyday. I am in the process of getting the documents for power of attorney in case anything happens to him and he is incapacitated or something. I had a very interesting weekend last weekend. Just a whole bunch of crazy shit happened. It was all fun stuff though. How about you?
