Subject: Measurement TBS/End User Problems
Per my conversation with Chris this morning, she wanted me to pass this information on regarding some of the things that we have found that have to do with our TBS/End User problem. We have some end user daily volumes that are more than the physical daily volume at their related TBS (which also may have to do with the problem that we have with 16 and 31 day charts not being read) - when that happens we end up overbilling the LDC. The ones that we are having a problem with are Wisconsin Power and Light and Wisconsin Gas. If you need any other details on this, please let me know or you can bring them up at our meeting on Monday. Thanks, Raetta
