Subject: Findings
Here's my first stab Key Findings 1. With only one significant exception, the groups acknowledge their tasks/responsibilities in the measurement process. The only area that appears to be lacking defined roles/responsibility is follow-through on open issues/corrections that are not made prior to close 2. The main issues with late data for billing relate to execution and lack of communication follow-through 3. There needs to be an added focus in the field about how their tasks relate to the NNG billing process. Current procedures are written solely in the context of calculating UAF. 4. The customers chart changing arrangements raise audit concerns and concerns about our ability to gather timely data for billing. Recommendations 1. Educate field and GMS staff on use of measurement data in billing -- combination of written materials and presentations (Gas Logistics). 2. Renegotiate chart changing agreements/gain understanding of timing parameters. 3. Assign responsibility for past month issues past measurement close. 4. Develop single point of organizational accountability for quality/timeliness of data fed into PGAS, including Field Teams with respect to their measurement duties; measurement technology, GMS and UAF specialist.
