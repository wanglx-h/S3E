Subject: Rating Agency Material Meeting Last Friday
Kevin, I want to apoligize for not attending the meeting last week. For some reason it didn't go on to my calendar and also I was not feeling well so I left work early. If there is anything else I can do to help out just let me know. Thanks. Steve
