Subject: FW: Northern TPAs
Greg, Typically I sign all these EDI trading partner agreements with Lee Huber's initials. Can we get the proper agency/delegations in place so that I can continue to sign without further ado so long as the agreements are identical to the GISB standard agreement. We can put in place a separate procedure for any non-standard TPAs? -----Original Message----- From: Draemer, Mary Sent: Wednesday, February 13, 2002 9:47 AM To: Corman, Shelley Subject: Northern TPAs Shelley, Will you be able to continue executing the Northern Natural Gas Company TPAs? If not, can you tell me who will so that I can update the TPA on the website. Thanks, Mary
