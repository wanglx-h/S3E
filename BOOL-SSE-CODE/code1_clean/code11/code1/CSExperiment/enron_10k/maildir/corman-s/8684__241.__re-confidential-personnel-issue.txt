I've got a call into Valeria. --Lizzette -----Original Message----- From: Cash, Michelle Sent: Friday, October 26, 2001 10:59 AM To: Corteselli, Gina; Palmer, Lizzette Subject: Re: CONFIDENTIAL Personnel issue I don't know if he went to Valeria. Lizzette, why don't you call her to find out status. I still think that termination this quickly after he raised discrim claims is a bit risky but if he is not doing his job then I think we should document it well and communicate with his agency to have it tell him that he must be there.
