Subject: RE: Priority of signing ISO-NE, NYISO, and PJM Transmission Tariffs
This sounds correct, but we are in the process of calling the pools to obtain the documentation necessary now and I would think that you may as well execute the transmission agreements at the same time, since the transmission agreements are typically the most standard and usually do not require collateral, etc. as long as they are ST firm or non-firm. -----Original Message----- From: Llodra, John Sent: Tuesday, January 08, 2002 7:57 AM To: Nicolay, Christi L. Cc: Davis, Mark Dana; Broderick, Paul J.; Benson, Robert; Gupta, Gautam; Wood, George; Meyn, Jim Subject: Priority of signing ISO-NE, NYISO, and PJM Transmission Tariffs Christi In preparing our business implementation plan, I am trying to identify and prioritize the relevant transmission agreements for each of the 3 northeast pools. My assumption is that, for pure internal transactions in each of the three pools, we do not really need to be a signatory to the respective ISO transmission agreements, and thus signing of these transmission agreements is not of the highest priority. Does this sound correct to you? My sense is that we only would need to sign on to the ISO transmission tariff to facilitate inter-pool transfers and/or to serve load in the regions. Does this sound correct to you? Please email or call me with any insights you might have. Regards John
