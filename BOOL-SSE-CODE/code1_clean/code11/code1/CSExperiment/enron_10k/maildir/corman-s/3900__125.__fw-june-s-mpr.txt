Sorry Richard, I forgot the attachments. -----Original Message----- From: Hannusch, Mary Sent: Monday, September 10, 2001 7:40 AM To: Ring, Richard Subject: June's MPR Richard, Attached are the reports for EES and EEMC. I have added the July's purchases we removed from last month's report. I am waiting to get EEMC's sales figures. Did you receive the BizMix and Fetzer reports from Annette Tafallo last month? I have left her several phone messages and she has not returned my call.
