The eThink Team is asking each Enron employee to submit one "Dream eSpeaker" suggestion for consideration to host an eSpeak session. Is there someone outside of Enron that you feel would have a valid audience inside Enron? Or, is there someone at Enron you think we have overlooked thus far? E-mail your eSpeak wish to ethink@enron.com.
