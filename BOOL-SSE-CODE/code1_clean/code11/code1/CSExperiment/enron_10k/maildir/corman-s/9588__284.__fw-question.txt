How are we answering this type of question? -----Original Message----- From: Becker, Melissa Sent: Wednesday, July 11, 2001 4:33 PM To: Cash, Michelle Subject: question I heard that we are to ask supervisors not to put a rating on the evaluation form. If they want to, is there any legal reason not to do it? I always thought the goal was to make the communication and documentation as accurate and explicit as possible. Thanks!
