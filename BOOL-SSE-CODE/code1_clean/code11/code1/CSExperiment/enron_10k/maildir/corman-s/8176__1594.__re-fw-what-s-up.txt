Subject: RE: FW: What's up?
Yeah, it's a long story but basically, he doesn't have a solid offer for me. But he has connections with some REO directors of some good companies like Advanta and he said he would give me great recommendations. He has already given my name and his recommendations to the REO director of Advanta and I guess that guy wants to talk to me. -----Original Message----- From: Mark.Guzman@enron.com [mailto:Mark.Guzman@enron.com] Sent: Tuesday, November 07, 2000 12:21 PM To: Katie.Trullinger@wfsg.com Subject: RE: FW: What's up? The fact that you are moving down there has nothing to do with whether or not I do. I was just joking. Stop be so over analytical. :) Did you talk to Danny about the offer?
