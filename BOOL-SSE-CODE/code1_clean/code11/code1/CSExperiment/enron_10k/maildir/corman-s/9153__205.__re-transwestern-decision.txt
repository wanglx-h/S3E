I don't think I've ever in my days as an outhouse and inhouse lawyer worked with a team that was so cohesive and effective. That you guys did it with a group pulled together from two firms as well as in house lawyers is doubly impressive. We appreciate the long hours and sacrifices you all made to get this thing ready and try it in such a short time period. Your timing is impeccable, as having a little good news about Enron out in the marketplace is sorely needed right now! Thanks again guys! DF
