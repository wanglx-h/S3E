Subject: Re: CAISO Notification - Transmission Access Charge Implementation
 - Addition of City of Vernon as PTO
Typically the traders are not interested in changes to the TAC because it is paid by the end-user not by us. However, EES folks (Dennis Benevides, Neil Bresnan, and Jubron Whelan) are usually interested and you can copy the traders with an FYI if you want to. You have probably discovered all this already.

I do not have any sense of whether the proposed change will be accepted, accepted subject to refund, or suspended by FERC. If you need any detail, I think you will find it in one of the ISO's attachments to their filing (the .xls file) which is at www.caiso.com/ferc filings. Cheers, Alan Comnes Earlier Email: Here is another hefty ISO filing that came in this week. Please let Sue or I know if you believe we should intervene/protest. Alan Comnes Summary of ISO Amendment 34: Filed: December 28 Effective Date: 1/1/01 (expedited treatment requested) Protests Due: January 17? (need to confirm this) Filing in a Nutshell: The ISO states that the purpose of the amendment is to clarify certain issues associated with implementation of the new transmission Access Charge methodology it orginally proposed in Amendment No. 27. (According to the ISO, Amendment 27 has been accepted for filing, suspended, and set for hearing. Settlement negotiations are ongoing. (Is Enron a party to these settlements?)) In addition, the ISO provides new transmission Access Charge (TAC) rates that will be in effect if the Commission approves the City of Vernon joining the ISO effective January 1, 2001 and the amount of Firm Transmission Rights that will be given to Vernon in accordance with the ISO Tariff. Specific Proposed Changes Clarification of Wheeling Access Charge Quantity The ISO proposes that these provisions be clarified to specify that in the determination of the Wheeling Access Charge, the proper calculation is to use transmission facility ownership and Entitlements less all Encumbrances. Encumbrances include transmission used to meet demands of existing contracts. This is how the ISO is currently calculating this charge and the ISO appears to be using this filing to codify this method. New HV TAC Rates Using Year-1 of the ISO,s Proposed Transmission Methodology The current Access Charge methodology consists of three separate zone rates based on the Transmission Revenue Requirement of the Original Participating TO. Because each zone corresponds to the service territory of the TO, they are known as &license plate8 rates. Under Amendment No. 27, this methodology continues in effect until a New Participating TO joins the ISO. Once that occurs, the Access Charge for High Voltage Transmission Facilities will be assessed based on the combined High Voltage Transmission Revenue Requirements of all the Participating TOs in each TAC Area. The filing claims to implement an already-approved transition formula wherein new members of the ISO will pay a rate that is a mix license place and system average embedded costs. The goal is that after 10 years there will be only 1 high voltage access charge. The following table shows that under the current method, which would be a 90/10 split of license-plate/system-average charges, PG&E and SCE TO access charges would rise approximately $3.2 million and Vernon would be subsidized approximately $7 million. Calculation of the net (benefits)/burdens from Access Charge and GMC Impact. PG&E and SCE have a $32 Million cap annually and SDG&E has a $8 Million cap annually; Vernon is held harmless; I OUs pay muni cost increases in proportion to their cap relative to the total cap. Adjusted Net (Benefit)/ Burden ($1000) [37] PG&E $3,283 SCE $3,283 SDG&E $821 Vernon ($7,051) Total $336 Note: a positive number means the TAC is going up. A negative number means the TAC is going down (or will be lower than would be the case under 100% license plate ratemaking) Vernon,s Existing Transmission Rights Converted to FTRs Veron, by joining the ISO effective 1/1/01, agrees to convert existing transmission rights to FTRs of presumably an equivalent amount. The proposed FTRs to allocate to Vernon are in the filing. These FTRs will expire when the underlying contract right expires or 10 years, whichever is sooner.

I know it is not much, but we need to build this amount into our transmission curves for these utilities. Roger Susan J Mara@ENRON 01/02/2001 07:42 PM To: Roger Yang/SFO/EES@EES cc: Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron, Mary Hain/HOU/ECT@ECT, Alan Comnes/PDX/ECT@ECT Subject: CAISO Notification - Transmission Access Charge Implementation - Addition of City of Vernon as PTO i thought that Vernon had opposed some of FERC's order on joining, but according to this ISO e-mail,, it looks as if Vernon is now a PTO. PG&E = the northern TAC, SCE = Central, and SDG&E = Southern. I don't recall seeing any filings for the "Low Voltage" rates. I'll have to let you know on those. ----- Forwarded by Susan J Mara/NA/Enron on 01/02/2001 07:35 PM ----- CRCommunications <CRCommunications@caiso.com> 01/02/2001 05:48 PM To: ISO Market Participants <IMCEAEX-_O=CAISO_OU=CORPORATE_CN=DISTRIBUTION+20LISTS_CN=ISO+20MARKET+20PARTI CIPANTS@caiso.com> cc: ISO Client Relations <ISOClientRelations@caiso.com>, SC Settlements Contacts <IMCEAEX-_O=CAISO_OU=CORPORATE_CN=DISTRIBUTION+20LISTS_CN=SCSETTLECONTACTS@cai so.com>, "Kazerooni, Hamid" <HKazerooni@caiso.com>, "Gerber, Spence" <SGerber@caiso.com>, "Le Vine, Debi" <DLeVine@caiso.com>, "Bouillon, Brad" <BBouillon@caiso.com>, "Shafa, Masoud" <MShafa@caiso.com>, "Ng, Chi-Pui" <CNg@caiso.com> Subject: CAISO Notification - Transmission Access Charge Implementation - Addition of City of Vernon as PTO Market Participants: As of January 1, 2001, the City of Vernon has joined the CAISO as a Participating Transmission Owner (PTO) under the CAISO Tariff and Transmission Control Agreement (TCA). According to Amendment 27 of the ISO Tariff, there are three TAC areas: Northern TAC Area, Eastern/Central TAC Area, and Southern TAC Area. The following TAC Area rates for the use of the High Voltage Transmission Facilities are in effect starting January 1, 2001. TAC Area High Voltage Access Charge (TAC Area + ISO-wide) North 1.41 $/MWH East/Central 2.04 $/MWH South 1.99 $/MWH The Low Voltage Access Charge is defined in each PTO's TO Tariff. <<TAC Overview.doc>> CRCommunications Client Relations Communications - TAC Overview.doc
