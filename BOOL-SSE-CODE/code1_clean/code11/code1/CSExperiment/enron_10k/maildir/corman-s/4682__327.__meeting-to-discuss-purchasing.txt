Subject: Meeting to Discuss Purchasing
I would like to meet with all the assistants to discuss purchasing and invoice payments. I have run detailed line items out of SAP for review of expenditures. Please plan to attend a brief meeting in 3960 on Monday, December 17 at 1:00 PM. At that time we will discuss office supply purchases. If you can not attend please let me know. Donna
