On checking an old file for Mr. Krishnarao, I see that you started his Green Card application, based on Outstanding Researcher, in November, 1995. There are also copies of the I-765 in the file, which I assume means that Mr. Krishnarao is already in the Adjustment of Status stage of the process? I would appreciate you letting myself and Michelle Cash know where we are with the application at this time? Hopefully, we are very close to completion! Many thanks Margaret 713-345-1529
