Star Wars Special to Feature Enron This Saturday, March 31, at 6:30 p.m., KPRC Channel 2 will air a half-hour special on Star Wars: The Magic of Myth, currently on exhibit at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. Hosted by Roseann Rogers of News 2 Houston's the "Buzz," the show also features Enron's own Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President of Human Resources and Community Relations. When Star Wars made its debut, it was the most innovative and technologically advanced film of the time. Its creator changed not only the type of entertainment the masses would view but also how films and their effects were created. It,s a motion picture icon and remains a world phenomenon. This focus on technology and entertainment also led to our decision to make sure this exhibit made its way to Houston. Technology is what drives business today and the synergy of entertainment and technology brought out in Star Wars: The Magic of Myth was a perfect fit for Enron. We also hope you take the opportunity to view the Star Wars exhibit and Enron ) The Journey Begins in the hallway by the Caf, Express cantina in the Museum. This &mini-exhibit8 showcases Enron. This is our way of not only educating the public about Enron and what we do, but to also shows how anyone can take an idea and bring it to life, like George Lucas did with Star Wars.
