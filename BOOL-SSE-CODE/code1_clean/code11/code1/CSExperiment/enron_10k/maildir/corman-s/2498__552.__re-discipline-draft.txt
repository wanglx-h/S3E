This is fine, but is it harsh enough? -----Original Message----- From: Herman, Ben Sent: Monday, November 26, 2001 1:41 PM To: Cash, Michelle Subject: discipline draft Importance: High Michelle, Below is a draft discipline letter for your approval. It is intended to be used with employees who are determined to be posting to web-based bulleting boards during company hours. You approved this a year or so ago, but I wanted to run it by you again in case anything has changed. Ben ******** NAME, An investigation has determined that you have participated in discussions on web-based bulletin boards during working hours. Your comments, posted using company equipment and using a name intended to hide your identity, concerned Enron issues that could possibly be construed as insider information. This activity is in direct violation of Enron's Code of Ethics. <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /> You are to immediately cease this activity and come into compliance with Enron's Code of Ethics. Repeated violations will subject you to further discipline, up to and including termination. Supervisor/HR Rep DATE
