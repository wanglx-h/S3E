Ellis and Gary should both attend. -----Original Message----- From: Barnes, Caroline Sent: Monday, January 28, 2002 1:32 PM To: Hayslett, Rod Subject: Monday morning Dynegy Meeting? Shelley mentioned in her staff meeting that there would be a Dynegy Operations Meeting every Monday morning at 9:30 for the shared personnel to attend. Can you please let me know if this is something Ellis or Gary should attend since measurement results and PPAs are a hot topic for NNG. cvb
