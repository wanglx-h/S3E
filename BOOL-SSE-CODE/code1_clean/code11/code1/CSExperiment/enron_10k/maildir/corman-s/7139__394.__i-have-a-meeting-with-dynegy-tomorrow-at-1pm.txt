Subject: I have a meeting with Dynegy tomorrow at 1pm
The provisional agenda is: Hiring protocol - agree wording. Suggestion: No severance payment from Enron, no 4 or 5 performers, and minimum 90 day sit out for all no-compete individuals. Severance update: illustration of current and revised plans which we have yet to decide on. Overview of Nov 27 areas of headcount reduction. More detailed overview of HR planned re-structuring (still high level - although I would be interested in seeing if she is interested in any potentially redundant talent) Overview of retention plan. Please comment. Tim/Scott, please help prepare pack I will need and make sure legal are ok with what we all agree to hand over to her on above. David
