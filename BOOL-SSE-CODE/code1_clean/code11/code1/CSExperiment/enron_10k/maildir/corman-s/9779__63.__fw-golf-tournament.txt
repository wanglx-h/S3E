Do you want to play in this scramble - I've played the last two years - dinner and prizes included.....Let me know. -----Original Message----- From: Coffey Jr., Jim Sent: Wednesday, September 05, 2001 1:39 PM To: Phillips, George Subject: FW: Golf Tournament George Here is the information on the Golf Tournament. In the past three years we have raised over $187,000 benefiting Texas Children's Hospital Bone Marrow Transplant Unit through His Grace Foundation (HGF). HGF supplies gift baskets, meals, parking, and other services (laundry, grocery shopping, banking, post office, etc?) to patients and their families, including several Enron families in the past. Hopefully you will considering playing in and sponsoring a team in our 2001 tournament. Let me know if you have any questions or need any more info. I have included a registration form as well as a flyer with more tournament details. Hope to see you on the Green! Jim Coffey, Jr. <Embedded Picture (Metafile)>
