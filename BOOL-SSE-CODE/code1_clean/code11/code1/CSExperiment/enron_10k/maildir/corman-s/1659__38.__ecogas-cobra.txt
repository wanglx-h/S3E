Subject: Ecogas COBRA
Michelle, Thanks for forwarding the COBRA e-mails to me. After reading them, I am confused as to where we stand. The people listed below are on Ecogas COBRA and I suspect that they have not been presented with the option of switching to Enron COBRA. At the very least, I do not think it has been presented to them in the light that Ecogas COBRA will soon be nonexistent. Could someone in your shop send (or resend) COBRA packets to the people listed below? I will send a letter to the same list to let them know that they need to switch or lose coverage after January 1, 2001. This may be duplicating earlier efforts, but I want to make sure that no one falls through the cracks after we dissolve Ecogas. Thanks, Kelly Mahmoud Alan Erwin 3 Jeffrey Cove Austin, TX 78746 Robert P. Green 15619 Domart Ave. Norwalk, CA 90650 Thomas Hall 1815 W. 37th St. Austin, TX 78731 Donald J. Hazen 600 Muro Cr.
