Thanks man I feel like the old man that I am. I only have 5 years until it gets really bad. Hunting was great the dog did great, he tried to attack a bull and went tearing through the brush I thought that I would never find him. After he settled down he did great. Thanks for keeping the family. Tiffany told me that you guys taught her how to CALL THE HOGS. Brad
