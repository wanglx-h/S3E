Subject: Guest List for Shower
Hi Shelley: I am getting out invitations for the shower today. I am sending one to you and Alina so you can see it. Here is the guest list so far: Giok Boothe Lisa Corder Linda Corredor (co-hosting) Jacque Daughtry Sydney Free Duvall Peggy Erwin Nancy Ginsburg Dawn Goddin Ange Grout Wendy Houghton Barbara Howard Stephanie Keesling Carla McGinley Kathy Mynarcik Becky O'Reilly Dorothy Pledger Letha Russell Pam Thyssen Ann Turney Patty Wehn-Glowski I do need to clarify the following: 1) Did you say yes to inviting Tami Head? (My notes aren't clear.) 2) You listed Cherie Otto on your list. I know that she and Barbara Bakanic are very close friends. Barbara is also in our S/S class when she is not teaching. Do you think we should invite both of them? 3) You were going to get me Gabby's (sp?) address. 4) I thought of Maggie Van Syckle. Are you close with her? If there's any one else you think of, just let me know. Thanks, Barbara
