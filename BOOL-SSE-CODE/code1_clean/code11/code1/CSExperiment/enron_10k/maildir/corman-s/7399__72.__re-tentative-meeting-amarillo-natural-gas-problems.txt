Ava told me you were on Jury Duty on Monday. I meant Tuesday, Oct. 30th, if you are that day. Sorry for the mistake.

The reason it is tenatively is because Lynn has Jury Duty selection on Monday and if picked, she will not be here...maybe! Date: Monday, Oct. 29th Time: 9:00 am Place: Lynn's Office Any questions, please let me know. Randy
