Subject: RE: good morning
Would you wanna go see a movie or have a few beers or something? I have to stay out late tonight so I can get used to the new nighttime schedule and if I just sit at home i will fall asleep. I am going to try and stay up really late and then sleep really late tommorow morning to prepare.
