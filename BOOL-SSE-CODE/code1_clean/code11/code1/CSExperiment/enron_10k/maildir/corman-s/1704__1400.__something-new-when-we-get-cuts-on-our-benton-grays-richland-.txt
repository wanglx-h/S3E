Subject: Something new when we get cuts on our Benton, Grays, Richland, and
 Franklin Transmission
Please do not just change the volume of these transmission deals, the unused portion needs to be kept in scheduling, as MidC to MidC transmission. Please take a moment to look at November 29th in Scheduling for an example of this. The reason: We have to pay for all of this transmission whether we use it or not, and just changing the volume makes us off with them for settlements. I will be happy to help you if you need it. c
