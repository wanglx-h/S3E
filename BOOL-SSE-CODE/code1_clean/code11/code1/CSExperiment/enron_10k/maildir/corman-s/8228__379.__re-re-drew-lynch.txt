no, it looked suspicious, so I didn't open it. Fax is 713-646-3490. -----Original Message----- From: Aggar, Brenda Sent: Wednesday, December 19, 2001 8:33 AM To: Cash, Michelle Subject: RE Drew Lynch Hi Michelle I have had trouble with my e-mails, I hope you didn't open the one with the virus that went to all of my sent addresses yesterday.
