Subject: RE: October (Forward) Positive Displacement Meter PPA Status
I have not sent out the letter to Alliant yet as I need to address this issue. I'll need to wait for for your response. -----Original Message----- From: Blair, Lynn Sent: Tue 12/18/2001 8:31 AM To: Sebesta, Chris; Floyd, Jodie Cc: Semin, Frank Subject: RE: October (Forward) Positive Displacement Meter PPA Status Chris, I only got info on the Mid Am Oct. charts. I talked to Gary again yesterday and ask for more information. Hopefully I'll have something today. Have you already sent your letter to Alliant? Thanks. Lynn -----Original Message----- From: Sebesta, Chris Sent: Friday, December 14, 2001 9:41 AM To: Blair, Lynn; Floyd, Jodie Cc: Semin, Frank Subject: October (Forward) Positive Displacement Meter PPA Status Lynn, any update yet from Gary or Caroline as to the updates you requested in your December 11 email? I am finalizing a letter to Alliant and would like to provide them with an expectation as to the October PPA's. Specifically, will all the October charts be corrected? Further, Alliant wants Gas Logistics to tag the PPA's. Specifically, Alliant requested the differences are identified by gate and amount of change. Is this possible?
