Subject: Re: Bushton Plant down 5/26-27
I am very interested in how they are going to "fix Saturday" on Tuesday. We cannot go back in and adjust noms or scheduled volumes. Please let me know the results of thier adjustments. Thanks.

I talked with Jimmie Mosher and she said they will correct noms. for the differences on those days when everyone is back in the office on Tuesday. The plant did not notify her that there was a problem, so a timely fix was not an option. They called our gas control. I found out when I did the reports for the 26th on Monday, the 28th. Janet
