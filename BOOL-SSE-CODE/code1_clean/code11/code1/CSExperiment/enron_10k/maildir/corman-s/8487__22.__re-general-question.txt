What do you mean by backdating? I think our policy has been to make those current or close to current at the time of signing. -----Original Message----- From: Rozen, Tara Sent: Friday, September 21, 2001 9:34 AM To: Cash, Michelle; Sweet, Twanda Subject: General question Hello, there. Hope you both are doing well. Do we have any rules about backdating the US Exec agreements? We have someone who has been negotiating a contract for about 6 months now and he wants the contract backdated. I do not want to backdate it but need some support to say that we don't do this (if we don't, of course). Thanks! Tara
