Subject: Change in procedure for Preschedules between Enron and BPA
Per a phone conversation between Matt and myself, the follwing changes to the way Enron communicates with BPA Prescheduling will begin as of 6/27/01: 1. A daily E-mail for contracts that do not have a third party coordinator will not be sent. Any direct schedules between BPA and Enron will be communicated Via Phone. 2. Contracts that involve a third party coordinator (PRM for the GAC and NAC, WWP for the Kaiser) will have a sheet created and e-mailed daily with the following changes. 1. A preliminary sheet with paths completed up to 9:15 am will be e-mailed no later than 9:30 2. A final sheet with all paths completed will be sent as soon as the last paths are recieved from our counterparties and confirmed. A phone call will follow this e-mail to ensure that BPA knows when it was sent. If this scenario does not provide a satisfactory result for both BPA and Enron, then other solutions can be explored at that time. Please feel free to e-mail or phone me with any questions Cara Semperger West Power Scheduling Supervisor 503/464-3814
