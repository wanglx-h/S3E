I am concerned that the Parliamentary Committee (as chosen by Boswell) will be ruling on the pipeline issue about the make-up of that Parliamentary Committee so will it get an unbiased review? I hope so but I think we need to convince Boswell to have a pipeline on the Parliamentary Committee, particularly since the pipelines are the ones who have been the most active group and therefore have the most knowledge and experience of how things should work.
