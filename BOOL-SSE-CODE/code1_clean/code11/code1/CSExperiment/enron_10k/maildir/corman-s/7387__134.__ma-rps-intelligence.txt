Subject: MA RPS intelligence
All - I heard that National Grid is actively lobbying the Governor against signing the implementation of the RPS, (based on the universal applicability to utilities) scheduled to begin in '03. The legislature passed the RPS as part of the restructuring package, and it went to the Division of Energy Resources for implementation. Many of you recall that we served on the advisory committee to the DOER and were actively involved with the draft reg to ensure fair implementation. The RPS regs as they were drafted by the advisory committee are currently before the Governor Swift's staff for evaluation. The RPS requirement as defined in statute is placed on all retail sellers according to the following percentages of sales: 1% by 12/31/03; an additional .5% of sales each year thereafter until 12/31/09; and an add'l .5% of sales for every year thereafter until a date TBD by the Division of Energy Resources from new renewable resources. Unless there is legislation to overturn the statute, the RPS will go forward. However, the implementation regs might be delayed. I'll keep you posted as to the outcome.
