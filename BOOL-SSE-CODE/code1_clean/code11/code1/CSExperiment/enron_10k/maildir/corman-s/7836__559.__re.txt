It's been canceled. There were no unauthorized withdrawals. It very well may be in the pocket of one of my blazers at home, but I didn't want to take any chances. It's inactivated & I'll have to go to the local branch if I want a new ATM card with non-debit features. The automated service only offers replacement cards with debit features. -----Original Message----- From: Erb, Kim [mailto:KErb@houston.deepwater.com] Sent: Tuesday, March 05, 2002 9:53 AM To: Shelley Corman (E-mail) Subject: Q, We may end early today (about 1:00 or 2:00). I can address it then. When did you lose it? Thank God it is not a Debit Card. Kim
