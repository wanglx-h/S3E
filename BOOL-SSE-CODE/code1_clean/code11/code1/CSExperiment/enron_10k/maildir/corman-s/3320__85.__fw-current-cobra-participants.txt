Thanks, Steve -----Original Message----- From: Marie Sent: Thursday, December 07, 2000 4:46 PM To: Kelly Mahmoud; Steve Hamilton Subject: Current Cobra participants What happens to those people that are currently on Ecogas cobra when Ecogas is no longer in existence? They have not utilized the 18 months that they would be entitled to receive those benefits. Is Enron going to pick them up like they did for the 10/13/00 layoff? Do we need to direct this question to someone at Enron? Marie
