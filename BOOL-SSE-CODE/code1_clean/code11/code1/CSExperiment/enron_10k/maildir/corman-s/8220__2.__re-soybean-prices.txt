Subject: Re: Soybean prices
Rex: Sorry I accidentally sent the email before I had finished. I just wanted to make you aware of this. I know very little about these two crops, but as a trader I see an opportunity to sell soybeans and buy corn. I am thinking about buying a dec corn call. I will keep you informed of any changes.
