Telecom was just here and informed me that it would take place tomorrow, May 30th. However, they could not tell me if his phone mod would take place AM or PM. His e-mail is working, so Alma could pass this information on to his group. Thank you, Ricki -----Original Message----- From: Daily, Pamela Sent: Thursday, May 24, 2001 7:09 PM To: Salinardo, John; Martin, Judy Cc: Winters, Ricki Subject: Churn request #4017 Importance: High John, I am submitting this online churn request #4017 as a modification to Bill Cordes' Houston information instead of a new request for Brad Holmes because Brad does not yet have a badge number. He will be assuming an existing office (EB4197) and phone number (x3-3432), previously assigned to Bill Cordes for his use when traveling to Houston. Please let me know if you need me to revise it later. Thanks!
