Subject: RE: 39C1 Get Together
My preference is to send out the notice as a Staff Meeting w/ Halloween Snacks. I'd rather it be just us for this meeting. -----Original Message----- From: Scott, Donna Sent: Wednesday, October 24, 2001 11:25 AM To: Corman, Shelley Subject: 39C1 Get Together Shelley, 39C1 is available from 3:00 - 4:00 pm on Tuesday, Oct. 30. Would you like to have a social get together for your groups? I was thinking of maybe a Halloween cake and ice cream social. Maybe even invite marketing. What are your thoughts? Donna
