Shelley: Yes, we can!! My Bible Study starts at 5pm. I have an hour! We may change the Bible Study to an earlier time though due to the Super Bowl and then I will have more than an hour. Either way...I know I will be there. Please know I am praying for you for strength and perseverance as you contine to be with Enron. I am sure things are not really comfortable right now but I sure am glad they have a wonderful light of Christ's witness like you to be among all the darkness. My heart is still mourning the gentleman who ended his life. I pray there will be no one else. Alina grows in leaps and bounds each day. I see her at ACEC and she is pure delight. She yells a greeting to me when she sees me and it lights up my heart. I am not sure what she is saying but we know each other and it really thrills me to see her smile and her little hand waving. She is such a blessing! Everyone shows her so much love. At Sunday school last week we all really gave Chad encouragment and affirmation that he is now the big brother. He seemed pleased and a wee bit shy about all the attention. Hope and pray we were not toooo much for him. Shelly, if you ever get stuck for someone to keep the kids for a while...I would be honored if my schedule permits. Just wanted you to know! Thanks for all you do and are doing! I can't wait to begin beating the drum for VBS. In Him, Patty
