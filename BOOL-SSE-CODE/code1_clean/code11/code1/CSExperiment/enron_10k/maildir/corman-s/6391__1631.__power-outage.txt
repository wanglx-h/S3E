Subject: Power Outage
At approximately 5:00pm Tice Electrical will be shutting down partial power in the first two rows of the trading floor. Anything plugged into the orange colored outlets will not be affected, however any workstations, monitors, or anything else not plugged into the orange outlets will lose power for about 15-20 minutes. The two Real Time desks will not be affected with any power loss but it's possible other workstations within these two rows might lose power. If anyone is still in the office and working you will receive fair warning before the outage takes place. Everyone in the first two rows (excluding real time) please shut down your computer before leaving tonight. If you have any questions please contact myself or Debra Davidson. Thanks, Chip Cox
