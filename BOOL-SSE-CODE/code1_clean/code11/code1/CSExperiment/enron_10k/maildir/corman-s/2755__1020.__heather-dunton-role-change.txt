Subject: Heather Dunton Role Change
All, I would like to take this opportunity to inform everyone that effective March 1, (Today) Heather Dunton has moved into a new role with the West Desk Risk Management Group reporting to Stacey White in Houston. It has been a pleasure working with Heather over the last 2 years in the Volume Management Group. She has enabled us (Enron) to take our services business to levels which would not have been possible with out her. Her detailed knowledge of our internal / external customer needs along with her in-depth knowledge of California tariffs and operational protocol have made her an invaluable asset to the team. Her contributions will be missed. Please join me in wishing Heather as much success in her new role. Thanks - MO
