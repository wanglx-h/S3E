Subject: CAISO Notice - Clarification on Market Stabilization Plan Filing
 	at FERC
ISO Market Participants: Earlier today, I sent a message announcing a conference call next Tuesday to discuss implementation issues surrounding the ISO's proposed Market Stabilization Plan. In that message, I implied that the ISO would be filing the Market Stabilization Plan with FERC this week. The filing we plan to submit to FERC this week is only the ISO's comments on the FERC staff's own Market Power Monitoring and Mitigation Proposal. We do not plan to file the Market Stabilization Plan until after the March 30 Board meeting. I apologize for any confusion this may have caused. Byron B.
