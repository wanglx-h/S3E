Per our conversation. Any help you can offer in determing that this adjustment is/is not legitimate will be appreciated. The PJM bills only reflect bulk adjustments from the scheduled to the actual load--no detail of this level is provided. Thanks.

Can you take a look at and see if you agree or even if there is a way that you can ascertain if the correction made by PECO Energy Company is valid?
