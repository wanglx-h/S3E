Subject: Shelley's Staff Meeting
Would you two be able to attend Shelley's staff meeting for me on Monday, February 11th? I will be at Alliant Energy in Wisconsin with Lynn Blair and Jodie Floyd to resolve some A/R, measurement and scheduling issues. Please take notes and pass them along to me on Tuesday. Rick
