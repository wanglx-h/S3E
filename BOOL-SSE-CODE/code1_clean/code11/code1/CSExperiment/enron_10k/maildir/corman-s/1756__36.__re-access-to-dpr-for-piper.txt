grant him access -----Original Message----- From: Beck, Sally Sent: Friday, August 03, 2001 5:08 PM To: Whalley, Greg Cc: Piper, Greg Subject: Access to DPR for Piper Greg Piper has asked for daily access to the DPR via the Executive Viewer. In keeping with our policy of limited access to the data, I thought that it would be best to check with you on this request. Greg appreciates our diligence in monitoring requests for access and understands that I am running this request by you. Let me know what you would like for us to do. Thanks.
