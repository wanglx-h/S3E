Looking at Earnings estimates I think they are under estimating the long term shift in natural gas prices. 90 days ago they had next year earnings $.17 under this year and only resently have they started to raise 2001 earnings to account for were prices are. I image that are still under estimating next year earnings based on where the strip of natural gas is. I don't think most people expected gas next summer to be trading over $4.55 Dec 00 Mar 01 This Year - Dec 00 Next Year Dec 01 Long Term Growth Current 7 Days Ago 30 Days Ago 60 Days Ago 90 Days Ago 0.93 0.93 0.82 0.67 0.60 0.92 0.92 0.78 0.59 0.59 2.70 2.70 2.57 2.33 2.14 2.78 2.78 2.52 2.15 1.97 9.05% 9.05% 9.24% 10.20% 10.20%
