Subject: NEW PORTLAND IT #503-464-7376
Good Afternoon, The IT shop in Portland now has a new Bat Phone to contact IT 24 hours a day 7 days a week. Please call us at 503-464-7376 and this number will ring at the production support phones during work hours or inform you of the on-call pager number during off-hours or weekends. As always, we still love walk-up visits and direct phone calls, but if there is ever a question of who to call, this number is always available. Thanks, IT Production Support
