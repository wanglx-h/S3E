Subject: New Morning Meeting Report
Wanted to give everyone an update on the status of the new report format for the morning meeting: The report is completed for all information except: Storage Operational Capacity Current and Accum Imbalances The group working on this feels they will have all pieces of information available and the report completed by June 15, 2001. The above referenced fields have been a challenge to get the data base populated as needed. But this group has done an excellent job in striving to give us an accurate report and not giving up on possibilities. As you are aware, Gary and Darrell have already started using the report and we have changed how we report outages and allocations. Storage will change once the new report is completed. Don Powell and Dale Ratliff have been an excellent resource and very helpful to ensure we get the product we need. If you have any other questions or any concerns about not getting the new report before June 15th, please let me know. Thanks. Lynn
