Privileged and Confidential In our meeting on Friday, we talked about the summary of complaints that you three are going to do. If possible, I would like to receive those by Tuesday night so that they can be reviewed on Wednesday. We are meeting with Beck/Olson on Thursday. Let me know if that is impossible -- I know you all are swamped with zillions of other things! Thanks. Michelle
