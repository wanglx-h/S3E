Subject: [Footballguys] News Update - Mike Anderson to Start
As we passed along to you yesterday, ESPNews was reporting that Olandis Gary might get the starting nod for this weeks game. It was reported in several places, including CBS Sportsline. Now CBS Sportsline is offering this http://football0.commissioner.com/mp/pro-home?league=zero : "Contrary to some earlier reports, Anderson will remain the starter in Denver's backfield for now. Some reports had indicated that Olandis Gary would start in his place." This seems to be consistent with what the local Denver press is saying as well. Clearly, nothing is for certain with a Mike Shanahan Running Back Corps but for now, it looks like Anderson is back as the starter although I wouldn't be surprised to see Gary see some carries as well. Thanks to Footballguy Bob Harris for sending me the email on this one which he entitled "the truth shall set you free"... Joe /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Bryant Analytics, Inc.
