Subject: FW: Shelley Corman - Out of the office email address
FYI. Just to let you know, Shelley is trying to minimize emails she gets to preserve space on her Blackberry. But wanted to keep you in the loop in case you needed to send her something. Thanks.

Accessing her Compuserve account is much easier and faster than accessing mail.enron.com. The address is: cormanerb@cs.com <mailto:cormanerb@cs.com> Please forward on to your team as you see fit. If you have any questions please call me on my cell phone at 713-859-6238. Thanks, Jean
