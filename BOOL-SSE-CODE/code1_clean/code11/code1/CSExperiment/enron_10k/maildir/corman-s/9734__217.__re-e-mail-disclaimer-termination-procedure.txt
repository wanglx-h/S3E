Michelle Christa Winfrey 04/13/2000 01:20 PM To: Michelle Cash/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Kristin Walsh/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: E-mail disclaimer/Termination Procedure Michelle, Thank you very much for reviewing and returning the Termination Procedure that my group, ENA Competitive Analysis & Business Controls, has been working on. Marissa Womble forwarded the edited procedure to me, and I will make the necessary changes to the document. I truly appreciate your knowledge and legal expertise, especially in this matter. Please note that Marissa Womble has rotated into a new group; therefore, please contact either Kristin Walsh (ext. 3-9510) or myself (ext. 3-9307) regarding any future policies and procedures. Thank you, Christa Winfrey
