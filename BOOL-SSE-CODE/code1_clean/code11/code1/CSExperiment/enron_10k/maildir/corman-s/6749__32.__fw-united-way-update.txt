Enron's plan calls for Leadership Givers to represent 60% of the total pledge goal, so we are short 21.69% or $276,768. Even more disappointing was the weak 7.85% participation rate by those employees in the Leadership level (i.e., over $90,000 in base pay). While part of this shortfall was caused by the decision not to conduct a Leadership campaign for EBS, most of the other business units/functional groups in EWS did not fare too well either. Below are the pledge totals and participation rates by functional group: GROUP PLEDGES % Participation EA $79,485 10.78% EBS $14,555 1.31% EEOS $32,143 18.18% EEL $6,104 14.29% EGM $74,030 11.53% EIM $62,567 21.62% ENW $77,960 3.82% EWS Bus.

Here are the other groups' totals: ETS $146,466 12.92% Corporate $359,925 10.07% EES $131,439 6.56% If you have any questions, please call me at ext. 3-9053. Eric
