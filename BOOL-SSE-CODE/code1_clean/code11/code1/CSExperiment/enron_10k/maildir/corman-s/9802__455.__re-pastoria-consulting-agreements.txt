Subject: Re: Pastoria - Consulting Agreements
I'll take care of it today. Michelle Karen E Jones 11/16/2000 06:05 PM To: Michelle Cash/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Samuel Wehn/HOU/ECT@ECT, Eric Thode/Corp/Enron@ENRON Subject: Pastoria - Consulting Agreements Michelle, Sam told me that Gene Tackett and Kathy Russeth have approved the form of consulting agreements you prepared, and everyone is ready to sign. Please send initialled, execution copies to Sam, and we will have Dave Parquet sign them. I need to request urgency on this, as the documents are relevant (from a due diligence perspective) to our larger Pastoria transaction. Thanks.
