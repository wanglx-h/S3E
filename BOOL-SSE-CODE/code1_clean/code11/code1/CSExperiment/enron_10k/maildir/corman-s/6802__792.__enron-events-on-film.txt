Enron Events are now available for your viewing pleasure in scrapbook form. The scrapbooks are located on top of the Pharmacopia cabinet by Real Time. They have pictures from the Enron Holiday Party 2000 and Ski Weekend 2001. Negatives have been kept, so you may order photos. Please promptly return scrapbooks if you take them from their new home. Thanks!
