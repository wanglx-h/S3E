Subject: Issues for RRG Meeting
Paul-welcome back. I have taken the following positions that may (or may not) come up at the RRG meeting. Even if the issues don't come up, I wanted to give you an update:  The security coordinator (SC) should be part of the RTO. In the NW, the SC contracts with the utilities. The proposal is to have the RTO contract with the SC . In the East, Tabors studied SCs and found they allowed the transmission owners (TO) to discriminate. However, there, the SC is employed by the TO. I need to know more about how the NW SC contract is structured and talk to Tabors before I would feel comfortable giving up on this issue. Do others have opinions on this?  I support moving the load integration agreement (LIA) and generation integration agreement (GIA) into the tariff. I am developing momentum for this.  Concerning governance, I drafted a paper opposing state agencies voting for board members. I also oppose a member class for a catchall member class. I would also oppose a class for the state commissions if they are given the right tovote for directors.
