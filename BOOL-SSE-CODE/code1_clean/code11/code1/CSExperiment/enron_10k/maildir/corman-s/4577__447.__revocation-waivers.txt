Subject: Revocation Waivers
I would appreciate your help in communicating to the HR community that signed waivers related to the revocation of job offers are to be placed in two locations: (1) original to the vault; and (2) a copy to the application file kept by HR regarding the individual. Thanks, --Lizzette
