Subject: SUPPLEMENTAL COUNTERPARTIES
Group, Good afternoon. I know we have all heard it before, BUT, it is still going on... When entering new deals in the supplemental section of caps, PLEASE make sure that the counterparty is ECTRT and NOT ECT. When the counterparty is ECT, the money (OUR MONEY) would theoretically be spread over the whole floor. Again, I know that you have heard this at least 5 times already, therefore... IF you have any questions...PLEASE...ask me!!! Bill
