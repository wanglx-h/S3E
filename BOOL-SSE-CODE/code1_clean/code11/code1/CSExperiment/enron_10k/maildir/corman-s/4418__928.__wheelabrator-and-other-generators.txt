Group, From now on do not sell the generator's schedules real time for all day or for a good portion of the day like we used to because the ISO has been cutting our exports at NOB in conjunction with our gen schedules. Per Chris Foster, if we decide to sell any of the gen schedules real time we only do it for a couple of hours at a time. That way when we see that the ISO cuts the exports we can immediately cut the gen schedule. This is the way I was told to proceed in these cases in the future. If you have any questions ask Chris or Bill thanks, Monika
