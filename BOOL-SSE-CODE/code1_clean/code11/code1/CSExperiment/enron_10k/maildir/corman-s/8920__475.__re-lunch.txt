Great Rosemary, I'm so slow in thanking you for the lovely party. You are the best. My sister will be here for our lunch on Monday too. We're going to be out shopping that day. -----Original Message----- From: RWSchatzman@aol.com [mailto:RWSchatzman@aol.com] Sent: Thursday, February 14, 2002 1:20 PM To: Corman, Shelley; Nicolay, Christi L.
